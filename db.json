      "body": "A DIVINE CALL TO HOLY WOMEN FOR ENDTIME GOSPEL EXPLOIT.     **\n\nINTRODUCTION      **\nWe all attest to the present situation of the churches of God everywhere in the world. There is no time we need more labourers in the field of evangelism and gospel service than now. But observing the characteristics of men in Christ's Churches, we notice to our dismay that the men are asleep in sin; the men are afraid of confronting the roaring Satan; hence the men are absent from the churches of God. This is true because a look at weekly church activities and worship will show you that men are scanty and the women are more in number. The few men available are not zealous or vibrant.     **\nThese are the days of Deborah; the Lord is raising women and pouring His Spirit upon them for end time ministry and gospel exploits. Let the men be jealous of this and repent of their lukewarmness and lethargy. This book is written to give women Spirit led inspiration and motivation for the gospel ministry. The Lord who is calling His daughters to Christian ministry in all respects will be with them and will make them fruitful in the field of His service. Expect great revival from Christian women of our time. The Lord is on His way.    **\nMatthew 28 verse 18 to 20     **\n\t“And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. \n\tGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost  \n\tTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you  and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.”       **\n\nCHAPTER ONE      **\n Priscilla was a daughter of God and the wife of Aquila.  Both of them were great ministers of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.  They became prominent under the ministry of Apostle Paul.    \n\n1.1 Priscilla's Acquaintance with Paul    **\n\nActs 18 verse1 to 3   **\n\n “After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;\n\n And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) and came unto them.\n\nAnd because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought  for by their occupation they were tentmakers.”  ** \n\nPaul the Apostle became acquainted with Aquila and Priscilla in Corinth when he came there for gospel work. He got attracted to them and stayed with them because they were into the same profession of tent-making, hence they had a good long stay together. That was a great\nprivilege to Aquila household. Paul the apostle was a nobleman of wisdom, full of grace, insight, and passion for God. He had a great calling and sold himself for the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Living in the same house and compound with such a person was a rare privilege Priscilla took cognizance of and grabbed with both hands. **\n\nIn a similar account, the Shunammite woman perceived that Elisha was not an ordinary man, but a great and holy prophet of God that deserved special honour. She said to her husband,  **\n\n“I perceive that this is a holy man of God”.\n\nElisha was passing by their house on a regular basis. The Shunammite woman and her husband agreed to provide accommodation for Elisha in their house any time he came around. Elisha's presence in that house turned the situation of the woman around as she gave birth to a child after many years of barreness. In the case of Priscilla, she was not barren but hungry for God. Her hunger and thirst for God received satisfaction as she took full advantage of her friendly interaction with Apostle Paul.   **\n\nProverbs 13 verse 20    **\n\n“He that walketh with wise men shall be wise but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.”   **\n\n1.2 Priscilla Was a Faithful Student Under\n\nPaul's Mentorship    **\n \nPhilippians 4 verse 9     **\n\n“ Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do  and the God of peace shall be with you.”     *\n\nTo be effective and fruitful in the Christian life and ministry you should learn from those the Lord has advanced, who have proven testimony of holy Christian life and ministry.      **\n\nHebrews 13 verse 7     **\n\n Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God  whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.    **\n\n\nPhilippians 3 verse 17     **\n\n Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.   **\n\nPeople should take advantage of the truth that comes out of these true ministers of the gospel in order to be blessed. It will be miserable for one to be married to a true minister of God and yet miss the privilege of entering heaven.     **\n\nGenesis 19 verse 26    **\n\n But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.     **\n\n\nPriscilla remains a good example. She allowed herself to be mentored by Apostle Paul when Paul was residing at her house in Corinth. Priscilla took advantage of that opportunity along with Aquila to listen to Paul and did whatever he instructed her to do. The Holy Scripture shows how Priscilla sacrificed her house for the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ in order to reach out to others. There is a blessed reward when you obey and humble yourself under true and genuine ministers of the gospel.     **\n \nJames 1 verse 22 to 25     **\n\n“ But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.\n\n For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass\nFor he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.\n\nBut whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continue therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.”    **\n\nPriscilla was not a hypocrite like the Pharisees. The Pharisees built the graves of prophets and painted them white to honour God but inwardly practiced deceit. They claimed that if it were in their days, they would not have killed the prophets of God as did their fathers. In other words, they would have treated the prophets nicely and with respect. By character, Pharisees are usually self-righteous people, full of hypocrisy. Jesus examined their hearts and pronounced woe on them. The Pharisees on several occasions attempted to kill Jesus, the greatest of all prophets. Aquila and Priscilla were different. They were perfect examples of obedient children of God. They demonstrated humility and supported the work of God as carried out by the Apostle Paul. We desire that women in Holiness Movement should submit to the teachings and mentorship of Holiness Revival Movement and her leadership; They should live genuine Christian lives, without hypocrisy.    **\n\n1.3\tPaul Commended Pricilla and Aquila    **\n\nFirst Corinthians 16 verse 19      **\n\n“ The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.”   **\n\nPaul on behalf of Priscilla and Aquila, extended a special salutation to the church of Corinth in an expression of the friendly role the two played by accommodating the church in their house for the salvation of souls. Paul counted Priscilla and Aquila as worthy, righteous and faithful disciples in their service to God. He counted them worthy by mentioning their names in the Book of eternity, the holy Bible. Priscilla and Aquila were co-workers with Paul in the propagation of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Follow God wholeheartedly along with your believing husband. Open your house to the worship of God.    **\n\nRomans 16 verse 3 to 4    **\n\n“ Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus\n Who have for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.”     **\n\nSeveral scripture references show that Priscilla's name appeared ahead of her husband's in Paul's letters. This may be due to the prominent role she played and her commitment to the gospel work. In one of such instances, Priscilla and Aquila accompanied Paul to Ephesus for gospel work and this was duly acknowledged by Paul. Engage yourself in soul winning activities as Priscilla did.    **\n\n\nCHAPTER TWO    **\nPRISCILLA WAS HIGHLY COMMITTED TO THE GOSPEL WORK    **\n\nActs 18 verse18 to19    **\n\n“And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea for he had a vow.\n\n And he came to Ephesus, and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.”   **\n\nPaul took with him Priscilla and Aquila on his trip to Syria and Ephesus. This showed the level of their commitment.    **\n\n2.1.  Priscilla  Served  God  Wholeheartedly Without Excuse   **\n\nMany women give complaints and excuses concerning God's work.\n\nPriscilla's actions in the gospel work with Paul showed that she was not a careless or selfish woman in her quest to serve the Lord. She was desirous to serve God regardless of the potential risks. Her heart was in total submission to the Lord. In today's context, some gospel ministers' wives may choose to take the back seat by giving unworthy excuses to their God-fearing husbands rather than cooperating with them in the gospel work. Such women do not want to take risks and always look for the slightest excuses to avoid doing the work of God. A case in point is the wife of one of my coordinators who gave me an excuse when I asked her to teach in a Bible Study class. She sent me a text message saying that she could not teach in a crowd due to shyness. The Lord spoke to me that I should insist and make her do the task assigned. She ended up teaching in that Bible Study class and she did well. This tells us that there are privileges that God brings to your way and you must not play shyness or timidity at them. Do not excuse yourself from God's precious work!    **\n\nJeremiah 1 verse 4 to10   **\n\n“Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,\n\nBefore I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.\n\n Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak for I am a child.\n But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child  for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.\n\n Be not afraid of their faces  for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.\n Then the LORD put forth His hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put My words in thy mouth.\n\n\n See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant”.   **\n\nWives of Christian leaders should stop giving excuses in the ministry work. Priscilla never gave excuses for the gospel work. She was always supportive and loyal to the gospel work with Paul along with her husband, Aquila. Righteousness, holiness, and truth is in your hands. Do not deprive people of it. Priscilla and Aquila made use of the privilege they had with Paul. The Act of the Apostle shows that Priscilla was the source of inspiration for her husband's commitment to the gospel work with Paul. Priscilla's name was given higher priority over her husband's name three times in the scriptures under Paul's ministry. Theologians reasoned that Pricilla's name was more pronounced in the scriptures than her husband's to indicate the higher grace and commitment in her.     **\n\n Second Timothy 4 verse 19     **\n\n “Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.”     **\n\n\n2.2.\tPriscilla Was Steadfast with Paul to the End \n\nPriscilla and Aquila continued to work with Paul, until the last day of his ministry work on earth.    **\n\n\n Second Timothy 4 verse 6 to 8 ,16 to 19    **\n\n“For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.\n\nI have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith \n\nHenceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day \nand not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.\n\n  At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me  I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.\n\n Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear  and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.\n\n And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto His heavenly kingdom  to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.\n\n Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.”     **\n\nPaul knew that his service in the gospel work was coming to an end and he was prepared to meet Jesus Christ in heaven. The scripture reference above equally shows Priscilla's steadfastness with her husband in support of the gospel work with Paul to the end. Holy women should stand steadfast in the gospel work with their husbands to the end. In other words, women should be inspirers of their husbands in the gospel work as did Priscilla. There should be no backsliding until death or rapture. God has put grace in your life to support your husband in the ministry work. Be faithful to God and your husband.    **\n\nFirst Peter 3 verse 5 to 6    **\n\n“ For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands\n\nEven as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord  whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.”    **\n\n\nA story was told of a faithful woman whose husband was arrested for preaching the gospel of Christ in a communist country. The threat from the communist government did not prevent her from supporting her husband to the end. The husband was taken to prison and judgment was passed on him to deny Jesus or face a death sentence. As this was going on, the woman requested to see her husband in prison. The woman stood as an inspirer to her husband and ensured he did not deny Jesus for any reason.    **\n\nShe was ready for widowhood for Christ's sake. She inspired her husband not to deny Jesus in the prison, but to resist the devil to the end. As the Lord would have it, the woman was allowed to see her husband in the prison by the communist government. She was allowed to visit the prison in the hope of persuading her husband to deny Jesus. When she entered the prison, she met her husband and encouraged him not to deny Jesus in spite of the death penalty hanging on his neck. When the government officials noticed that she was rather encouraging her husband to remain firm in his conviction for Christ, they threatened to execute her along with her husband. She told them that was good news because it would give her the rare privilege of dying the same day with her husband and being forever with their blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in heaven. All persuasions to convince them to deny Jesus failed.    **\n\nMay such a spirit of steadfast and unfailing faith that will make you to stand for Jesus at the risk of your life come upon you. This was how Priscilla and Aquila remained steadfast to the end. Note that the Bible says nothing about their children. We do not know whether they had children or not. What was most important of them and worthy of eternal mention was their faithful Christian life and ministry.   **\n\nRomans 8 verse 35 to 39   **\n\n“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? \n\nAs it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. \n\nNay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. \n\nFor I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, \n\n\nNor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”    **\n\n2.3. Priscilla Patterned Her Life After Paul,\n\nHer Mentor    **\n\nPriscilla knew the discipline of Paul's ministry and also understood the truth of the gospel. She followed the pattern of Paul in ministry and endured the sufferings attached to the gospel.    **\n\nPhilippians 4 verse 9     **\n\n“Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do  and the God of peace shall be with you.”     **\n\nPriscilla was a preacher and teacher of sound doctrine. She preached the full gospel  salvation from sin, sanctification of heart, baptism with the Holy Spirit, evidenced by speaking in tongues. She taught restitution  correcting past wrong doing; she taught standard Christian marriage, one man, one wife till death of either party, tithe payment, righteousness, holiness and truth in business and in human relationship. As a passionate soul winner, she persuaded believers to win souls for Christ and be ready for Christ’s return. Being an example herself she taught wives’ submission to their own husbands in everything and husbands love for their wives, parent’s care for children and children's obedience to their parents. She learned these and other gospel truth from Paul her mentor.   **\n\n\n\nTitus 2 verse 1   **\n\n“ But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine ”\n\n\n First Timothy 4 verse 15 and 16   **\n\n“Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.\n\n Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them  for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.”   **\n\nWomen who have learned and are learning the doctrine and discipline of truth, righteousness and holiness should spread same in their society and in the world\n\nMany of the people at that time were new converts in Christ. They never knew the truth of the gospel. But Priscilla was a true disciple of Paul in life and doctrine. She practiced the constant life of righteousness and holiness as a Christian and holiness preacher. She dressed holy. She did not use jewelry to adore herself nor engaged in fanciful hairdo.   **\n\n First Thessalonians 2 verse10   **\n\n“ Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe ”    **\n\nSecond Timothy 1 verse 13 to15    **\n \n“ Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.\n\n That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.\n\nThis thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.”\n\nPaul was a practical example of a true minister of God. Priscilla emulated Paul's example in reaching out to perishing souls. She was zealous for Jesus and learned much revelation of truth from Paul.   **\n\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 2    **\n\n“ And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.”    **\n\nThe doctrines and practices you have learned from true Christian ministers should be passed onward to others.  **\n \nCHAPTER THREE      **\n\nPRISCILLA BECAME A MENTOR HERSELF   **\n\n3.1 Priscilla Mentored Apollos   **\n\nPriscilla and Aquila came across Apollos who did not have full knowledge of the gospel message. Apollos only knew about the baptism of John. They reached out to perfect him in Christ.   **\n\nActs 18 verse 24 to 28    **\n\n“ And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.\n\nThis man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.\n\n And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.\n\n And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him  who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace\n For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.”   **\n\nApollos spoke well of Christ but knew little of the truth of the gospel. He was a zealous man but lacked adequate knowledge of the message of the gospel. Priscilla and Aquila found Apollos as a potential material for the gospel work. They took him aside and tutored him to make him understand the gospel truth clearly. Apollos was a humble man. He did not resist the mentorship of a woman. This made Apollos to become a great preacher of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.   **\n\nActs 19 verse 1 to 4   **\n\n“And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus and finding certain disciples,\n\n He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.\n\nAnd he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism.\n\n Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on Him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.”    **\n\n\nThe scriptures above revealed Apollos' limited knowledge about Christ before meeting Aquila and Priscilla. He had little or no knowledge of Christ as the Lord and personal Saviour of all mankind. Moreover, he had little or no knowledge about the Holy Spirit baptism. He spoke and quoted scriptures about Christ but had little practical knowledge of Him. This means Apollos didn't know Christ as his Lord and personal Saviour. Priscilla and Aquila recognized that Apollos could preach but still had deep ignorance in him. From their view, they knew such inadequacy could make Apollos lead others astray from the true gospel of Christ. One key lesson to learn from this is that you may know how to preach to attract others’ attention, but you still need true mentorship in order to be effective in gospel work. We encourage you to get the messages, books and gospel materials of Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide to perfect your knowledge of Jesus Christ and His holy word and ways   **\n\nLuke 1 verse1 to 4    **\n\n“Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, \n\n\nEven as they delivered them unto us, \n\nwhich from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;\n\n\n It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,\n\n\n That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.”     **\n\n\n3.2\tApollos' Humble Submission to Priscilla's Mentorship    **\n\n\nJames 4 verse 6   **\n\n“ But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.”\n\n First Peter 5 verse 5 and 6   **\n\n“Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility  for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. \n\nHumble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time ”    **\n\nIt requires humility to yield to true mentorship in the gospel work as did Apollos. One of the signs of spiritual bankruptcy today is the lack of humility in many Christians, which makes them rebuff mentorship in the gospel work. Many are not willing to learn from true ministers of the gospel. The reason for this may be because of age difference, denominational differences, ministerial seniority, doctrinal ignorance that denies submission to a woman in things of God.    **\n\nA story was told of a king who was very tough. He was so tough and pompous that his servants found it practically difficult to correct him on anything. One day, he was having a running stomach when going for a meeting with his servant. He had to use the toilet before going for the meeting. However, he did not know that after visiting the toilet part of his flowing regalia had patches of excreta on it. His servant noticed the mess as soon as he came out of the toilet, but he was afraid to inform the proud king. The king walked majestically into the hall of meeting unaware that he was accompanied by his excreta and its offensive look. It was a great public embarrassment when he was informed by the audience of the excreta on his dress.    **\n\nFrom this story we learn that pride and arrogance bring shame and disgrace. Therefore, be meek and humble and be willing to receive correction and reproof from others for your wisdom, excellence and perfection.    **\n\nMatthew 11 verse 28 to 30   **\n\n“Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n\n Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n\n For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.”    **\n\nIf you are proud, people will leave you with your mistakes to the detriment of your soul. Apollos was a humble man hence he benefited in many ways from the fruit of his humility. You may be a good servant of Jesus, but there may still be some ignorance in your life. You may be preaching very well but still have some errors polluting your message. Some of these preachers just need a second touch from Jesus in order to be effective preachers of the gospel. Apollos became an effective preacher after the mentorship of Priscilla and her husband.     **\n\n3.3.\tAge Is Not a Determining Factor in Mentorship    **\n\n\nGalatians 1 verse 15 to 16    **\n\n“But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by His grace,\n\nTo reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the heathen ; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood”   **\n\nEphesians 3 verse1 to 4, verse 7 and 8     **\n\n“For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,\n\n If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward;\n\n How that by revelation He made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,\n\n\n Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)\n\n\nWhereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of His power.\n\n Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.”    **\n\nAquila and Priscilla were led by God to be mentored by Paul, the apostle, a man renowned for righteousness, holiness, the knowledge of God and revelations of Jesus Christ. Paul was a man of God, called to be a teacher of the gospel and endued with the gifts of the Holy Spirit.   **\n\nWhat a privilege it is to serve the Lord under such a man of God! Apostle Peter acknowledged the wisdom of Paul and humbled himself to read the writings of Apostle Paul which he called scriptures.   **\n\n Second Peter 3 verse15 to 16    **\n\n“ And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;\n\n As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.”    **\n\n\nWe are not serving in a military barrack where we expect to be promoted according to the period of service. Paul said he was the least of all the apostles yet the Lord used him to do great exploits for Him. He wrote a lot of mysteries and truths that required prayers to be able to understand them. These show that age difference does not matter in the sight of God. God gave Paul the revelations of the gospel of Christ. Paul did great exploits for the Lord regardless of the fact that he came to know Christ after the other apostles.    **\n\n\n3.4 You May Need a Second Touch Through Mentorship   **\n\n\nSecond Corinthians 12 verse 7    **\n\n“ And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.”    **\n\nI admonish you to obey the teachings of Holiness Revival Movement, full of truth, power, wisdom and holiness. It is God's ministry for this end time. Do the assignments given to you by this ministry. Do not busy yourself with things of this world to the hurt of your soul. Stop your unworthy excuses and listen to the inspired messages of this ministry. The messages are made available to you through DVDs, CDs, books, magazines, tracts and other materials. These messages are part of the mentorship God desires you to receive in Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide (HEROMOW). They are also available on YouTube. God is using them to prepare you as a vessel of honour. Do not listen to Satan inspired enemies of Holiness Movement who publish lies and evil report against this Movement and her leadership to hinder the salvation of human souls.    **\n\nPriscilla received a second touch from the Lord after being mentored by Paul. There are many “Priscillas” that need to be trained and made to receive a second touch from the Lord. By the same token, there are many “Apollos ministers” who are in wrong marriages, living immoral lives, and ignorant of gospel truth. Such “Apollos ministers” are operating in deep errors and therefore need a second touch from the Lord. Examine yourself if you are in this category of “Apollos ministers” and yield to true mentorship in Christ. Identify with Holiness Movement for proper gospel training in truth, righteousness and holiness for end time exploits.   **\n\nColossians 2 verse 6 to 7      **\n“ As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him;\n\n Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.”    **\n\nTrue mentorship is possible through submission to God's true ministers. It is a blessing, if you have a righteous husband who is a minister of the true gospel. Submit to him. Go with him to change the world. Help the denominational churches to know the true gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Priscilla served the Lord to the end.    ** \n\nWork along with me, Pastor Paul Rika, to promote the Lord Jesus Christ and biblical truth, righteousness, and holiness. Join your husband in HOREMOW to work with me and be the Priscilla of our days in this end time. Make friends with the weak in Christ. Mentor and help them out of ignorance. Go and tell them that Jesus Christ is the Lord. Improve the ministry of Pastors, Evangelists, Prophets, and teachers, as Priscilla did on Apollos. Be significant in the Christian life and ministry!    **\n\nCHAPTER FOUR   **\n\nGOD CAN USE A WOMAN TO TEACH, PREACH AND PROPHESY    **\n\nThere was a woman in Israel who brought revival to the nation, recovered them from  backsliding and delivered them from the hand of their enemies. Her name was Deborah.    **\n\nJudges 4 verse 1 to 5    **\n\n“And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead. \n\nAnd the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. \n\nAnd the children of Israel cried unto the LORD; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. \n\nAnd Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. \n\nAnd she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment”    **\n\n4.1. Sin Gives The Enemy The Upper Hand    **\n\nIt was very common that Israel would go into sin and idolatry before the Lord and lose His presence and relationship. This happened over and over again. Whenever it happened, the Lord would allow their enemies to punish or oppress them and when they cried unto the Lord, He would send them a national leader called a judge, to deliver them. On this occasion, when they sinned again against Him He sold them to Jabin, the king of Canaan who cruelly oppressed them for twenty years. The lesson to learn from this vicious cycle of oppression of Israel is that sin strengthens the hands of the enemy against the sinful person.    **\n\nProverbs 26 verse 2      **\n\n“As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.”    **\n\n\nCheck yourself when you begin to see some hard things coming your way. It could be that you have left the Lord and the Lord has allowed Satan to take over and oppress you. It was like that with the children of Israel. When they left the Lord, the Lord would allow them to dance\ninto the hand of their enemies, until they repented and cried unto Him. Then He would send them a leader, someone that would redeem them from their situation. If that be the case with you, you know the reason why you are passing through frustration, you know why the hand of the Lord is heavy upon your life, then you need to repent. Stop that sin, turn back to the Lord and cry to Him to give you His salvation.     **\n\nIsaiah 55 verse 6 to 7     **\n\n“Seek ye the LORD while He may be found, call ye upon Him while he is near;\n\n Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts  and let him return unto the LORD, and He will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon”.     **\n\n4.2\tGod Can Use a Man or Woman     **\n\nJabin the king of Canaan oppressed Israel for twenty years. When they cried to the Lord, He gave them Deborah to deliver them. It looked out of order that the children of Israel should be led by a woman. If you look at the way the writer wrote it, his expression was with emphasis. He wanted people to know that the leader was indeed a woman. In verse 4 it says, “And Deborah;” that is a feminine word. “A prophetess,” another feminine word. Still talking about Deborah, “the wife of Lapidoth;” yet another feminine word. “She judged Israel at that time;” the fourth feminine description. All to emphasize the feminine character of the person being talked about. Do you really know how it happened that the Israelites came to the point that a woman, Deborah, became their judge? God wanted to show His sovereignty over His human creature?. He can use whom He wills. God did this to humble man in his pride and disdain over the woman. God is saying, I use whomever I will.    **\n\nRomans 9 verse 15     **\n“ For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.”     **\n\n\nDo not think I God follow stereotyped formulas? You may see me following formulas some times, but if you follow formulas continuously, you may not find me there.    **\n\nJohn 3 verse 8    **\n\n“The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.”    **\n\n\nGod raised Deborah up at this time to lead the nation Israel as a prophetess and judge. A woman taking the lead over men was not out of place for God up to this day. Let men make provision for their wives in divine call to service. God can choose you woman to do special service for Him. Let not your husband say, 'Why not him instead? As a sovereign Being, God does not have an adviser or instructor. Make provision, oh church, for women ministry; for God can choose to use them. God can choose to use a woman in any aspect of church work according to His wisdom. Let not the Church say, “Ah! It is out of order for the woman to be a pastor.” Out of order? Well, do you want God to follow your order or His word? Although God sets order, yes, but His orders are known to Him. He can make a woman the pastor over a church. You mean Deborah, the wife of Lapidoth, was not a pastor over Israel? Many misinterpret portions of scriptures to confuse their followers. You must compare scriptures with scriptures to understand God's truth   **\n\nJeremiah 3 verse15    **\n\n“And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.”    **\n\nJudges 4 verse 4 and 5    **\n\n“And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.\n\nAnd she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim  and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.”      **\n\nThat is the sovereignty of God. In case you say,“No! I will not listen to her; I will not listen to a woman.” The Bible says,    **\n\nMatthew 10 verse 40    **\n\n“He that receiveth you receiveth Me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent Me.” So learn humility. O man, learn it!    **\n\n4.3.\tA Woman Prophesying Involves Speaking to Men    **\n\n\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 5 and 13    **\n\n But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head; for that is even all one as if she were shaven.\n\n Judge in yourselves  is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?     **\n\nA woman can be chosen to teach on any subject. Some Pharisees may object this saying, “It will never be, it is out of order. In fact the Bible says in   **\n\n First Timothy 2 verse 11 to 12    **\n\n“Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.”      **\n\nYou are even quoting scriptures, just to put these women out of ministry. The Lord will ask you to go back to the scriptures and then compare scriptures with scriptures. “Did I God say a woman can prophecy in the church? If so, by saying a woman should be in silence does it mean she should not prophesy? Am I not the one that said when she is prophesying she should cover her head? If so, why are you taking My word out of context, saying the Lord has instructed that she should be silent? Didn't you compare scriptures with scriptures? Is prophesying a silent business? Do you prophesy in your heart? Will people hear you? No! Again, did I not tell you that Philip the evangelist had four daughters that prophesied? By the way, what is prophecy? When I say the woman should prophesy, is it not according to My plan?”     **\n\nJoel 2 verse 28    **\n\n“And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy----.”    **\n\nWhat do I mean by that? 1Corinthians14 verse 3 says, 'But he that prophesieth speaketh…' He that prophesies does what? Speaks! But you are saying she should be silent. That is why you must learn how to interpret scriptures. Yes! For the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life,2 Corinthians. 3 verse 6. “Would I God tell her to prophesy and then ban her from speaking completely? I will not do that.”    **\n \nIsaiah 66 verse 9     **\n\n“Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD; shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy God.”    **\n\n\nThat is God asking you a question. “He that prophesies speaks unto men.” First Corinthians 14 verse 3.Then, why are you saying she should not speak to men?    **\n\nGod says, he that has a word of prophecy should speak unto men. 'Men' is a generic word here. Mariam was a prophetess; she spoke to men as well as to the women. Deborah, the prophetess, spoke to men as well as to women. So also the daughters of God should speak to women and to men as well. And what should they say to men?\n\nBut he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.1Corinthians. 14 verse 3. The Bible tells us the word of God is the sure word of prophecy.    **\n\n Second Peter 1 verse 19 to 21   **\n\n“ We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark\nplace, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts \n\n Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.    **\n\n For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.”     **\n\nYou know quite well that the prophecies of old time recorded in the scripture were given by both men and women. The same thing is true of the prophecies of the New Testament. Therefore, the woman has the right to speak the word of God to men for edification, exhortation and comfort in the church. She has the right to speak the word of God in the church to edify people in the church, to exhort people in the church, which is a mixed congregation of men and women. Because she has been given the word, she has received the sure word of prophecy, she has received inspiration, she has received the calling, she must speak the word to the audience, that the church may obey the Lord.   **\n\nActs 26 verse 16 to 18     **\n\n“But rise, and stand upon thy feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;\n\n\n Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,\n\n To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in Me.”      **\n\n\n4.4. The Woman Can Both Preach and Teach   **\n\nSome say the Bible says a woman can preach but not teach. They do not have the correct understanding of the scripture below   **\n\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 12    **\n\n“But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.”    **\n\nFirst, let me draw attention to the fact that this scripture is written in a general sense and not applicable to any specific occasion. Otherwise it will mean that the woman cannot stand before any group of people in the church or human society at any time to teach them. Now let us compare scriptures with scriptures. What does the scripture mean when it says in Titus 2 verse 3 and 4?\n\n“The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things…”\n\nThe Bible says that they should teach good things. “That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children.” Can you see now? Does “I suffer not a woman to teach nor usurp authority over the man” mean “Leave all teachings to men?” No! The Bible did not say so. Here, the Bible has given her the license to teach “good things.” Salvation is a good thing, heaven is a good thing, and the message of the gospel is a good thing. She should teach others that they may learn good character!     **\n\n\n4.5.\tWomen Must Not Usurp Authority Over Men   **\n\n\nLook back on those scriptures; you will see some traces that caused such instructions to be given.     **\n\nFirst Corinthians 14 verse 33 to 35     **\n\n“ For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.\n\n Let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.\n\nAnd if they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home  for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.”    **\n\nIf you take this literally, you will stop all women from prophesying because you will say, “It is a shame for women to speak in the church.”\n\nYou will stop all their activities. Even the songs that they are singing in the church will be a shame. When women sing in the Church, do you really see it as shame to them? We should learn how to interprete the scripture. When women give testimonies in the church of the grace and goodness of the Lord in their lives, do these bring shame to them or to the church?      **\n\nNow, if you look at this scripture you will see that some women were bringing confusion to the church which explains why the apostle said,\n\n“God is not the author of confusion”. Again the Scripture says that, “They are not permitted to speak, but they are commanded to be under obedience. “Some women were disobedient in the church; that was why the law came to control such disobedient ones. And the Scripture also says in     **\n\n\nFirst Corinthians 14 verse 35,   **\n\n“If they will ask anything, let them ask their husband at home, for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.” It means these disobedient women are causing shame in the church. No righteous woman will cause shame in the church. No holy woman will cause shame in the church. It is the unruly and disobedient women that cause shame, and in that case, they must be controlled. The leaders are to limit their liberty in the church to ensure the peace of the church. God is the author of peace.    **\n\nAlso, some women were exercising carnal authority over their husbands and other men. They were carnal, not God-led or God-inspired. By their use of carnal authority over the men, they highjacked power from them. That was why Paul said that such women should be controlled because they are bringing confusion to the church.     **\n\n First Timothy 2 verse 12 to 14    **\n\n“But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. For Adam was first formed, then Eve. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.”    ** \n\nCan you see that? I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp(or highjack authority or power from men). The action “teach” above is not something done in righteousness and by divine inspiration, but something done forcefully and wrongfully in carnality. It shows that she is using carnal authority and false zeal to highjack control from the men. She is forward; and is using her natural property as a woman to forcefully lead the men. That is dangerous! For Adam was not in the transgression. It was the forwardness of Eve that gave chance to Satan to bring collapse to their\nrelationship with God in the garden of Eden.    **\n\nConsequently, if you allow a woman to employ her carnal emotions and feminine powers to take the lead over men, the church system will collapse. Therefore, such carnal ones must be kept silent and put under subjection. Adam was first formed, so why is she usurping authority over the man? As we can see, it is the unholy women that caused these commandments to come up, not the holy women, not the righteous women, not the women led by the Spirit of God. Hence, this rule does not apply where the woman concerned is born again and is holy, being called by God and inspired by the Holy Spirit in Christian service as Deborah was.     **\n\n First Timothy 1 verse 9 to 11    **\n\n“Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, \n\n\nFor whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for men stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;\n\n According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.”    **\n   \n\nTherefore, the law made in the church against women is not for the righteous and holy, but to control the disobedient and the ungodly ones among them. The scriptures open a full door of service to the woman. She is a helpmate for man in the secular world, in the family circle, in the church and also in spiritual matters. The Lord has made her a helper to assist the man in the activities he is doing, so that the work can be done well and very quickly. So she has a good role to play in the church and in Christian ministry.     **\n\nNow woman, God has put off the obstacles which have limited you in the Lord. Satan knows about the soon-coming of Christ and wants to deprive the Lord of His labourers. He did this through tradition of men and mis-interpretation of scriptures. Now that the truth has been revealed, let the woman go full blast in her service to the Lord, according to her divine calling without any limitations.    **\n \nColossians 2 verse 8 and 10     **\n\n “Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.\n\n And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power ”     **\n\n\n4.6. A Door of Service Is Fully Opened for Women\n\nI have loved thee   **\n\nRevelation 3 verse 7 to 9    **\n\n“And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These things saith He that is holy, He that is true, He that hath the key of David, He that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth;\n\n\n I know thy works  behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept My word, and hast not denied My name.\n\n Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that.”  ** \n\nGod's ways are not man's ways; God's thoughts are not man's thoughts. Deborah, the wife of Lapidoth, was the leader of Israel at that time. Deborah the wife of Lapidoth brought revival to Israel at that time. She also judged Israel in matters of righteousness at that time. Hallelujah! That is what God wants us all to know. He is the sovereign God. Both married and single Christian women should accept divine call and go for end-time exploits for Jesus Christ.   **\n\n4.7.\tLet The Women Behave Righteously to Their Husbands    **\n\nYou will notice in scripture that Deborah had no crisis with her husband. She did not have marital or family problem. This is because she discharged her marital obligations to her husband faithfully. She loved him, submitted to him and reverenced him. Her husband was not neglected or despised because of her ministry.   **\n\nTitus 2 verse 3 to 5    **\n\n“The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false\naccusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;\n\nThat they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,\n\n To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.”   **\n\nChristian woman, to prosper in your ministry and to qualify for reward from the Lord requires holiness of life and character, which shows up in good behavior towards your husband. The most important thing in your life is not anointed Christian service, but holy Christian character. Therefore, treat your husband and household well.     **\n\n First Peter 3 verse 1 to 6    **\n\n“Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;\n\nWhile they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.\n\nWhose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;\n\n But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\n\n For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands \n\nEven as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord  whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement”.     **\n\n\nRemember to obey God and exalt Him above your husband in matters of your Christian life and ministry. Be ready to suffer under an unbelieving and difficult husband who is resisting your Christian life and commitment to the ministry. Do not mind being cast out of the marriage because of Jesus and His work.    **\n  \n\nFirst Peter 4 verse 12 to 16   **\n  \n“Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you \n\n But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.\n\n If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you  on their part He is evil spoken of, but on your part He is glorified.\n\n\n But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.\n\nYet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.”     **\n\n\nMatthew 10 verse 33 to 39     **\n \n“ But whosoever shall deny Me before men, him will I also deny before My Father which is in heaven.\n\n Think not that I am come to send peace on earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword.\n\nFor I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.\n\n And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.\n\nHe that loveth father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me  and he that loveth son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.\n\n\n And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after Me, is not worthy of Me.\n\n He that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for My sake shall find it.”   **\n\n\nBe humble and obedient, be bold, courageous and wise. Do you allow your husband or marriage to destroy your soul.\n\nThe submission of your husband to God is required for your full submission to him. To submit to his ungodly rule is to exalt him above God and make him your idol!   **\n\nJames 1 verse 2 to 8     **\n\n “My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;\n\n Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.\n\nBut let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.\n\n\n If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.\n\nFor let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.\n\nA double minded man is unstable in all his ways.”    **\n\nCHAPTER FIVE   **\n\nDEBORAH WAS A COURAGEOUS WOMAN AND HANDY VESSEL IN THE HANDS OF GOD   **\n\nAnother reason why Deborah came handy for divine assignment was because no man was courageous enough to take the lead to deliver the people from the hands of their oppressors. The hearts of all the men melted before their enemies. This made God to turn to a woman for the revival of His people.    **\n\nJudges 5 verse 1 to 2 ,6 to 7    **\n\n“Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,\n\nIn the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.\n\n The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.”   **\n\n“Until that I Deborah arose.” Was she proud? No, she was not proud. She was revealing to us that God can use women for His work, even as He uses men. Hence women should be prepared for God's service in any capacity according to His will and calling, even though the Bible recognizes them as weaker vessels.    **\n\n5.1\tWomen Are Not Weak in The Hands of God    **\n\n\n First Peter 3 verse 7    **\n\n“Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.”    **\n\nPeople are taking this phrase 'As unto the weaker vessel' too far. They are using this statement to despise the women. They are making it to look like women cannot preach, cannot pastor, cannot minister to the spiritual needs of brethren in the church. But God in His wisdom contradicts such masculine biases and chose to use Deborah in her time to take the lead over men!          **      \n\nFirst Corinthians.1 verse 27 to 31    **\n\n“But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;\n\n And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are;\n\n That no flesh should glory in His presence.\n\n\n But of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption;\n\n That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.”    **\n\n\n5.2 God Can Use a Weak Vessel to Confound the Strong     **\n\n\nImagine what Deborah achieved in her time when the men were afraid, when the men ran away, and when the men were asleep. Is our time not similar to Deborah's time? When you look at the churches today, do you not see the era of Deborah playing out again? Are you not seeing Deborah's time replicated in our time? When you look at the society, what do you see? Are you not seeing the same problem? When you enter the church on worship day, look round and see the ratio of men to women. Is that not a proof that the days of Deborah are here? Is that not a proof that the men are afraid, that the men are away from God, that the men are asleep in sin? It is when people go to sleep that the enemies do their work.         **          \n\nMatthew 13 verse 25 to 27    **\n\n“But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. \n\nSo the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? \n\nWhen men fall asleep, the enemies go to do evil. So God is now saying, By the way, is it only men I created? I created women also and if the men have become afraid, I will raise up the women.”    **\n\n\nDid He not say in Luke 19 verse 40, “I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out?”\n\nEven stones! Woman, transformation is coming into your life! The God of heaven will raise you up for His name and people shall hear your revival story.\n\nWhen the Lord told Moses to tell the people of Israel they would eat flesh, Moses replied      **\n\nNumbers 11 verse 21 to 22     **\n\n“The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and Thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.\n\nShall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?\n\n And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD'S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.”    **\n\nLet nobody doubt what God will use women to do in this end time by the Holy Ghost. God, the creator of the women, is the one talking. God's call on women is what I am bringing to your knowledge. I am telling the women to rise up to this calling of God because most men in the local churches have gone into captivity to sin and Satan.    **  \n\n\n5.3. Many Churches No More Bother About Heaven Or Hell  **                    \n\nThere is no more fear of God in many churches. In some local churches, the pastors and church elders engage themselves in physical combat. Have you witnessed or heard of that before? The abomination has gone far; no fear of God in the churches. They do not believe in Jesus any more. The preachers themselves are unbelievers. Bishops and pastors concoct plans together to kill a messenger Jesus sends with the message of righteousness, holiness and truth.      **        \n\nLuke 12 verse 15 to 21    **\n\n“ And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.\n And He spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully;\n\n And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?\n\n And he said, This will I do  I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.\n\nAnd I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.\n\n But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee  then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?\n\n So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”   **\n\nHeaven is no more the priority of most churches. I heard that a particular Bishop invited people to fantastic mansion he built which was described as “heaven on earth.” As he showed them round he said, “This is why I don't think of going to heaven now. How can I have all these things and be thinking of going to heaven now?” Exactly! They are not thinking of going to heaven. They have enough wealth that Satan has given them. Satan has told them, “All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.”(Matthew 4 verse 9).\n\nThey have “arrived,” so they are not thinking of heaven anymore.  **\n\nAlso, they are not conscious of the possibility of going to hell either. This is the situation of many church leaders, pastors and members. If you go and tell them, “This thing will take you to hell fire. Stop it.” They will laugh and tell you “Who are you to judge another man's servant? Bible says, 'Judge not!'” I was told of one of the brothers in Holiness Movement some years ago who attends one of these prosperity churches. He took the message of hell fire to the little children and taught them on the eternal consequences of sin. He warned them against sinful behaviors, which would take them to hell. The children began to ask, “Uncle, hell fire? Where is it?” This is because they were worshiping in a church where hell fire was never preached or taught.   **                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nA man who attends that church called me and said, “For eleven years that I have been in this church, I have never heard any message on the return of Jesus. No! I have never heard it preached in the church. It was one guest preacher from somewhere that told us Jesus is coming back soon. “That is the situation of many churches. They are completely lost! They are not aware of hell and are not bothered about it. In fact, it is not in their heart to preach or live by the true word of God. What they preach is human science and philosophy. How to get rich, and how to live in peace, and make progress. They use enticing words of man's wisdom.   **\n\nColossians 2 verse 8     **\n\nBeware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.    **\n\nThey are preaching about generation curse, going to people's houses to deliver them from generation curse; showing that their belief in Jesus is not enough. They say, “Your great grandfather, who died 100 years ago, had a contract with Satan and in fact if you do not go for this generation curse deliverance…., in fact, it is the reason why you are not married. “They corrupt believers through preaching the “gospel according to money.” They make people pay a lot for deliverance prayer and for everything they desire from God.   **\n \nFirst Timothy 6 verse 7 to 11   **\n\n7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.\n\n8 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.\n\n9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.\n\n10 For the love of money is the root of all evil  which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.\n\n11 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.   **\n\n\n5.4\tHypocrisy and Deceit in the Church    **\n\nHow many churches are free from hypocrisy and deceit? Things are buried in their altar to manipulate members. It reminds me of the story of a man I heard lives in South Africa. He wired a corner of his sitting room with concealed open electric cable that gives mild electric shock to anyone that comes around the place. Anytime people come to him to be baptized in the Holy Ghost, he invite's them to his house for special prayers and tells them, “It is a simple thing to receive Holy Ghost Baptism. Just move to that corner and begin to pray for Holy Ghost baptism.” While the prayer is on, he goes inside and switches on the power of the concealed wire and as soon as they begin to experience mild electric shocks he says, “Yes, that is the Holy Ghost?. Speak any illegible words. That is the Holy Ghost baptism.”\n\nHoly Ghost? I am telling you, this people have gone far. That is why you see sinners speaking in “tongues” now. They don't know Jesus and yet they are speaking in tongues. Righteousness is not in their church, yet they are speaking in tongues. Where did they get it from? “Holy Ghost” electricity! That is what is going on now. Satanism and witchcraft have taken over. Youths and children are in great danger of witchcraft initiation in the church!   **\n\nActs 8 verse 9 to 11  **\n \n9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one \n\n\n10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.\n\n11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.     **\n\nGod has given us more time to work and get things done very quickly. The few righteous ones are passing through great oppression and persecution. Husbands have been told to torture their believing wives to ensure all this holiness and righteousness does not continue. Infact, in one of the churches in Plateau State, Nigeria, during their holy communion service they announced, “All women that have removed their earrings should put them on, otherwise, they will not partake in this holy communion. “What a practical battle against holiness!   **\n\n\n\nMany Pastors and Elders Do Not Know Jesus     **\n\nJeremiah 2 verse 8   **\n\n8 The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew Me not; the pastors also transgressed against Me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.     **\n\nThe pastors and elders do not know the Lord nor His ways. The power they are working with is satanic power, and they are evangelizing one another, taking themselves to the beach to meet mermaid spirits. The more converts a pastor takes to Satan to receive demonic power, the greater he becomes in Satanism.    **\n\nThe Lord gave a revelation of one of these great churches. The church is divided into two during service. One side of the building is dedicated to the worship of God while occultism goes on at the other side. The building has underground apartment. The pastor shuttles from one side to the other leading activities!    **\n\nMatthew 15 verse 7 to 9    **\n\n“Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,\n\nThis people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth, and honoureth Me with their lips; but their heart is far from Me.   **\n\nBut in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of me”.  **\n\nThe revelation showed one of the members saying, “You know what is happening is that, going to the witch doctor is a public thing and it is causing people shame. As a result, witch doctor business has now moved to the church. We come as worshippers in the church, but move to the occult side. Some in that same church are not aware.”  **\n\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 22    **\n\n“Flee also youthful lusts; but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.”      **\n\n\nThat is what is going on in many of these churches. In that church, some are worshiping, thinking they are worshiping God. Can God be in that place? The Bible says, can Satan and Jesus be in the same temple?   **\n\n Second Corinthians 6 verse 14 to18     **\n\n“ Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?\n\n And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?\n\n\nAnd what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.\n\n Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,\n\n And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.”      **\n\nBut many of the churches are like sheep that have no shepherd. God is now calling on women, because the men are gone, they have been overtaken, they have become very few in His presence. Elijah thought he was the only prophet of God left, but the Lord told him there were 7000 more. But how many were 7000 in the whole nation of Israel? So that is the case now. The righteous in Christ are too few!    **\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX    **\n\nWOMAN! GOD WANTS TO USE YOU   **\n\nwoman, do not let the tradition of men hinder you. Accept God's call and arise for His work.     **\n \nExodus 3 verse 2 to 10    **\n\n“And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. \n\n\nAnd Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. \n\n\nAnd when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. \n\nAnd He said, Draw not nigh hither  put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. \n\nMoreover He said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.\n\n And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of My people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;\n\n8 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.\n\n\n Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto Me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.\n\n Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth My people the children of Israel out of Egypt.\n\nHere, God is addressing His faithful daughters saying, “You have heard and even seen it yourself; you know the oppression of the devil and his demons against My people. You know the hardship that Satan has put the people into and now they are crying to Me. They are sighing for salvation day and night. Come now My daughter, and I will send you to the gospel field to bring these people from sin and Satan unto eternal life in Christ.”   *\n\nIsaiah 6 verse 8    **\n\n Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.”    **\n\n\n6.1\tDeceptive Worship in Some Churches     **\n\nSomebody told me the story of a youth who belonged to one of these evil churches. He was told by his pastor, “We are taking you to our headquarters in Abuja.” The boy journeyed to Abuja happily along with other people and came into the headquarters building. I told you earlier that, that kind of church is divided into two. The church had a section where people were kept for sacrifice. The boy found himself in that section. He did not know that he had been brought for sacrifice. Then a man of his own tribe, who was one of the hit men of the church noticed from the boy's accent that he was from his tribe. Because of that tribal connection, he felt compelled to save the boy. So he disclosed to the boy, “You are here to be sacrificed.” Alarmed, the boy exclaimed, “Eh!” The man repeated, “Yes, you are here to be sacrificed.” Meanwhile, worship was going on at one side of the building and sacrifice at the other side. Can a spring of water bring out sweet water and bitter water at the same time?   **\n\nJames 3 verse11    **\n\n11 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?   **\n\nParadoxically, that is what is going on in many churches now. There is a camouflage hiding many terrible things going on underneath. So the man showed the boy the way of escape.\n\nI have seen the affliction of My people that are in Egypt and I know their sorrows. That is God talking to His daughters. “I have seen the affliction of your brethren and I know how their tax-master pastors are oppressing them. Therefore, I have come down to deliver them; I have heard their cry, their groaning.”\n\nWhen a cow is being slaughtered, do you know how it groans? How much more when a human being is being slaughtered and offered to Satan as sacrifice to make the church progress! I have seen the groaning of My people! Come now therefore, I will send you to Pharaoh and ye shall bring forth My people from Egypt. That is what the Lord is telling you, woman.     **\n\n6.2.\tGod Gives Full Backing to Women in Ministry     **\n\nWhen God told Moses, “Come and I will send you to Pharaoh,” Moses response was, “Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh to bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?”    **\n\nSimilarly, God is now saying to women, “I have removed that tradition out of your way. The tradition that makes you say “Who am I? I am just a woman?” The Lord has removed that tradition. He has shown you Deborah as an example. He used Deborah when the men were afraid, when the men were away from Him, when the men were asleep. When Moses said, “Who am I” what was God's response?     **\n\n\n\nExodus 3 verse 11 to12   **\n\n“ And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?\n\n\nAnd he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.”   **\n\nYour ministry shall prosper. You will lead the people out. You will be surprised of the crowd you shall lead out and they will come and serve God in the mountain of HOLINESS. God says, I will be with you; I, your God, will bless your ministry. Amen.     **\n\nExodus 3 verse13 to17     **\n\n“ And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is His name? what shall I say unto them?\n\n\nAnd God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM  and He said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.\n\n\nAnd God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you  this is My name for ever, and this is My memorial unto all generations.\n\n Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt \n\n And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.”    **\n\nDaughter of the Most-High God, the Lord is saying this to you, “Go and tell them, I the Lord Jesus, the Lord of the church, have come for end time revival. I have seen how My people have been deceived, and locked up under the powers of Bishops, Overseers, Superintendents; and the powers of Satan. I have seen how they have been caged in. I have seen how they are passing through all kinds of affliction and how they are suffering from hunger and thirst. Go and tell them that I have come to get them ready for heaven; to take them to a land flowing with milk and honey. I have come to give them eternal life.”     **\n\nJohn 14 verse 2     **\n\n“ In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.”\n\n“I have come to give them mansions in heaven; to prepare them for the rapture that they may make it to heaven. Go and tell them this, and if they ask, 'Who is the authority behind you?' Say to them, 'I AM WHO I AM, the First and the Last, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End is the one backing you up, woman! He is the one sending you! He is the one that will be with you!”    **\n\n\nExodus 3 verse18     **\n\n“And they shall hearken to thy voice  and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.”    **\n\n6.3\tThe Power of God Shall Rest On You    **\n\nGod is saying, “They will believe you. Do not say, ‘I am a common woman.' I will make them believe. I will make them bow to your gospel, and then you and them shall confront those 'Pharaohic forces. ‘You will confront them and say, ‘Let the people of God go free. ‘You will wrestle with them; you will wrestle with principalities and powers; you will wrestle with spiritual wickedness in high places; you will wrestle with the rulers of darkness of this world. The LORD, who is the great God, will be with you.”    **\n\nExodus 3 verse 19 to 20     **\n\nAnd I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. And I will stretch out My hand, and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst thereof  and after that he will let you go.    **\n \n\nWoman, divine power will follow you; signs and wonders will follow you!    **\n\nLuke 10 verse19   **\n\n“Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you.”     **\n\nGod is saying, I know that Satan and his demons will not allow you. However, I will stretch forth My arm of end time judgment over Satan; I will pour down end time powers over Satan and he will allow you go. Those men bound by him will come out of his hand in Jesus name; those women and children under his oppression will come out of his hand in the name of Jesus. That is what the Lord is saying to you, daughter of Christ.    **\n\n\n6.4\tGod promises you His presence     **\n\nDeuteronomy 31 verse 6      **\n\n“Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them  for the LORD thy God, He it is that doth go with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.”     **\n\nGod is going to back you up; he is going to support you with signs and wonders, and this work shall be done. The Lord has promised to go with you and to give you sure success. He has promised to accompany you in ministry and perform His signs and wonders in your ministry. The Lord will convince the people; He is going to make them believe what you shall tell them. God will make Pharaoh to bow to your authority. You shall certainly lead the people out of sin and Satan's hand to the truth, righteousness and holiness of God. They shall worship in the beauty of His holiness. They shall possess the mansions of heaven, in Jesus name. Be courageous, bold and wise.   *\n\n\n6.5\tGod Has Much People to Save      **\n\n\nActs 18 verse 9 to10     **\n“ Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace;\n\nFor I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee  for I have much people in this city.”     **\n\nThe Lord has much people in your nation, much people in your local church, much people in your denominational church to save. The Lord has much people in this end time to bring into His kingdom. Do not be afraid, go for it; nothing will happen to you. Do not fear the police man; do not fear the government; do not fear church authority; do not fear the Sanhedrin; do not fear the Pharisees, and do not fear any man. The God of heaven says, I will be with you. You will succeed in this work! That is what the Lord is saying. Therefore, be bold; I have much people to save, much people to deliver, much people to redeem.      **\n\nTake this commission seriously and pursue it to final execution. Do not allow custom and tradition of men against women to deter you from this call to worldwide revival. Deborah was a woman like you, yet she brought revival to her nation. She was a prophetess; Huldah was a prophetess as well and brought revival to the land of Israel. You too will bring revival to your land, to your nation, to your church and to your community and the world at large. Is it a hard thing? Is it a bad thing?    **\n\nMatthew 9 verse 36 to 38     **\n“ But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.\n\n Then saith He unto His disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;\n\n Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth labourers into His harvest.”     **\n\nThe Lord is sending labourers now. Hallelujah! They are women ministers, they are the Deborah’s of our time, they are taking up the mantle. Come, we are waiting for you, the work is too heavy for us, true preachers are not many. We are too few, we are looking for you. The Lord has called you and given you this book for your encouragement.    **\n\nMark 16 verse15 to 17    **\n\n“And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. \n\n\nHe that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. \n\nAnd these signs shall follow them that believe; In My name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;”    **\n\nWhatever the trap of the enemy, it shall not succeed. The Lord shall go with you. He shall perform signs and wonders in your ministry. The dead shall rise, the blind shall see, the cripple shall rise up and walk, the barren shall give birth to children and the dumb shall speak. Receive power! Go and work for Jesus, go and save the people.   **\n\n\n\nGalatians 1 verse 15 to 16     **\n\n“But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by His grace, \n\nTo reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the heathen ; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood ”   **\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN    **\n\nTHE LORD IS ON HIS WAY COMING    **\n\nRevelation 22 verse 12, 16 and 20    **\n\n“ And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be.\n\n I Jesus have sent Mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.\n\n He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.”     **\n\n\n7.1  This  Generation  Will  Witness  the Coming of the Lord    **\n\nWe are in a crucial time in the history of the world. Something special to God's people and dreadful to sinners is about happening. Maranatha! The Lord is coming! Amen. This shall cease to be a saying that appears to have no meaning. It shall soon be a saying with great meaning; for it is certain that this generation will witness the coming of the Lord face-to-face. We shall not die; we are the generation that shall welcome Jesus in the rapture. And I give you, beloved, rapture greeting because I believe you are among those that shall see the Lord come and shall be transformed. Amen. What grace the Lord has given you, to lay His hand upon you, to take interest in you, to make you one among those He is coming to take up to heaven soon! The righteous ones in the world are praying for His coming. They are saying, “Lord, come quickly.” The saints that are in heaven are also sighing and asking, “Lord, how long will it be before our brethren shall come to join us here?”     **\n\nRevelation 6 verse 9    **\n\n“And when He had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held; And they cried with a loud voice, saying, how long, O Lord, holy and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?”   ** \n\n\n“How long”? They are sighing. “When will you judge the Devil and end up everything?” And in verse 11, “And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.”   **\n\nThere is a sighing in heaven. These scriptures, of course, shall be in the days of tribulation. But even now, our brethren that have gone up to heaven are sighing for us on earth, praying for us to come up to heaven and join them. The word of God confirms the events of our time, showing that they are events indicating the coming of the Lord, and that He will come very soon. Now that the events are being fulfilled rapidly in quick successions in our generation, surely, the Lord is appearing soon. We know by studying the fig tree that this is the time the Lord is coming for His people. The Holy Spirit through revelations and divine visitations has testified this to us. Our dreams and the sighing of our spirit confirm that our time is the rapture time. Now, there is a cloud of witnesses testifying everyday of the rapture. We praise God.    **\n\n\n7.2\tHoliness Revival Movement Worldwide Is Set Up for Rapture    **\n\nWe are preaching with the consciousness that our generation is the generation of Christ's return. I am preaching with the consciousness\nthat I shall not die, but be alive and go with Christ in the rapture. May be the dream the Lord gave me in 1995 will come to pass in this ministry. In the dream I was leading a group of people. I saw demons knelt down with their heads bowed down before us, as we sang triumphantly of the victory of Christ. Suddenly, the rapture took place and we flew up to meet the Lord in the air. This dream might be fulfilled in HOREMOW. Praise the Lord! You, who are not ready, get ready. This revival of truth, righteousness and holiness that you are seeing now shall fill the world. This little thing you are seeing, the little fire that has just been kindled, shall fill the whole world. The Lord Himself is going to do it.     **\n\nFirst Kings 18 verse 41 to 45    **\n\n“ And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.\n\nSo Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees,\n\n And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.\n\n And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.\n\n\nAnd it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.”     **\n\nThe Lord is raising up revivalists to revive the churches to biblical truth, righteousness and holiness before the rapture. For this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the World, then the end will come.     **\n\nHebrews 12 verse14     **\n\n“ Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord ”     **\n\nFirst John 1 verse 3 to 7    **\n\n“That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us  and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.\n\n And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.\n\n This then is the message which we have heard of Him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all.\n\n\nIf we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth \n\nBut if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.”     **\n\n\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 22     **\n\n “Flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.”     **\n\n7.3  Women and the Challenges of the Last Days     **\n\nI thank God for opening a wide door of ministry to women. Woman, the Lord has called you to be part of end time Holiness Ministry. You are to rejoice that by the grace of God you have been called to Holiness Ministry as others. God is going to give us holy men and women and specially prepared Christian materials to train you and put fire in your life, to make you an effective end time revivalist. You must be grateful to the Most High. These are the days of revival. It is revival time for the whole world because the Lord is coming. But then, there is a challenge.   **\n\nLuke 18 verse 8   **\n\n“I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?”     **\n\nThe Lord is coming so quickly, so suddenly, but the world is not informed. The world around you is not conscious that the Lord is coming. Your nation is not conscious; the people in your community are not conscious that the Lord is coming. The governments of the nations are not talking about it because they are not informed. It is not on their agenda that Jesus is coming. This is a terrible ignorance. Do not join them in this ignorance.     **\n\nMatthew 24 verse 36 to 39    **\n\n “But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but My Father only.\n\n But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\n\n For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,\n\n And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.”    **\n\nIn the days of Noah, when Noah was announcing and preaching that the world would be destroyed with water, the people did not bother. They were not even conscious of it. They were eating and drinking, celebrating marriages, doing many projects in the world. They were carefree about their lives, until suddenly, water began to pour down from the sky and spring up from the ground. It was then they became conscious. But the people that heeded the warning were in the ark already. Although the world lies in ignorance, you should be conscious and fully alert of the coming of Jesus. Make sure you remain in the ark. Righteousness and holiness should remain your portion in Jesus name.     **\n\nYour brothers and sisters are ignorant of these things; your mother is ignorant of these things; your father is ignorant of these things; your neighbour is ignorant of these things. This is a sad truth! But thank God, you are not ignorant. May be like Noah you are crying, shouting and preaching to them, but they do not appear to hear. The fact that they despise it does not mean it shall not happen. The Lord shall surely come in our time. Keep yourself pure. When Lot could not gain any body in Sodom, he gained himself. When Lot could not even recover his sons-in-law in Sodom, he was able to recover his family. Although the wife got lost later, he recovered himself and his two daughters. So while you are preaching and telling them this, and they harden their heart or are laughing at you in their foolishness, ensure you retain your righteousness and holiness.     **\nWe see the Lord's coming so near as at the door, but many of our loved ones and acquaintances are not yet in Christ. The situation is just like being in examination hall and everybody is with his or her own writing sheet in readiness for the exam, but here is a precious friend of yours that is not in the hall! The examiner is coming in already with the question papers to share. Alas, this friend of yours has not yet come in. You are wondering, what is happening? Where has she gone to? Why is she not here?      **\n\n\n\n7.4. The Challenge of Backslidden Churches     **\n\nThe Lord is coming; the Lord is already at the door but there is another challenge. It is the challenge of the backslidden church! What they are doing in those churches now have no bearing with the Lord, yet the Lord of the church is coming to take His people home. Where is your mother? In which church has she gotten lost? Where is your brother? Where did he get lost? Where are your children? Why is your husband delaying? Which church has distracted his attention at this crucial time that the Lord is already at the door?     **\n\nLuke 18 verse 7 and 8     **\n\n“And shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them?\n\nI tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?”      **\n\nLook at the Lord coming; look at Him already at the door! Where is the faith of the church in this generation? Shall He find righteousness in the Church? Shall He find holiness in the church?\n\nLord, this issue is painful to the heart of your children. Now, you are coming for the church you founded, about 2000 years ago and it is at this time that there is so much backsliding in our midst. It is at this time that there is corruption everywhere. The churches are into various activities that have no bearing with God. Will you find faith in the world? Not only just a city; the challenge is worldwide. From country to country, the church is backslidden; the church has turned off; the church is busy doing other things! What is going on in the name of worship has no bearing with the holy God. Why are these things so at this crucial time of your coming?     **\nIt is a big challenge. The true faith for righteousness, holiness and heaven is disappearing from the churches. The ministers have gone into error, heresies and covenant with Satan. The few godly ones are under heavy persecutions. The wicked ones are struggling, working hard to make sure they extinguish the fire of the few godly remnants. That is the state of the church. What a big challenge!      **\n\n\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT   **\n\nINCREASING TEMPO OF SATANIC ACTIVITIES ON EARTH   **\n\nSatan is more conscious of the shortness of time than many Christians. He understands the times more than many of us. Satan reads the handwriting and knows the time, so he is working very hard, round the clock. Satan has assigned agents over your life to ensure you do not make it to heaven. He raised people against this Holiness Movement to knock it down right from the beginning, but God did not allow him. He planned many strategies against the Movement and its leadership and since then he has not relented. He is still on the drawing board planning other strategies they are to employ to stop this work, but by God's grace they will continue to fail.    **\n\nEphesian 6 verse 10 to 20    **\n\n“Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. \n\nPut on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. \n\nFor we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.\n\n Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.\n\n\n Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;\n\nAnd your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;\n\nAbove all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. \n\nAnd take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God  \n\nPraying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; \n\nAnd for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel, \n\nFor which I am an ambassador in bonds \nthat therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.”    **\n\nOur faith is in our God. That is why I told the brethren in Holiness Revival Movement not to boast in this matter. It is not a matter of pride, because it is not of man. It is not the name of a ministry that saves, but the grace of God in it; neither is it the kind of leader over the ministry. Don't say, we will make it because of the man God has given us in Holiness Revival Movement. Is it this small me you are boasting about? No it goes beyond that, it is God Himself that we all must trust!    **\n\nI once said that I see myself over Holiness Movement as the third captain of the fifty. The first captain and his fifty men were sent to arrest Elijah when he was on the mountain but it ended up a great disaster.    **\n\nSecond Kings 1 verse 9 and10     **\n\n“Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him  and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.\n\n And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.”    **\n\n\nThe second captain also came with his fifty men but he did not learn his lesson. He too was proud. He thought the matter was in wearing uniform. He thought the matter was in the power of the king, a human being. He came to Elijah and issued his command.    **\n\n Second Kings 1 verse 11 and 12   **\n\n“Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly. \n\nAnd Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.”      **\n\nThe king kept on sending people because he was not the one to die. He sent the third captain and his fifty. The third captain was like myself, or rather, I am like him. He came with humility, nothing to be proud of in this life. Not the uniform he was wearing nor the powers on him as one the king had sent. He came with a different spirit, having learned from group 1 and group 2, who both perished. He adopted a different and humble approach.    **\n\n Second Kings 1 verse 13 to 15    **\n\n“And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. \n\nBehold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties  therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight. \n\nAnd the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him  be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king.”     **\n\n\nCarefulness\n\nI am passing a different spirit into your life, the spirit of carefulness, the spirit of humility. I am putting a contrite spirit into your heart; the Lord will not ignore the contrite ones.\n\nIsaiah 57 verse 15   **\n\n“For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.”     **\n\n Receive humility in your life! That is the spirit of victory; it is the spirit that will take you up to heaven. We need this spirit because the church has  backslidden  round  about  us.  Many holiness churches  that  boasted  of  their holiness  are  now  serving  Satan;  they  have failed. We must operate in a different spirit. I always say, Lord save our lives. Whatever is the wisdom of the devil, whatever is the power of the devil, I the captain of the fifty and my fifty, shall never die. We shall make it in the rapture. There shall be no corruption, no decay in this Holiness Movement until we see you, Lord. With broken spirit, with contrite spirit, with humility, and with full obedience we shall serve you Lord. Satan has lost us forever! Amen.      **\n\nRevelation 12 verse 12     **\n\n“Therefore rejoice ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.”     **\n\nIf you see the eyes of Satan now, it is burning red against Holiness Movement; it is burning red over the leaders and against you that has agreed with and has accepted the holiness message. Satan is boasting  Ah, who are you? I have pulled down many ministers; I have cast down and wounded great churches. I have put them in their corner, who are you? The Lord will answer the devil; He will describe us to the devil. He is in us. In the name of Jesus, the devil shall fall.    **\n\nMy confidence is this  Abraham made it to heaven, Sarah made it to heaven, Joseph made it to heaven, Moses made it to heaven, Paul made it to heaven, Peter made it to heaven, Mary made it to heaven, Timothy made it to heaven, we too will make it to heaven, God will take you there! If the devil had hindered all of them from making heaven, then we will have no hope. If it is just that human beings miss it because of pride, carelessness and the work of the flesh, we will say as the sparrow, “If the hunter devil is shooting without missing, we shall fly high without perching.” He will never get us. Make sure Satan never gets you. Sister, hold yourself well in Holiness Movement; God shall carry you on His wings and fly you to heaven. God will help you enter there. The holy life is a mystery to Satan. Before he understands what, we shall have left the earth to heaven. Praise the Lord!     **\n\n\nCHAPTER NINE    **\n\nTHE DIVINE PLAN TO OVERCOME ENDTIME CHALLENGES OF SATAN    **\nJeremiah 29 verse 11   **\n\n“For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.”     **\n\n\nEzra 10 verse 2     **\n \n“And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land  yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.”    **\n\nThrough diverse activities Satan is hardening the heart of men and pulling down the churches. These challenges are very present. It is\n\n Isaiah 43 verse 19 to 21  **\n\n“ Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.\n\n The beast of the field shall honour Me, the dragons and the owls  because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My people, My chosen.\nThis people have I formed for Myself; they shall shew forth My praise.”    **\n\n\nOn the side of God, the light is shining and that light will cover you and lead you to heaven.    **\n\nPsalms 23 verse 1 to 6    **\n\n“The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.\n\n\n He maketh me to lie down in green pastures He leadeth me beside the still waters.\n\n\n He restoreth my soul  He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.\n\nYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil  for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.\n\n Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies  Thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.\n\n Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.”    **\n\nGod has promises for the end time. Despite the darkness of the left hand side, there is the brightness of the right hand side. God has made adequate provision for the end time. He will save mankind from sin and Satan. He will preserve the saints on the earth till he comes for them.    **\n\nJohn 10 verse 27 to 29.    **\n\n“My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me \n\n And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of My hand.\n\nMy Father, which gave them Me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of My Father's hand.”   **\n\nGod will pour out His spirit upon all flesh for greater ministry. You who have committed yourself to His holiness will be blessed. You will become a great minister of Jesus Christ. The Lord wants to transform and anoint you. He wants to change your status.    **\n\nJoel 2 verse 28 to 29    **\n\n “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions;\n\n And also upon the servants and upon the hand maid sin those days will I pour out My spirit.”    **\n\n\n9.1\tYou Will Receive the Spirit Anointing for Exploit    **\n\nThe Lord has chosen you and He is going to pour out the Holy Ghost and special anointing on you for His end time assignment. Therefore, get ready for the anointing of the Holy Ghost. He wants you to prophesy. You will prophesy; you will stand upon the mountains and prophesy; you will climb up on top of houses and prophesy; you will go in the vehicles and prophesy. By your prophecy, there shall be end time salvation and world revival in the name of Jesus. That is what God will do. As for this gospel, it shall be preached in all the world.    **\n\nOne of the coordinators shared with me a revelation God gave him. He said we were in a vehicle with Jesus going round the world. The Holy Spirit was the driver. As we were passing through Africa, crowds of people were following us. Then we moved to Asia, crowds of people followed us. We turned to America and to Europe and even to Australia. He said when he saw the crowd in Australia, the Lord said, “I will do something special in this continent.”   **\n\nActs 14 verse 1    **\n\n“And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed’.  ** \n\n\nYou are one of the people anointing is coming upon, in the name of Jesus.    **\n\n\nMatthew 24 verse 14    **\n\n“And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come”.    **\n\nSome of you think when the scripture says,\n\n“This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world,”it means everybody will repent in the world. Not so; it is for a witness unto them, not their total conversion. But some shall hear and repent. Then the end shall come.    **\n\n\nEzekiel 12 verse 26 to 28     **\n \n“Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,\n\n Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.\n\n Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of My words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.”   **\n\n\nKnow that the time is no longer long. We are in the days of the return of the Lord. You may not have the chance to grow to adulthood before the Lord's coming. You may not have the privilege of graduating from the school you are now before the Lord's coming. You may not have the privilege of marrying before the rapture    **\n\n9.2.\tThe Wisdom of God to Save You and the Remnant    **\n\nThe devil is now doing his worst, both in the church and in the world. The God of heaven is the God of wisdom. He said the days shall be\nshortened. Do not think that satanic activities will dominate everywhere. No! There shall be sufficient provision for the people of God. The Lord will work against Satan in a way that he will not have access to you. You will finish your ministry and be translated to heaven. The days shall be shortened. A Sister prayed to God earnestly for the conversion of her mother! “God save my mother! God save my mother.” The Lord heard her and said, “I am going to save your mother; but when I save your mother, she shall not live long, she will die. I will take her immediately because if she stays longer, evil will over-power her.” That is God. He said concerning Israel coming out of Egypt to mount Sinai, “If I take this people through a short way to the promised land, they will face a lot of battles, and many will not be able to stand. I will take them by the way of the wilderness, because I want to preserve them.”     **\n\n\nMatthew 24 verse 21     **\n\n“For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened. There should no flesh be saved  but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.”    **\n\nHe shall shorten the tribulation days of Israel to three and half years because of the intensity of suffering, being the God of wisdom, knowledge and understanding. He can shorten a man's life span or the period of his stay to avoid frustration of his faith by the wicked one. God will take the appropriate decision over you in order to frustrate the devil and grant you eternal life. Co-operate with Him in righteous and holy living.    **\n\nJude 24 to 25     **\n\n“Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy,\n\n\n To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.”   **\n\n\n9.3.\tThe Battle Against Truth and Righteousness     **\n\nIsaiah 30 verse 8 to 11    **\n\n “Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever \n\n That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD  \n\n\nWhich say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits \n\n\n Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us”     **\n\nHuman beings are entering into covenant with Satan. The plan is to swallow up righteousness in every corner of the earth. They want to make sure the educational system is fully handed over to Satan in such a way that no righteous child passes through school undefiled. They want to make sure business men and civil servants are handed over to Satan in such a way that no single man or woman passes through undefiled. They want to make sure that the hospital system is so polluted that no person comes to the hospital and gets out from there undefiled. They are still working, boasting and beating their hands on their chest saying, “Righteousness shall soon disappear from the earth?”    **\n\nThey do not know the plan of God. At the time they think they have finished their plan, we shall not be on the earth, the church would have been raptured. God said those evil days shall be shortened. If those days were not shortened the pressure would be too unbearable even for those who are born again, sanctified and holy.    **\n\n\n\nPsalm 125 verse 3    **\n\n“For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous will put forth their hands unto iniquity”     **\n\nThe man of God says, Let me not be poor Lord, less I steal and blaspheme your name.   **\n\nProverbs 30 verse 8 and 9     **\n\n“Remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me;\n\nLest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.”    **\n\nThe situation can become so terrible but the Lord says, “I will cut short the time.” The Lord will give some saints the grace to die before the enemy gets them polluted. But the rest of us will go in the rapture! Now there is a plan. Why is God calling you into Holiness Movement? It is because He wants you to be preserved and be put into holy uses.   **\n\n\n\n Second Timothy 2 verse 19 to 21     **\n\n“Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Letevery one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. \n\nBut in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. \n\nIf a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.”     **\n\nThe Lord wants you to be among the remnant that should serve Him without pollution in this end time. God is calling you as He called Moses.     **\nEzekiel 6 verse 8     **\n \n“Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.”    **\n\nNow God still has people to save among sinners. These include children, youths, men and women. They are the people that are sighing now for salvation from sin and Satan. The Lord has seen them and wants to save them. That is why He is calling people like you for end time revival.    **\n\nExodus 3 verse 9 and 10     **\n\n “Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto Me  and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.\n\n Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth My people the children of Israel out of Egypt.”    **\n\n\nThere are still churches that can be revived through hearing God's word. I heard of a church; I think it is in Enugu State of Nigeria.   **\n\nThe pastor received with joy this word of holiness and righteousness in one of our crusades. He took the message to his church wondering, “Will my church scatter if I preach this message? “That was his fear. But the Lord has spoken who will restrain it? We cannot but speak the things which we have heard and seen. He went to his church and declared this truth. When he preached this word of righteousness and holiness, (maybe he was doing this shivering), the church members rose up and said, “Pastor, that is what we have been waiting for; we are ready! That is what we need. We shall go with it!” I learned that about twelve of those women came to Holiness Conference. A remnant shall be saved! That is what is going to happen everywhere.   **\n\nThe people that love God are still in the churches and in the world. That is why God is raising you up. He wants you to do a final work of salvation among men before the rapture will take place. He will fill you with anointing and power for evangelism and soul winning.   **\n\nJohn 10 verse 16     **\n\n“And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold  them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.”    **\n\nThe Lord wants to see true Christian women who are all out for endtime revival. Are you one of them, Sister? Please offer yourself to God to make you one of them    **\n \nIsaiah 6 verse 8    **\n\n“ Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.”     **\n\nLet everybody see you as a woman who has pledged to bring about end time revival. Mobilize other Christian women for this purpose to ensure the revival of truth, righteousness and holiness. Mobilize women that have bonded themselves for end time revival in the church, in every community and institution. May the Lord lay His hand upon you; may the Lord pour out His Spirit upon you. We need a revival, end time revival. Souls must be saved from entering hell fire. The church must arise to Christ's truth and be restored to his righteousness and holiness. Satan must be bound, and the remnant must be saved and preserved in the Lord for the rapture.     **\n\n9.4\tGod Demands for Prayers    **\n\nTo make this happen, God is calling on you to pray it in.   **\n \nIsaiah 62 verse1 to 7      **\n\n“ For Zion's sake will I not hold My peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.\n\nAnd the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.\n\nThou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. \n\nThou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate; but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah; for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married. \n\n\nFor as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee  and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.\n\nI have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence, \n\nAnd give Him no rest, till He establish, and till He make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.”     **\n\n\nThe Lord wants to do a special thing upon the earth. He wants to do a special work in the church. It is end time harvest, the final revival in preparation for the rapture. That is why He wants prayers. He has called you to pray so that He will do a special work of revival. In many instances, God limits himself to prayers.     **\n\n\nJeremiah 29 verse 11 and 12    **\n\n“For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.\n\n\n Then shall ye call upon Me, and ye shall go and pray unto Me, and I will hearken unto you.”    **\n\nHe says, “Pray and I will hear you. I know what I want to do but you pray. I know what to do for those people, but you pray. I know how to enter that nation, but you pray. I know how to enter into that tribe and cause My salvation there, but you pray. I know how to enter that church and bring transformation and pull down the walls of darkness in that church, but you pray.” The Lord is calling you to prayer. The Lord knows what to do in that religion. “I know how to break the backbone of Islamic religion, but I want you to pray. I will hear you. Call upon Me and I will answer you. I will do wonders; I will do great things, marvellous things in your eyes!” So the Lord is calling for prayer warriors that will pray-in final revival. That is why He chose you. This is your calling and you are receiving anointing for it. May the Lord put the spirit of prayer in your life in the name of Jesus; the prayer that will bring revival to America, Europe, Africa and cause the light of God to shine in Asia.     **\n\n\n9.5\tArise as in the Days of Deborah     **\n\nGod is calling for his daughters to arise as in the days of Deborah. The men are afraid; the men are away from the churches; the men are asleep; that is why God is calling on the women to come forward. Your Creator sees you with dignity. Your God recognizes you. You don't see the men in the churches; you don't see them zealous for God any more. Since the men are asleep and have given chance to the devil, the Lord now says, “Where are My daughters?” As in the days of Deborah, you will rise and do great things in the name of Jesus. Deborah sang a song because in her days, the men were afraid; in her days, the men were away; in her days, the men were asleep.     *\n\n\nJudges 5 verse 1 and 2    **\n\n“Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying, Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.”    **\n\nIt is your time to arise, because the men have sold the church to Satan. They have gone for magic; they have gone for money; they have gone for other things. They are corrupting the church; they are making covenant with Satan and are sending people to hell. God says, you should arise, Deborah. Awake! Awake!! Awake!!! Let the spirit of Deborah come upon you. The Lord is pouring the spirit of Deborah upon last days' women. You will be a great preacher; you will be a great gospel teacher; you will be a great warrior. I say you will recover the church, woman! You will bring revival to the world. That is why the Lord is calling on you.     **\n\n9.6\tTrue Men Are Few     **\n\n\nMatthew 9 verse 35 to 38     **\n\n “And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.\n\n But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.\n\nThen saith He unto His disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;\n\n Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth labourers into His harvest.”     **\n\nThe few men that are there are not sufficient for the great harvest. The burden is too great for them. The Moseses that are leading the work are now complaining, “Can I do all these things alone?” The few men that are there are sighing for help since their fellow men are not there; their fellow men have gone after Satan. They have entered into contract with Satan. The men are saying like Moses. “Oh Lord did I give birth to all these people? Why have you put this great burden upon me alone?” The men are not there, but the women are there!   **\n\nWoman, are you there? The Lord has turned to you, to help to bear the burden with the few men available. Revival must come! Yes, that is what the Lord is saying; that is what God is doing at this end time. Awake, Deborah of our generation; awake ye daughter of the Lord; awake ye mothers and sisters in the church. Arise and play your role for the game is on you now. We are watching you; angels also are watching you. The devil that despised you shall fear you. The devil that said, “Who are you? You are just a common woman,” shall go on the run. You will do exploits for Jesus. That is what the LORD desires of you.   **\nGo, recover the souls of men and women; go, recover the truth; go, recover righteousness; go, recover holiness in preparation for the coming of Jesus.\n\nThis involves risk, but you are our Esther. Our eyes are upon you, Esther. Take the risk. Even at your life's expense. Take the risk, these people must be delivered; the devil must be overturned! Haman and all his people must be wiped out. Many of the people of the land must become Christians. The people in your community shall become Christians. I say, take the risk. Are you ready to take the risk? Then the Lord shall be with you; you will cut off the head of Goliath. Pharaoh shall bow before you. Rise upon your feet, the Lord has laid His hand upon you.    **\n\nAct 26 verse 15 to19    ** \n\n“And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And He said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. \n\nBut rise, and stand upon thy feet  for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee; \n\nDelivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, \n\n\nTo open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in Me. \n\n\nWhereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision”    **\n\nIt is now time that women must go for this work. You must go for the Lord. You are a vessel of honour unto God. He has made you for Himself and the days for your exploit have come. These are the days of your performance, the days of your glory. It is time now to give glory to your Creator. The men are afraid, the men are away; yes, the men are asleep. The few that are there, the burden is too much for them. Rise up and work, open your mouth and say, “Lord here am I. I shall work and bring forth revival before the rapture comes.”     **\n\nFirst Corinthians 9 verse 16 to17     **\n\n “For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of  for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!\n\n For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward  but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me.”    **\n\n\n9.7.\tMy Intersession for You and Other Women     **\n\nI want to make intercession for you before the Lord. Just raise up your hand. I am making intercession for you who have read this message from the Lord this day in the name of Jesus!\n\nAlmighty Father, I commit this woman unto you; she is your daughter. We have seen that the Lord Jesus is already on the way. We have known that we are the generation that will see the Lord come to take us home in the rapture. Oh Lord, the world lies immensely in ignorance, the church is backslidden. Lord God, what a challenge! Satanic activities fill everywhere. The men are away from the church, the men are afraid, the men are asleep. Lord, the few that are there are saying the work is too much for them. God turn to your women; Lord turn to the women! Let the power of the Lord come upon the women; take them over, in the name of Jesus! Like in the days of Deborah, when the men were afraid to walk on the high ways, because of their enemies and they were hiding and following the bush paths until Deborah arose. I pray for special anointing for the Deborah that is before you now.   **\n\nO Lord, let Deborah in Christ receive anointing. Let the anointing of the Lord rest upon you; let the power of God rest upon you; let the grace of God rest upon you. Let the Holy Ghost anointing rest upon you. Receive, in the name of Jesus. Almighty Father, in her corner, in her church, in her denomination, wherever she is, revival shall spring up there. Oh God, receive this Sister in the name of Jesus! Woman, receive the anointing, receive the grace of God. Let your eyes open, let understanding be given you. Receive the wisdom of the gospel; receive power over Satan and demons. Receive the power for signs and wonders, in the name of Jesus. Lift up your voice and thank the Lord, lift up your voice and worship the Lord. The Lord has enrolled you and has counted you in the number; the Lord has put His Spirit upon your life! Thank Jesus.    **\n\n9.8\tThe Promises of God for Your ministry    **\n\n\nJeremiah 1 verse 4 to12      **\n\n“Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,\n\n5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.\n\n6 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak  for I am a child.\n\n7 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child  for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.\n\n8 Be not afraid of their faces  for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD.\n\n9 Then the LORD put forth His hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put My words in thy mouth.\n\n\n10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to\nthrow down, to build, and to plant.\n\n11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.\n\n12 Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen, for I will hasten My word to perform it.      **\n\n\nJudges 6 verse 12 to14     **\n\n12 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.\n\n13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all His miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.\n\n14 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites, have not I sent thee?    **\n\n\nJoshua 1 verse 1 to 9     **\n\n“ Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,\n\n Moses My servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.\n\n Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.\nFrom the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hitites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the Sun , shall be your coast.\n\n There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life  as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee, I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.\n\n Be strong and of a good courage  for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.\n\n Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses My servant commanded thee  turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.\n\n This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein  for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.\n\n\n Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.\n\nWhen you finish your service on earth, you will go to heaven peacefully, joyfully, victoriously, to receive great reward. Amen, so shall it be.”     **\n\n\nSecond Timothy 4 verse 6 to 8     **\n\n“ For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.\n\n I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith;\n\n Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day  and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.”\n\n\nPastor Paul Rika \n",

The points are given in a meditative manner to provoke conviction and righteous actions against sin in the believer and those around him.    **\nThe book is an in depth study on sin put in a devotional way for meditative reading. May God use this book to thoroughly purge you of sin, give you daily victory over sin and fill you with passion for soul-wining. The following are the short lines of words that receive full expression in this book  Do not commit sin. Do not hide sin. Do not encourage sin. Do not promote sin. Do not confess half-sin. Do not refuse to judge sin. Sin in you must not be given rest until it is gone. Sin in you must be exposed. Sin in you must be rejected. 8 Sin in you must be brought to Jesus. Sin in you must be destroyed. Sin in you must be replaced with Christ's righteousness. Sin must be resisted firmly. Sin in others should attract your pity. Sin in others should attract your prayer. Sin in others should draw you closer to them. Sin in others should attract an evangelism message. Sin in others should attract soul-winning methods. Sin in others should make you spend on the salvation of sinners in general. Sin in others should make you not fear persecution for their salvation.    **\n\nPART ONE   **\nSIN   **\nWhat is sin?   **\n How does the Bible define sin?    **\nRomans 3 verse 23   **\n 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;   **\n Sin is that which makes a person fall short of the glory of God. Sin does not give God glory in your life. That aspect in your life or character that does not glorify God is sin. Sin makes God frown on your character or attitude.    **\nFirst John 3 verse 4    **\n4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law  for sin is the transgression of the law.    **\nTo transgress the law means to break the law of God. Thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill, thou shall not commit adultery, and so on.  If you break any of these commandments, you are a sinner. If you break the Word as specified by the Lord, you transgress, disobey, cross the line, and that makes you rebellious. \nYou should do good, be kind, be patient, and be humble. When you display character contrary to these, you have broken the law. One example is given to husbands and wives.   **\nEphesians 5 verse 22, 25    **\n22Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;    **\nWhen you rebel against these commands, you have sinned. When you come short of these instructions, you have sinned.    **\nTHE ORIGIN OF SIN     **\nThe Lord created man in His image to enjoy His presence for eternity, giving him one commandment to keep.    **\nGenesis 2 verse 15 to 17    **\n15And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. \n16 And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; \n17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it,  for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.   **\nAfter creating the man Adam, God created Eve, to be his companion, blessing them to be fruitful and multiply   **\n Genesis 1 verse 28   **\n28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.    **\nSatan was cast down from heaven because of rebellion. Satan appeared to Eve as a serpent, deceiving her to disobey God’s commandment   **\n Genesis 3 verse 1 to 5   **\n 1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? \n2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden  \n3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 4And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die  \n5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.   **\nAfter yielding to Satan’s temptation, Eve convinced Adam to do the same.   **\nGenesis 3 verse 6    **\n6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.    **\nThis moment of disobedience was the origin of sin in the world.    **\nTHE CONSEQUENCES OF SIN     **\nThe consequence of sin is death. The Lord made this clear when He commanded Adam not to eat of the Tree of good and evil.   **\nGenesis 2 verse 17    **\n17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it,  for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.   **\n Because we are all descendants of Adam and Eve, we are born in sin and are naturally disposed to sin.    **\nRomans 3 verse 23    **\n23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;   **\n Following the physical death of all sinners is eternal separation from God in hell, called the second death   **\n Second Thessalonians 1 verse 8 to 9    **\n8 In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ  9Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;   **\nRevelation 20 verse 15   **\nAnd whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.   **\nHell is a terrible place. God does not want anyone to go there.    **\nSecond Peter 3 verse 9    **\n9 The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.    **\nRomans 6 verse 23   **\n23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   **\nThrough Jesus Christ, we can be saved. This book is inspired to bring clarity on sin and to help all who are serious about gaining the understanding needed to overcome sin in their lives. Here are the inspired thoughts on sin expressed. We will consider each of these points in more detail.   **\n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING PARTS DEAL WITH THE DON’TS ABOUT SIN   **\nPART TWO    **\nDO NOT COMMIT SIN   **\nFirst John 3 verse 4   **\n 4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law  for sin is the transgression of the law.    **\nDo not sin against God, against God’s Word. Sin is breaking the rule of God. Sin is breaking the commandment of God, the law of God. Sin means crossing the line God drew for you not to cross. Do not sin; otherwise, you will be breaking God’s rule. Adam sinned by breaking God’s rule that ordered him not to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Do not break the rule of God as is given to us concerning serving Him or living together in society, relating as a master-servant, husband-wife, parentchild.    **\n First John 3 verse 8 to 9   **\n 8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. \n9Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for His seed remaineth in him  and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.   **\nHe that sins is following Satan and is practicing what Satan did. Satan broke the law of God by disobeying God's Word from the beginning. Because of sin, Jesus came to the world to destroy the works of the devil. He came because of the activities of Satan. Therefore, do not go into sin to partner with Satan. Stay aside from sin. Be on the side of Jesus. Allow Jesus to destroy sin in your life, to remove sin, from you. Be born of God, and you will not commit sin. Be born again, and do not sin. One who is born again does not sin, because the Word of God is in him, the Spirit of God is inside him, and as a result, he does not commit sin.   **\n If you give attention to set your heart on the Word of God and listen to the voice of the Spirit in you, you will not sin, because the Word of God sanctifies a man and makes him free from sin. The Spirit of God removes a man from sin.   \nThe Bible says,    **\nPsalm 119 verse 11    **\n11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.   **\nTherefore, do not sin. The Holy Spirit will show or convict you of sin and help you not to sin. Therefore, follow the leading of the Holy Spirit in your heart, what He tells you, what He shows you, and the understanding He gives you so that you will not sin.   **\nJames 2 verse 1, 9    **\n1 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons. 9 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.    **\nDo not exalt a person above God. Do not fear anyone above God. If you fear someone, maybe because of his position, as leader, husband, wife, or father, above God, you are sinning. \n Do not commit sin means, do not come to the point that you fear man above God; to the point where you fear man's instruction above that of God. That a man's name threatens you more than the name of God is a sin. Doing something the Word of God forbids out of fear of man, is sinful because it means you respect man above God. Do not commit sin because of anyone.     **\nDo not break the law of God.    **\nEzekiel 18 verse 24    **\n24 But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned; in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.     **\nIf you are born again now, living righteously and fear God, do not sin. If you have come to Christ, do not practice immorality, do not steal, do not fight and do not tell lies. If you do, God will forget your righteousness. If you do and die in it, you will go to hell fire, and God will not remember your good works or your righteous service which you have done for  \nHim. God will not remember them because you have gone back to evil by committing sin.    **\n Do not commit sin.    **\nWhy should your righteousness be forgotten? Why should all the good works you have done be forgotten? Why should your good record disappear because you have returned to sin? Do not do that.    **\nJohn 8 verse 34  **\n34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. 35 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth ever.    **\nWhen you commit sin, you are no more the servant of God but the servant of sin. Are you a child of God? No! You are a child of sin, a servant of sin, because you are serving sin. Sin can send you to the city, and you will go. It can make you wake up in the night to do evil and you will consent. Are you then not a servant of sin? You are! Instead of God being the one to say, “Do this,” or “Do not do that,” sin has become your master telling you what to do and what not to do  sin tells you, Do not go to church, do not pray, do not read your Bible, do evil to this person and that one.” You are a servant of sin!    **\n He that commits sin is a servant of sin.    **\nJohn 1 verse 29    **\n29 The next day, John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.    **\nJesus has taken away sin from the world, so sin must be taken away from you.   **\n\nPART THREE   **\nDO NOT HIDE SIN    **\nDeuteronomy 13 verse 6 to 11     **\n6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers; \n7 Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; \n8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him  9 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. \n10 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 11 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.    **\nTo conceal, means to hide. Do not hide sin. Do not conceal sin. For example, you happen to come across a brother or sister in the church who claims to be a child of God but is living a backslidden life. They come to you secretly, desiring sin, whispering sin, maybe wanting to sleep with you. The Bible says you should not spare or pity such a person. Instead, they should be exposed, disciplined and chastised by the church.     **\nIf a married person is trying to lead you into immorality, he or she should not be covered. You must reveal or report them so that the matter can be investigated and that right before you, they will be rebuked, punished and judged for their sin. Why allow them to mislead you when Jesus laboured so much for your salvation? Do not hide them. This applies not only to immorality, it also applies to every other sin. Once you discover the person to be unrighteous in his ways or to be a hypocrite, reveal his sin, no matter his status, so that the church should be cleansed  because a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.   ** \n Galatians 5 verse 9 to 10    **\n9 A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. \n10 I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye would be non -otherwise minded, but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be.    **\nIf you yield to his invitation to immorality, he will get many more people, thereby multiplying sin in the Church. Obey the Word, practice the Word. The Bible says your eyes shall not pity such a person.    **\nDeuteronomy 13 verse 8    **\n8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him     **\nIn other words, you must not agree with him, not even listen to him or feel sorry for him. Do not let such a person go free or try to protect them. Do not, for example, say, “I know the Pastor. I know Holiness Revival Movement  if I tell them that I saw this pastor in a bar, or that I saw my coordinator in a night club, they will stop his Pastorial work” In that case, you are pitying him. You want hypocrites to do the work of God. How will God bless the work? If hypocrites lead the work in the church, how will the work advance? It  means you do not have a good mind for Jesus and the work of His kingdom. Don’t you know that the sin of one man is capable of contaminating the whole assembly?    **\nJoshua 7 verse 1, 11.   **\n 1 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, took of the accursed thing, and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel, \n11 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them;  for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.   **\nThat is why the Lord will hold you accountable. He put you in the position to discover the sin to know how zealous you are for His name, but you failed. Your sin shall appear before you in judgement. The register shall show the day the Lord revealed the sin of that man or woman to you, and you spared them; it shall show. Did record not show when Modecai revealed the sin of those who wanted to kill  king Ahasuerus? Was it not on record? What about the record of God, who knows what every man ought to have done but did not do?    **\nIf Modecai had allowed those two people who wanted to kill the king, Esther's position would have become useless, and the Jews would not have escaped the devil's plan. Whatever a man sows, he shall reap. \nThe evil you refuse to destroy shall wait to destroy you. The snake you saw and should have killed, but chose to let it go, shall lie in wait to bite you. That is why the Bible tells us not to conceal the sinner so as not to fall into the trap of sin or be judged by God.     **\nPART FOUR   **\nDO NOT ENCOURAGE SIN    **\nRomans 14 verse 13    **\n13 Let us not, therefore, judge one another anymore, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.    **\nTo put a stumbling block in your brother's way is to encourage sin. Why were you pairing that lady and man together, sending them together for an assignment, to where they could be alone, when they are not husband and wife? When you do such, you are encouraging sin. Why are you paying people a salary that cannot feed them? You are encouraging stealing. It would be better not to employ them than to pay them a salary that will cause them to contemplate stealing; because the salary cannot sustain them.   **\nProverbs 30 verse 8 to 9   **\n8 Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me; 9 Lest I be full, and  deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.   **\nSo do not encourage sin. Do not create opportunities that can cause people to sin. Do not lay a stumbling block that will cause another to sin. For example, you gave someone money to keep for you, but you are not checking to find out if the money is still intact. Know that for some people, this can present an opportunity for stealing! The devil will say, “Use it. He is not bordered about it? Use it.” But if occasionally you check to ask, “How far with this?” you create fear in his heart. Do not give people working with you occasions to sin in any way.    **\nFirst Corinthians 8 verse 9    **\n9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak.   **\nAs a woman, even in the comfort of your home, be careful about how you expose your nakedness. When you are not the only one in your house or the only one who has access to your house, when you have dependants, visitors, and neighbours, you need to be cautious and mind how you dress. You have freedom and liberty in your house, to come out naked  or almost naked from your bathroom, but do not do so in the presence of others, and let not your liberty cause someone else to fall. As a pastor, do you know that others can learn from you? As a pastor, do you know that others are watching you? Do you know that those who watch you are aware of your habitual lateness, and some will do the same? You have liberty and freedom, but let not your liberty and freedom cause others to fall.    **\nYou say, “I am not responsible,” but you are! How can a woman walk around naked in public and deny responsibility for the sexual arousal and release in men? What do you mean by “I am not responsible for the lust in their hearts?” You are responsible because your appearance sends signals to those around you or those you pass by. You will be judged a harlot. You will be judged a wicked woman. You might say, “I have never known any other man besides my husband. But you have slept with men in the spirit because of your naked dressing.    **\nMatthew 5 verse 28    **\nBut I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.   **\n It is okay to love people, but you must be careful not to give the wrong impression. Some women are playful. They might playfully and ignorantly do or say something that may cause some men to develop sexual feelings. Your tender and touchy nature may stir up desires in men. Do not claim innocence because God will hold you accountable. Do not go indecent with a man in talk, touch or look. Maintain safe boundaries in your relationships with the opposite sex. Can a man bring fire into his bosom and his clothes not be burned? Can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be burned? Can a woman come too close to a man without his body responding? Can a man do the same to a woman, embracing her, rubbing her back, saying “I love you,” and claim nothing is in his heart towards her? The feeling and words you say can stay with the woman for many years, and the devil can use them at any moment to direct her thoughts towards you. You must be careful!    **\nDo not encourage sin, do not create occasions for sin, and do not in your liberty lay a stumbling block for others to sin.    **\nRevelation 2 verse 14    **\n14 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.  **\nBalak invited Balaam to curse the children of Israel by casting spells on them. Balaam came and could not do it, for God had warned him not to cast any evil spell on them because the children of Israel were blessed. Balak had promised Balaam much money if he would do it. Balaam understood the things of God. He knew God did not condone iniquity. He knew God would punish Israel if they went into sin, so he advised Balak, the king of Moab, to release his women to go amongst the children of Israel, to socialize with them so that the children of Israel would be tempted to commit immorality with them. By so doing, they would break God’s hedge of protection around them and become vulnerable to their enemies. He taught Balak to cast a stumbling block on the way of God’s children. Some are teaching women how to marry. They urge women to flirt in different ways. They know that their teachings are not biblical. Instead of teaching them how to get a partner by praying or practicing righteous living, they teach them to get a marriage partner by carnal means. You who encourage false dreams  saying, “They should go and tell him they had dream.” You are teaching dishonesty and lies. You are encouraging sin amongst God’s people! Be warned!! Balak taught them to give the children of Israel the food of idols to eat so that God’s jealousy would be aroused; to invite them to idolatrous celebrations so that they would become defiled, and their God would remove His hand from them. That is what the enemy does.   ** \nChild of God, watch out against the enemies who want to destroy the plans of God for your life. The Bible says that we should watch and pray so as not to be victims of the temptations Satan sets for us.   **\nMatthew 26 verse 41   **\n41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation, the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.   **\nWatch so that people working against you will not have their way.   **\n\nPART FIVE   **\nDO NOT PROMOTE SIN    **\n Do not promote sin, means do not multiply or spread sin.   **\n James 5 verse 19 to 20    **\n19 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; 20 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.   **\nWhen it rains on the dry soil, the grass will grow. The more it rains, the more the grasses grow. So too, sin grows from the moment it is conceived. For this reason, you should not entertain it at all. Let sin not be named among you. Do not allow it to begin; you may lose control over it.\nFor example, you see a man you know sinning. Instead of confronting him to help him stop his sin, you keep quiet and do not bother about it. If care is not taken, this man alone can lead many others into  that sin, thereby multiplying sinful people around him and in the society. Now one sin has become ten. One sinner has contaminated ten people, and ten people are ready to contaminate others. It may progress geometrically to one hundred or two hundred or even one thousand. \nSo, if you see a believer overcome by some sin, gently and quickly help him back to the right path. The Bible says in doing so, you have saved a soul from hell and covered a multitude of sins. You have curbed the spread of sin. So, do not multiply or promote sin by being indifferent or deliberately refusing to act on it when you see a brother overcome by it.    **\nLeviticus 19 verse 16   **\n16 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour; I am the Lord.    **\nTalebearers promote sin. They come with half-truths or lies. Talebearers carry stories from place to place, adding and changing the details as they go around. They cannot rest until they spread whatever is on their mind. All those who love to share stories, reporting every little thing they hear, are causing evil, multiplying sin and bringing dishonour or reproach to the community by spreading iniquity. Some of these stories are not true or are half-truth. Is it not a sin to ask people to use the lies or half-truth you share? \nDid God bring you to this world to spread rumours? A child of God should never get people to a place of fighting, arguing, murmuring, or contention because of the information they are spreading. Do not spread sin. Talebearers promote sin because they contaminate people with their tongue. The tongue can lead many people to sin. So, learn to hold your tongue.    **\nJames 1 verse 26   **\n26 If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.   **\n If you vomit anything you eat, can you be strong in your body? Does that not show that you are sick? So too, when you share information you should not, it shows you are spiritually sick. \nThere is a story of three pastors who met to discuss their ministries’ challenges. The first one confessed to lusting after women. The second one confessed to greed, and stealing of church money. Finally, the third one confessed to gossip, unable to withhold any information that came his way. He said, “I cannot keep to myself what you both have said; no matter how hard I try, I have to tell others about what you have said, very sad. Do not promote sin. Do not spread bad or secret information. Information must go to where it needs to go, and by the leading of the Holy Spirit. Make sure you have heard well and verified the facts, then, with love, share with those concerned.    **\n\nPART SIX   **\nDO NOT CONFESS HALF-SIN    **\nGenesis 20 verse 12    **\n And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.   **\nAbraham confessed what was right only after King Abimelech rebuked him for lying about his wife, Sarah. \nDo not confess half-sin. If you sin and need to make some restitution, do not be ashamed to confess the sin, fully. This will show that you are genuinely sorry and ready for change.    **\nFirst Kings 11 verse 4    **\n4For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods  and his heart was not perfect with the Lord his God, as was the heart of David, his father.    **\nSolomon’s heart was not perfect before the Lord his God, as was the heart of David, because he had backslidden through his wives. As a result of being  led astray by his many wives, he could not fully be committed to God. You must be fully yielded to God to overcome any fear of harm, imprisonment, death, punishment, ridicule, or loss. \nBefore making restitution, you must pray that God should help you to be able to open up fully. For example, to make restitution for abortion, do not lie that it is a drug you took for a stomach ache that terminated the pregnancy. Tell the truth that you knew you were pregnant and knew the effect of the drugs you got from the pharmacy. Do not confess half-sin. Otherwise, how will God forgive you? He desireth him that will speak the truth in his heart. God wants you to speak the truth from your heart and be available for judgment. Then, He will say the Judgment has been taken away in Christ. It is as He sees it.    **\nIf you go to the market asking for five measures, will you accept to take four measures instead? You will ask for the five measures you paid for. Do you think it is God who will accept partial confession? \nWisdom is there to direct. Wisdom is profitable to direct, but wisdom must be in righteousness. It is wisdom when we know what to say and when to say it. Take Samuel, for example. When he was afraid to go and anoint David as God had commanded, God advised him not to tell the elders his primary assignment but to simply tell them he had come to sacrifice unto the Lord; Jesse and his sons were invited. That was wisdom, and that was how David was peacefully anointed the next king of Israel without the knowledge of Saul, the reigning king.    **\nFirst Samuel 16 verse 1 to 13    **\n 1 And the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite  for I have provided Me a king among his sons. \n2 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the Lord said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the Lord. \n3 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do  and thou shalt anoint unto Me him whom I name unto thee. 4And Samuel did that which the Lord spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? \n5 And he said, Peaceably  I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord  sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. 6And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed is before Him. \n7 But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him  for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart. \n8 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this. 9Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the Lord chosen this. \n10Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The Lord hath not chosen these. \n11 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him  for we will not sit down till he come hither. \n12 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him  for this is he. \n13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren  and the Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.    **\n\nPART SEVEN   **\n\nDO NOT REFUSE TO JUDGE SIN   **\n Exodus 23 verse 6    **\n6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.    **\nLeviticus 19 verse 15    **\n15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment  thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty  but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.    **\nOlder people are deemed right in some cultures and must not be judged. Whatever they say or do is assumed correct. That is culture, tradition, and not the Word of God; for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.    **\nRomans 3 verse 23   **\n 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;   **\nThat includes the young and the old. Do not avoid judging the older man or bringing him to the light of scripture. Do you want to send the old man to hell? \nSin is still in his hand, and you refuse to bring it to the light of scripture. Do the old not steal or lie? This trend is common in developing societies where leadership is highly exalted. Leaders are treated as angels who do not sin. The ‘big man’ is higher than the law and does not receive judgement. When God’s Judgment is in the land, the people learn righteousness.   **\n Isaiah 26 verse 9   **\n9 With my soul have I desired Thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek Thee early  for when Thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.    ** \n The big men are the ones that carry human parts in their vehicles, and because they are the governors, the senators, law enforcement agents do not check their cars. \nDo not refuse to judge sin. That is the principle in the church. Some will say, “I cannot sit in Judgment with that boy.” If you say such, you are not a Christian. What makes him a boy and you a man? All souls are mine, the soul that sinneth, it shall die.    **\nEzekiel 18 verse 4   **\n4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine; the soul that sinneth, it shall die.    **\nShould the boy not be given his righteousness? Thou shall not oppress another that dwelleth with you in the land.   **\nLeviticus 25 verse 17   **\n17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God,  for I am the Lord your God.   **\n Pastor, explain why a woman is saying you mishandled her. Please explain why the boy says you are oppressing him. Do not say because of your position, you cannot humble yourself in the presence of the accuser to explain any accusation. That is the way of a guilty person, a sinner. \nDo not refuse to judge sin. Have no respect for persons. Those you respect and refuse to judge continue to corrupt justice and multiply iniquity in the land or church.   **\nLeviticus 19 verse 15    **\n15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment,  thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty,  but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.    **\nDo not say, “This man is too poor; I do not think he can do this or has the means to do that.” Examine him since the report has come on him. Every report must be investigated without excuse or respect of person. Do not think a sick person is too sick to commit immorality. Underrate no one and examine everything. \nJudge in righteousness. If not, the oppressed may murmur at you for denying him justice.    **\nDeuteronomy 1 verse 12 to 18  **\n12 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? 13 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. \n14 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do. 15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes. \n16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. \n17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's  and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it. \n18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.   **\n Moses charged the judges and officials the people had selected to take time to carefully listen to the cases brought before them before passing any Judgment. How, then, do you judge without hearing the whole story? What are you condemning the other person for when you have not listened to his side of the story? \nIf the person is telling a lie, the Spirit of God will show you, as He showed Peter concerning Ananias and Sapphira.   **\nActs 5 verse 1 to 11   **\n1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira, his wife, sold a possession, 2 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet. \n3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? \n4Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. \n5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost  and great fear came on all them that heard these things. 6And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him. \n7 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in. 8And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much. \n9 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.  10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost; and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband. \n11And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.    **\nThe Spirit of God told Peter they were lying. Why drive people away or condemn them without hearing from them, after hearing from one side? Why automatically take side? Hear from both sides before judgment.    **\nProverbs 18 verse 17    **\n17 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. The one that tells his story first seems perfectly righteous.   **\n He could make you very angry, and you may rush into judgment. Do not pass Judgment in a rush; you might be judging and condemning yourself. David did so when the prophet Nathan came to tell him about the sin he committed by killing Uriah.  **\nSecond Samuel 12 verse 1 to 7    **\n 1 And the Lord sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor. 2The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds  \n3 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. \n4 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him. \n5 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die;\n 6 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. \n7 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;    **\nDavid got very angry when he was told a parable of his sin. Hear the cause, and listen to the facts well. If the opponent is Satan, do you think he will ever speak well? \nCan you listen to Satan’s side of the story and believe and say that the other man is wicked? Can Satan ever be righteous? If one of the persons involved is a child of Satan, don’t you think you must hear the other person?   **\n John 8 verse 44 \n44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own   for he is a liar, and the father of it.   **\nMust you not listen to the opponent of a child of Satan?   **\nJohn 7 verse 51    **\n51 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?   **\n Deuteronomy 1 verse 16 to 17   **\n16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. \n17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.   ** \nJudgment is God’s. God is interested in the judgment and justice to be practiced.  **\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING PARTS DEAL WITH WHAT TO DO ABOUT SIN IN YOU  **\n\nPART EIGHT    **\nSIN IN YOU MUST NOT BE GIVEN REST UNTIL IT IS GONE  **\nSIN MUST BE GIVEN UP   **\n SIN IN YOU MUST    **\n  Not give you rest until it is gone.    **\n Be exposed. **\n Be rejected.    **\n Be brought to Jesus.   **\n Be destroyed.    **\n Be replaced with Christ’s righteousness.    **\n Be resisted firmly.    **\nSin can come to you or can be in you. As a sinner, sin is in you. As an unsanctified Christian, sin in you shows up in ungodly character. What must you do about the sin?   **\nDo not rest if you see that sin is in your life. The tongue does not rest when something is between the teeth. The eye does not cease to blink when something foreign comes into it. Similarly, let not your heart rest and be peaceful when sin enters in. Let not your life be peaceful when you find that you have committed sin or are living in sin. \nIf, as a saint of God, you are overtaken by temptation, you should have neither rest nor sleep until the sin is dealt with. When sin shows up, seeking an opening to mess up your life, do not rest until you have dealt with the sin, so it will get no chance in your life. Sin is in you by nature but must go by your new nature in Christ. The Bible tells us how to handle this sin     **\n Psalms 32 verse 1 to 5    **\n1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 2 Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. \n3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. \n4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me, my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah. \n5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.    **\nBlessed is he who can remove that which is caught between his teeth and that which is causing blinking and giving no rest to the eye. Peace will always surround one who lives a sinless life. That you are not carrying guilt or condemnation because of sin is a blessing. God is not angry at you as He is with the sinner daily. Your heart has not registered any lie is but is peaceful, and glorious. The man, David, sinned. Righteous David fell into the sin of immorality. He was known to be a zealous man of God. He decided to keep quiet  that was where he failed.   ** \nVerse three of Psalm 32 tells what happened when he kept silent. He was shaking inside, never at peace. That is what sin does. How long will you be in that condition, in that darkness? How long will you be in the fear of not going to heaven? Just as you can hear someone snoring loudly in their sleep, this is how sin rings loudly in your ears when you commit it. Day and night, your hand, oh God, was heavy on me. How would He not do so? That was not the life God gave him when he came to Him. The freshness of life disappeared. The peace of life disappeared, and he became restless. He never had rest until the sin was gone, until he confessed. Your case may involve confessing to your spouse, church authority, or some government institutions you have worked for, for amendment or restitution. The sin in you must not give you rest until it is gone, as in David’s case.    **\nGod will give you no rest if you are truly a child of God. He will remind you to settle the sin when you come before Him. He wants you to be perfect. Obey God’s voice. You may have had many dreams, or many people might have spoken to you from God concerning that sin. It is wisdom to respond positively and settle issues with God.   **\n\nPART NINE   **\n SIN IN YOU MUST BE EXPOSED    **\nEither you expose sin, or it will expose itself, or someone will expose it, or God will expose it. But it must be exposed, for there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed.   **\nProverbs 28 verse 13    **\n13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper,  but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.    **\nIt is wrong to cover your sin purposely. To smile outwardly, while your heart is heavy inside. You cannot prosper that way. \nSomeone told the story of a maid committing immorality with the man of God she worked for. This man of God eventually sought counsel. The person he sought counsel from asked him to preach against the sin of adultery as a way to be free from it. He did so, preaching openly on the pulpit, but sadly, continued in the immorality with the lady. His problem was not solved because after confessing his sin, he did not proceed to forsake it.   **\nSinging songs to distract your mind or heart will not cover the sin. He that covereth his sin shall not prosper, but he that confesseth and forsaketh shall have mercy. Instead of labouring as David did to cover his sin, instead of calling Uriah back from war, to give him food and drink and ask him to go to his house to sleep with his wife, to cover his sin, why not labour in confessing the sin? Why not labour in the right way? Turn all the labour covering your sins into confessions. Instead of labouring to behave humbly and gently to your wife to cover your sin, use all that effort to confess your sins to God and to her. That effort you have been making, running up and down, should be an effort towards making confession and peace with the person.    **\nSin should not just be confessed. It should be confessed and forsaken. Do not just confess sin; confess and forsake it, so that you will not be tempted to return to it. As you confess it, stop it and do not go to it anymore. \n The reason you confess sin is to stop it, not to exhibit pride. You do not confess to others out of revenge. You confess out of guilt and condemnation to become righteous so that it does not happen again.    **\nSin in you must be exposed.   **\n Matthew 10 verse 26    **\n26 Fear them not therefore;  for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.    **\nTrying to hide your sin is futile because someone will reveal it someday. A power outside your control will reveal your hidden sin. While you choose to keep quiet to keep your honour intact, a power outside you, someone else, or God will expose the sin. \nWhen you visit fetish doctors who give charms to people, they present a list of the people they have been serving or manipulating to show you how powerful they are. To feed their pride and purpose, they must tell the next person, even though they may have told all those on the list that they are operating discreetly and secretly.   **\nIf you commit immorality with someone in secret, do you know that the person rejoices because they have been able to strip you of the glory of God? Such persons share their experiences with others to feel good. So, it would be best to confess what you have done so that as the truth spreads, you can say you are free. Go tell the woman you slept with that you have repented. Tell that man that you have repented so that he would feel ashamed, and know that when you sinned, you were at your weakest moment but have recovered yourself. If you are not revealing your sin, they will help you reveal it, but when you do so, you close the chapter. \nAll the witch doctors giving charms to pastors will tell you who they gave charms to. Some may lie, but many are telling the truth because they want glory. God may decide to reveal it to show His glory over your life, to shame you for being a hypocrite   **\nSin will reveal itself in you.   **\nNumbers 32 verse 23    **\n23 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the Lord; and be sure your sin will find you out.   **\nYour sin will find you out. Sin has a law of self revelation. That spirit will want to reveal itself. A lady was standing with her boyfriend when she suddenly turned into a snake but quickly came back to herself. While playing with other boys, a small boy suddenly turned into a snake, He quickly explained that his dad and mom often did that at home. They turn willingly, the demonic spirit in them did this for their shame.  \nYour sin will find you out. Why wait for the great shame? You may speak it out unconsciously. Get it over with because sooner or later, it will spill shame and doom on your life. At the appropriate time, you will start embarrassing yourself. Confess and eradicate it before it finds a suitable opportunity to reveal itself.   **\n\nPART TEN    **\nSIN IN YOU MUST BE REJECTED    **\n Refuse sin; fight against it. Go where sin is treated and get it treated. If there is a hospital where sin is treated, go there. If it means meeting with the consultant, do it. If it requires surgery, go for it to get it out of your life. Sin in you must be rejected.    **\nJob 34 verse 31 to 32   **\n31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more; \n32 That which I see not teach thou me;  if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.   **\nTell God how you have been embarrassed so much by sin and that you will not do it anymore. You have suffered so much shame and pain. Therefore, reject the sin that led to them. Determine that affliction must not come again. Decide that if you see sin, you will reject it. If you sinned because of ignorance in the past, now your attitude should be different because of the knowledge you have. If a bird sees you setting a trap, it will never go near it. Tell yourself, “Now, that 68 I know it is a sin, I will not do it anymore. I can never yield to sin again.” \nSin in you must be rejected. Give it no space or place. It must be out of your life. It must not sojourn in your life.    **\n\nPART ELEVEN     **\nSIN IN YOU MUST BE BROUGHT TO JESUS    **\nThe church is the hospital. The consultant surgeon that operates sin out of people is Jesus. He can operate and remove every kind of sin from your life. He knows how to handle sin in the clergy, in pastors, overseers, superintendents, senior pastors, church founders, prayer warriors, women evangelists, home pastors, pastors’ wives, and children etc. He can handle all – consult Him, look for Him, and He will do it for free. \nGo to Him and confess your evil. Ask Him to treat your sin problem. He knows exactly how to do it. He came for it and will treat it.    **\nJohn 1 verse 29   **\n29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.    **\nEveryone in the world, includes you. Your sin is not worse than the sin of others. Jesus handled all of them. Today if you trust Him, He will help you to enjoy the victory over sin that He has given to all who believe in Him. He will take away the sin of the village, community, the whole society, the whole tribe, the nation and entire race of people. He is the one inviting you.    **\nMatthew 11 verse 28   **\n28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.  **\n Jesus sees you heavy-laden and wants to give you rest. He is promising you rest. If you choose to do evil, He will condemn you because He told you He would set you free and give you rest, but you refused. You are responsible for your situation because you purposely refused rest and peace. Because you purposely hurt or injure people and the work of God, He will judge you. \nA story was told of a man whom someone preached to and was asked to give his life to Jesus and accept Him as his Saviour. He was also told that if he did not do so, he would be judged and would go to hell. The man asked if the evangelist had read the Book of Revelation in the Bible. He pointed out that in it, it is said that there would be war in heaven, that when Jesus Christ comes, there would be war. He said the reason why Satan was pushed down from heaven was because they were few at that time. “But look at the  earth now, we are in the majority, and we will win over Jesus.” \nThis is like firewood saying, “The only reason I am burning is that I am alone. When there is more wood, the fire will be extinguished.” Can that be? Instead, the flames will increase. People purposely say no to Jesus because they want to do more wickedness. Youths say they want to wait till they get older. They say, “Mummy and daddy, you have enjoyed life. We want to enjoy it too.” Which life did they enjoy? A simple life is a life of joy. Do you know the sicknesses they are dealing with because of their past evil life? Do you know the embarrassments they have endured? Do you think you can do the same and wait till the end to give your life to Jesus? You are mocking the Lord. The Lord has heard your mockery. Wait to see if you will know your end. God determines the end. Some die in the womb, some die as they are born, or after one, two, ten, or twenty years. How old are you? Many have died before that age. What makes you think you will live to old age? The Bibles says  Remember your Creator in the days of your youth. The devil will increase your rank in iniquity and harden your heart so that when you think  it is time to repent, you will not be able to; he will not let you. \nBe not deceived  God is not mocked; whatever a man soweth, that also shall he reap. The Bible says in the day of salvation, receive salvation. At the right time accept God’s help and release your life to Jesus.   **\n\nPART TWELVE   **\nSIN IN YOU MUST BE DESTROYED   **\nRomans 6 verse 6 to 7    **\n6 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.\n7 For he that is dead is freed from sin.   **\nIf you profess Christianity and say you are born again, but sin is still showing itself in your life, you are like someone wearing clean clothes with streaks of dirt. What are you to do? You need to die so that you will be freed from sin.\n In Nigeria, the Igbos say, “If you want to know whether a man of Igbo tribe is dead, go and count money near his corpse. If he does not wake up, then he is dead indeed.” This is to say they are very particular about money. Why do you get angry quickly, shouting at little things? Why are you reacting? It is because you have not died.    **\nIn the gospel, the apostle John wrote reports that Jesus was crucified on preparation day, the day before the Passover, a very special feast for the Jews. So they did not want bodies hanging on the cross overnight into the next day. They had to hasten His death and that of the thieves who were crucified along with him by breaking their legs. But after breaking the legs of those two men, by the time they came to Jesus, they discovered that He was already dead, hence they did not break His legs. They could not hurt Him anymore. You, too, must die. When you die, attacks and offences will mean nothing. When people lie about you, and you keep responding, this proves that you are not yet dead; you are still alive. Sometimes when you want to know if someone is asleep, you touch to check, and he may wake up. But if the person is sound asleep, he will not feel your touch. He that is dead is freed from sin. Whatever is happening, you are not conscious of it anymore.    **\nThe Bible says, knowing this, that our body be destroyed and that we do not serve sin. How do you deal with someone who hurt your pride or does not give you the proper honour? How do you deal with somebody who verbally abuses you? Your actions will determine if you have died or not. \nBetween husband and wife, who is dead? Why should not both of you die so that there can be peace? Or why can not one of you die so that while the other makes all the trouble, there is no evil reaction, no fighting back, no revenge, none, because you are dead? Jesus had already died when His enemies came to hurt Him some more. So, there was no reaction. When you are dead, you cannot feel pain anymore. He that is lying down fears no fall. Humble people cannot be broken, but the proud can.   **\nHe that is dead is free from sin.    **\nFirst John 3 verse 8    **\n8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.   **\n Sin makes you liable to the attacks of the devil. But God has come to destroy the works of the devil in your life, such as spiritism, demonism, Satanism, occultism, witchcraft, and other sins. Jesus wants to kill every sin in your life so that Satan would not be glorified in you.  Repent from witchcraft, occultism, Satanism, and other evils, for you cannot serve two masters simultaneously. The son of God was manifested that He might destroy the works of the devil. Confess those things and let Him destroy them. The Lord is merciful and will save you in Jesus' Name.   **\n\nPART THIRTEEN   **\nSIN IN YOU MUST BE REPLACED WITH CHRIST’S RIGHTEOUSNESS   **\nRomans 8 verse 3 to 4   **\n3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh  \n4That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.   **\nThere is nothing wrong with the law because the law is moral. Thou shall not kill, thou shalt not steal, commit adultery, lie, have other gods besides Me, thou shall not covet your neighbour’s wife, and property. All these commandments can be comprehended in the commandment of love  thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, all thine soul, with all thine mind and with all thy might, and thou shall love thy neighbour as thyself. \nThere was nothing wrong with the law or the commandments. What was wrong was sin inside the man. Sin has a stronghold inside man.  \nThe law got blunt because of the power of sin in man. Something stronger had to be done. The sin in man was stronger than the law. God went for something higher to destroy sin  the death of Jesus Christ, His only begotten Son. The righteousness of the law could be fulfilled only through the death of a sinner. Jesus did it for the sake of man. Man can now practice the righteousness of the law. You can now keep the law through Christ because Jesus has handled sin’s stronghold in you. You are now righteous through Him and can practice righteousness, the power above sin.    **\nSin in you must be replaced with Christ's righteousness – the righteousness Christ provides. Ask for it; you will get it in Christ. We are no longer under the law but under grace in Christ. You can now worship, bend, bow, yield, and practice righteousness. Take it, receive it, in Jesus name! Do not think you cannot come out of sin because Jesus has settled that which makes people to remain slaves to sin.  **\nRomans 7 verse 14 to 25    **\n14 For we know that the law is spiritual,  but I am carnal, sold under sin. 15 For that which I do I allow not  for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. \n16 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. 17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. \n18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing,  for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. \n19 For the good that I would I do not  but the evil which I would not, that I do. 20 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. 21 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. \n22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man;\n23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. 24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? \n25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.   **\nThe law is good; it is right. Do not allow anyone to steal your property or tell you a lie about the law. But man could not obey it because of the iron cast of sin in him. The law wants you to bow down and humble yourself to worship God acceptably. Sin is the iron cast. But sin is the strong metal that would never allow you to bend down to worship God, according to the law.    **\nIn verse 18, he says, “I want to live the life I know I ought to, but I do not know how. How can I be free? The cutlass and knife failed to cut off the iron gate of sin. That required a stronger force. Jesus came as that stronger power to dismantle (destroy) sin in me.” Verse 22. “Inside me, I love to do the work of God, but my members  ears, eyes, hands, and feet, delight in sin.” Your ears want to hear sinful things, and your tongue enjoys telling lies. The sin in you, controls them. \nVerse 24 – “This body is for hell, where am I heading for? Who will deliver me?” Jesus is the solution to the sin problem  God sent His son in the likeness of sinful man and condemned sin in the flesh. \nVerse 25 – You can be free. Jesus has destroyed the power of sin in your life. The Lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed to open the book and the gate of righteousness. Enter the gate of righteousness and celebrate righteousness and holiness. Jesus is that door.   ** \nPsalms 118 verse 19    **\nOpen to me the gates of righteousness; I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD   **\nJohn 10 verse 9    **\n9 I am the door,  by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.   **\n\nPART FOURTEEN   **\nSIN MUST BE RESISTED FIRMLY    **\nDeciding to stand firm against sin is a beautiful thing. Being a child of God does not exempt you from temptation. Living a holy life does not exempt you from temptation  birds still fly over your home.   **\nFirst Peter 5 verse 8 to 10    **\n8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour;\n 9 Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.\n10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.   **\nDo not use sin to fight sin. Use faith. Sin multiplied by sin is sin; sin plus sin is sin. Do not use a sinful method to deal with temptation. Carnal methods do not work. You must resist in the faith. Once, while I was at the airport to travel, one of the hostesses came near and sat with her legs open. I turned the other way. I did not have to confront her. Her seniors were present. To save myself, I turned away. Can sin fight sin? Resist it with the guidance and wisdom of the Holy Spirit. Resist sin through prayer and right actions.   **\nYou are not the only one being tempted. God allows it for a purpose; to ensure you learn a vital lesson or lessons. That is why He allowed Satan to test Job. If he tested Job, He would also allow you to be tested. He will allow trials to test you. For example, He may allow someone to spill water on you accidentally. How would you react?   **\nDo your best to keep yourself pure no matter the temptation. Show that you have been hearing the sound Word, which is able to deliver you. Your clothes were wet with water, not your soul. Keep your soul with all diligence; keep your heart. Your soul can only be affected if you start abusing the man and prepare for a fight or plan revenge or evil. Otherwise, splashing water on your body did not affect your soul. Your soul will be affected only if you become angry and bitter. It is the soul that sins that shall die. The body received splashes, but the soul did not sin. \nResist the devil steadfast in the faith. Some of you work in terrible places. You must keep praying that God will keep you for the period you are there.   **\nVerse 10 assures us of the grace of God that is made available and is sufficient as we go through the trials. God is the God of all grace. You can be without sin where He positions you like Daniel in the kingdom of Babylon or Obadiah in the cabinet of Jezebel and Ahab. \nGod is maturing sons for this end time, teaching you to continue to stand above the devil and his schemes. The devil cannot push you down with all his wiles because he is under your feet. Know and stay in God’s truth; it will always set you free.  **\nPsalm 119 verse 98   **\n98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies  for they are ever with me.   **\nHe is giving you this truth to make you wiser, so you will overcome when the devil comes like a roaring lion. You are built upon the rock.    **\n\n\n\nTHE FOLLOWING PARTS DEAL WITH WHAT TO DO ABOUT SIN IN OTHERS    **\n\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN   **\nSIN IN OTHERS SHOULD ATTRACT YOUR PITY   **\nSin in others should   **\n Attract your pity.   **\n Attract your prayers.    **\n Draw you closer to them.    **\n Attract evangelism message.    **\n Attract soul-winning methods    **\n Make you spend on their salvation.   **\n Make you despise persecution for their salvation.   **\nThis should be when you have already settled your sin problem. It takes a hypocrite to be busy with other people’s sins when he is also still in sin.    **\nMatthew 7 verse 3 to 5   **\n3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\n 4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? \n5Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.   **\nThis scripture addresses those who are busy attending to the sins in other people's lives. Why do you tell someone, “There’s something in your eye; open your eyes so I can remove the particle in it,” when a bigger log is in your eye? How would you even open your own eyes? You will not be able to open the eye; it will be blinking seriously because a bigger piece is in your eye. This is how hypocrites behave. You cannot achieve anything with this kind of behaviour. First, remove what is in your eye. As you now see well, you can help another. God expects you to treat yourself first. Then you will be able to treat others.   **\nPaul tells us in Philippians 1 verse 21 to 26,   **\nPhilippians 1 verse 21 to 26    **\n21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. 22 But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour,  yet what I shall choose I wot not. \n23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better  \n24 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you. 25And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; \n26 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.   **\n Here Paul is saying, “I am ready to go home. Sin has been treated in my life. I am righteous and now qualified to go home. I can pray to God that he should take me home, but I struggle. To go to heaven now is good for me; I choose it, but I also feel for your sake, it is better I should not go now, so that I can work on you more, on the issues of sin in your life, to establish you more  in Christ, so that you should be happier, being freed from sin.” \nPaul was saved, delivered, and he overcame sin. With that, he was ready to work on others, to save them from sin by the grace of God. You must first be saved and delivered to be engaged in the ministry of saving others in the bondage of sin, as the Lord gives the grace. Why should sin in others attract your pity? This includes even those who persecute you, hate you, or do evil against you. Because the Judgment of sin is very great.    **\nMark 9 verse 43 to 47\n 43 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off,  it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched; \n44 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. 45And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off,  it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched; 46 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. \n47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it ou,  it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire   **\n This is the situation of sinners. The soul that sins shall die.   **\nEzekiel 18 verse 20   **\n 20The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son,  the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.    **\nThe wicked shall be turned into hell and all nations that forget God. This is the everlasting place of sinners  burning fire is the Judgment of sinners. Should you not pity those who are going there? Will you not pity your mother and father heading there? Will you not pity your relations, neighbours that shall end up in hell, and also the Muslims and others of the various religions that shall end up in hell? That is why you must pity others.   **\nLamentations 1 verse 16    **\n16 For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me,  my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.   **\n I feel sad because Satan seems to have prevailed, especially, as I see the sinful lifestyle of many people in our society and even in the church. Some statistics reveal that 34% of the world's population are Christians. Which means 66% are pagans and non Christians. Of the 34%, 17.4% are Catholics, and 16.6 are non-Catholics. It is very sorrowful! \nNote that this 16.6% of non-Catholic Christians includes Jehovah's Witnesses, Spiritists, and all kinds  of people; included also are those that climb mountains, descend into rivers, and eat sand, grass and do many other strange things. \nFrom this 16.6%, how many go to church? May be less than twenty per cent are born again. Many deny the truth of being born again. How many Pentecostal rascals out there who do not know Jesus? How many evangelicals who refuse the Holy Ghost and do not talk about speaking in tongues? How many know holiness and righteousness? How many in the most holy churches are still sinners and hypocrites? How many are ready for the rapture? How many will be qualified to go with Jesus? Scripture tells us that only a small number     **\n Matthew 7 verse 13 to 14   **\n 13 Enter ye in at the strait gate  for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat;  14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.   **\nThe Ethiopian eunuch coming from a conference did not understand the scriptures. Do these people in the so-called Christian churches know the scriptures? 95 Were you not one of them? If you were left alone, would you boldly say you would have known Jesus and that your name was in the Book of Life? \nHell is where your unbelieving mother, brother, friends, and relations are going. Hell is where the unbelieving people of your tribe, nation, and world are going. If you are genuinely saved, pity them and do all in your power and by the grace of God to see them saved, mature in Christ, and prepared for the rapture. Pity the unbelieving president, Governor, pilot, army general, managing director, commissioner, senators, school children, students, market women, and neighbours who are not saved. Their tomorrow is not good.   **\nYes, sin in others must and should attract your pity.   **\n Matthew 18 verse 23 to 34   **\n23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. \n24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. \n25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. \n26 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. \n28 But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence; and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. \n29 And his fellow servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. \n30 And he would not, but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. \n31 So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. \n32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me  \n33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant, even as I had pity on thee? \n34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.   **\n Let us imagine that the first servant in this story was a Chinese, an Indian, an Asian, an American that had  backslid or a Catholic man, or one in any other church. The Lord showed compassion and delivered him. The Lord enabled him to come to the knowledge of the truth, to be saved, and to be set free from sin. The question to you is, what are you doing to that Asian, Indian, American, or African person in your place and about others going to hell? Do you pity them? Do you consider them and are concerned about where they will end up? Are you sitting still and not bothered? \nGod who gave it to you can revoke it. He spared you to save others, to be busy over the sins of others. Will you not labour to bring your relations to Jesus. If you do nothing, you will lose your salvation. Do all in your power to win the lost to Christ. Let God see your labour for them to be saved.  \nWith all I have done thus far, I am not yet satisfied; I am still considering the next thing to do, praying for more books and how to grow His ministry. How could you be this less concerned about the salvation of men?   **\n\n\nPART SIXTEEN    **\nSIN IN OTHERS MUST ATTRACT YOUR PRAYER    **\nSin in others attracted Paul’s prayer.   **\nRomans 10 verse 1 to 4    **\n1 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. 2 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. \n3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God. 4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.    **\nPaul prayed to God continually that the Israelites be saved. By this intercession, one by one, they are coming to Jesus, until the tribulation, when all Israel shall be saved.\n What is the righteousness God demands? Faith in the Lord Jesus. But the Israelites were not aware that their Messiah had come to the world. He came to His own, and His own received Him not. Israel did not know their Lord had come to the world. Paul was hurt that his compatriots did not understand that their Saviour had come. He was burdened. They were zealous in keeping the Sabbath. In defending the Law of Moses, they would want to kill others, even those talking about Jesus, and Paul used to be one of them. He prayed for the scales to fall off their eyes. God, remember the Catholics. They gather in their multitudes early in the morning. Streets are filled when they come out of a supposed worship of God, but they go to gather for a supposed mother of Jesus. Take a move around. What do you see? You see fields ripe for harvest. \nConsider the other churches where the God of holiness is not known. The righteousness they know is handkerchiefs, anointing oil, and worship of their pastors. They do not know Jesus. Their pastors have not presented Jesus well. Pity them, pray for them. Plead with God for them. \nRead the book, “Divine Revelation and Scriptural Exposition.” It tells the story of how the Lord took Sister Ladi to some assemblies with big cathedrals, with only two or three people genuinely living for Jesus. She went to many places and wondered why many people did not like Jesus. \nJesus does not want to return in tears. You may wonder and ask why God cannot just save people. Why must we pray for them to be saved? God has limited Himself to prayers. We must therefore pray for the salvation of souls. Even Jesus prayed when He walked this earth. In the Garden of Gethsemane, He counted on Peter, James and John to support Him in prayers in His difficult time. Another example is the prophetess Anna who is recorded as one who prayed for the salvation of Israel.    **\n Luke 2 verse 36 to 39   **\n36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity; \n37 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day. \n38And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.    **\nCan you rise early to pray for these churches? Pray for their ministers, choir members, and members of these churches that they may be saved.    **\nFirst John 5 verse 16   **\n16 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death  I do not say that he shall pray for it.   ** \nIf any man sins a sin, not unto death, pray for him, or pray for her. \nA woman wanted her younger brother, a drunkard, to be saved. She came to church to speak about the situation. She declared she would not eat food until she saw her brother converted. She dedicated herself to praying for the brother’s salvation. He was sitting in church, drunk. People came to her to say her brother had made his choice. One week, two weeks passed, and her brother continued in sin while she was dying away. \nWhen people saw her dying, they discouraged her. “Why will you kill yourself for someone else?” She came to church to declare that her body was weak and that she would soon be dying for good. She maintained her stand, “As I have purposed, I cannot break it until my brother is converted.” The brother was in the church, drunk. But that faithful day, the demon of drunkenness left him, and he rushed to the altar and gave his life to Jesus. Glory be to God! \nPray for the man that commits a sin that is not unto death. Has your wife or husband sinned? Is the sin not unto death? Has your son sinned not unto death? Sin unto death is sin against the Holy Spirit. It is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit. Has your mother sinned not unto death? You owe him prayers; you owe your sister prayers. The God who called you to pray will touch them wherever they are.  **\nMatthew 12 verse 31 to 32 says   **\n31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.\n 32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him,  but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.   **\nThe Bible says there is a sin unto death. I do not ask you to pray for that. The Lord told Jeremiah not to pray for them.   **\nJeremiah 7 verse 16   **\n16 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me;  for I will not hear thee.   **\n Jeremiah 11 verse 14   **\n 14 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them,  for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.  **\nWe should pray for all who come for prayers and pray for all sinners EXCEPT the Holy Spirit specifically gives a word of knowledge that someone should not be prayed for. The story below is an example  \nIn a visitation of the Lord at the Campground, the Lord spoke of someone saying, “This one has crossed the line.” Is that not sin unto death? No salvation can come to such anymore. That sin cannot be forgiven anymore. Do not pray for those whom the Lord shows you that they have crossed the line. Doctors know those who have crossed the line and cannot be helped back to life. For example, those in a coma who live with support from machines. The relatives of such persons are advised not to waste money anymore. In the same light, when someone commits a sin unto death, there is no need to pray for that person. They are gone!   **\n\nPART SEVENTEEN   **\nSIN IN OTHERS SHOULD DRAW YOU CLOSER    **\nMatthew 9 verse 9 to 13   **\n 9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom; and He saith unto him, Follow Me. And he arose, and followed Him. \n10 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples. \n11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? \n12 But when Jesus heard that, He said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. \n13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.   **\nThe Lord knew that the publicans, tax collectors, and all those called sinners by the society were with Him at the table in Matthew’s house. He was with them, talking and laughing, while the Pharisees were there, murmuring. Jesus told them that healthy people do not need a doctor, but the sick do. In other words, since they did not admit they were sick, they did not need Him. On the other hand, those whom Jesus ate with and attracted accusations from the religious leaders openly acknowledged their need for Him. Jesus told His accusers that He was needed where sinners are because He came to save the sinners, not the self righteous. \nIf I am trading in some materials, I must go to where those who need the materials are. Those that sell on the streets go to where people gather because that is where to find the thirsty to buy the water. They go where vehicles are parked with people. \nThat is what Jesus did. Firstly, He came to the earth full of sinners, and while on earth, He moved about in villages and towns, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom. Following His example, the sin in others should draw you closer to them. Befriend or begin a conversation with sinners to share the gospel with them. Do not feel too holy that you run away from sinners. A soldier runs towards war, not away from war. As a soldier in the army of God, you run to where sinners are with the gospel and not away from them.\n How do you run away from where bullets are coming from? To shoot down your enemies when at war, you must be able to see them. So you move in the direction of the bullets. A soldier who runs away from war is nothing but a coward. You do not want to be a cowardly Christian. You are a soldier in the army of God. Go to the battleground. Go into the world and win souls for Christ. \nYou must be interested in the salvation of your parents, siblings, uncles, aunts, cousins, neighbours, colleagues, and others around you. Visit them, greet them, and give them some gifts. But how can you be fruitful when you greet no one, you are never cheerful, and you do not interact with anyone?   **\nActs 8 verse 26 to 37   **\n26 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.\n 27 And he arose and went  and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, 28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. \n29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. 30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? \n31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. \n32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not His mouth; \n33 In His humiliation His judgment was taken away and who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth. \n34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? \n35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. \n36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? \n37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered  and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.   **\nPhilip was accepted, and only after that did he preach Jesus. Sin in others should draw you closer to them.   **\n \nPART EIGHTEEN   **\nSIN IN OTHERS SHOULD ATTRACT AN EVANGELISTIC MESSAGE   **\nLuke 13 verse 1 to 5    **\n1 There were present at that season some that told Him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. \n2 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things? 3 I tell you, Nay; but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. \n4 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?\n 5 I tell you, Nay; but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.   **\nHe was talking to sinners because sin was in them. It should draw an evangelism message.   **\n Micah 3 verse 8 to 9    **\n8 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin. 9 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.    **\nIsaiah 58 verse 1 to 3   **\n1 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. \n2Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God,  they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.\n3 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.   **\nWhen you understand that someone is a sinner, whether a family member, friend, co-worker or someone in your church congregation, tell them of their state and the solution  Jesus, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. Thou shall not suffer sin upon thy brother. Rebuke him, so that he may repent, by the grace of God. Preach the Word to them, and present Jesus as Philip did. The message is salvation in Jesus through forgiveness in His name alone.    **\nLuke 24 verse 47    **\n47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.   **\nYou are a witness for the Lord, so go preach in His name and tell people to believe in the name of Jesus. If you have the opportunity to preach in some of those unbelieving churches, then do not hesitate. Tell them to repent and come to Jesus.  **\n\n\nPART NINETEEN   **\n SIN IN OTHERS SHOULD ATTRACT SOULWINNING METHODS  **\nDo not do it crudely to make them run away, resist you, or cause persecution to arise.   **\n Proverbs 11 verse 30   **\n30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.   **\nTo win a soul, you must be wise. You must deal wisely. How did Abigail convict Nabal, a fool, a hardened man? She did not speak to her husband when he was drunk. She waited till the power of alcohol had left him. Then she confronted him with wisdom and humility. How did Nathan present the sin of David to him? The Lord sent him to David to rebuke him for his iniquity. Nathan went with a parable. He gave David a chance to judge the matter. What was the matter? A man had one sheep which he loved like a daughter and his neighbour had thousands of sheep. But when he had a visitor, instead of taking from his many sheep, he took away the only sheep from the man to entertain his visitor. \nDavid, upon hearing this story judged the matter speedily. Then Nathan said, you are the man. In what way? Uriah had only one wife, and you had many. David was convicted and he confessed his sin to God  “Against thee, thee only have I sinned and done this wickedness.” \nYou see, it took wisdom to get him to this point. Depending on the person you share the gospel with, you must use different methods or approaches, considering the prevailing circumstances and environment. We can use many other ways to win the lost to Christ. You can decide to write letters to some of them. For others, you can organize a feast to preach to them and give them gospel materials.   **\nJames 1 verse 5   **\n5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.   **\nWisdom is the principal thing in soul-winning. Ask God to help you, and show you what you can do. Ask Him for the methods that may vary from person to person. Get wisdom; with all your getting, get understanding.   **\nProverbs 4 verse 7   **\n7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom, and with all thy getting get understanding.   **\n\n\n\nPART TWENTY   **\n SIN IN OTHERS SHOULD MAKE YOU SPEND ON THEIR SALVATION   **\nSpend for their salvation.   **\n Luke 10 verse 30 to 35   **\n30 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. \n31 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. 32 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. \n33 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, \n34 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. \n35 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou  spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.   **\nSee a man in need. This man never knew him before. But when he saw him in the condition that required salvation, he did all to bring salvation to the man. He carried him on his donkey to an inn, paid for his treatment, left some money with the innkeeper and then promised to come back and take care of any other extra expenses. He never told the innkeeper he did not know the man. Some ways we can spend for the salvation of the unsaved is to invite them to our Christian meetings, but make sure you cover all their financial expenses. Buy gospel materials like videos, CDs, books, tapes, a phone, etc., and offer them. Spend for them. Jesus gave His all to save us. Should we not also spend to save others? That is what God expects from us.   **\nIsaiah 55 verse 1 to 2   **\n1 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price. \n2 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto Me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.   **\nAs Christians, we must help to facilitate the salvation of souls from eternal death with our resources. Why waste resources on things that have no eternal value but cannot invest for soul winning?   **\n\nPART TWENTY ONE   **\n SIN IN OTHERS SHOULD MAKE YOU DESPISE PERSECUTION FOR THEIR SALVATION    **\nJesus embraced persecution for the sake of our salvation. As His disciples, we should emulate Him and not run away from suffering, attacks, and persecution for the salvation of others. Let this life be in you, which was in Christ Jesus.   **\nZechariah 13 verse 6   **\n6 And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.   **\n “They nailed me to the cross when I went to save my friends. These are the wounds.”   **\nIsaiah 53 verse 1 to 6   **\n1Who hath believed our report? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? \n2 For He shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground, He hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him. \n3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, and we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was despised, and we esteemed Him not. 4 Surely He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows  yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. \n5 But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon Him; and with His stripes we are healed. \n6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.   **\nWhat He suffered, we should be able to suffer. “These are the wounds I secured when I came to the world to save sinners; now, we are friends. I call you no longer servants; now, you are my friends.”   **\n John 20 verse 19 to 20   **\n19 Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. \n20 And when He had so said, He shewed unto them His hands and His side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.   **\nNotice that Jesus showed His disciples the scars from the wounds. So too, we are called to suffer for His name’s sake, even to the point of persecution.   **\n Acts 20 verse 21 to 25   **\n21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.\n 22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there  \n23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. \n24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God. \n25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.   **\n Paul was not much concerned with what will befall him in Jerusalem as long as he could testify the gospel of the grace of God and preach the kingdom of God. Jesus said   **\nLuke 21 verse 11 to 14   **\n11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. \n12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake. 13 And it shall turn to you for a testimony. \n14 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what ye shall answer;  **\nBrother, let the will of God over your life be done. You must go after the souls of men, women, young and old.   **\n\nCONCLUSION   **\nNow you know what the Lord commands you regarding sin. You know what to do about sin in you and what to do about sin in others. Knowing is not enough. You need the power of the Holy Ghost to obey. You cannot do it with your strength.    **\nZechariah 4 verse 6   **\n 6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.   **\nWith the power of God, you can live a holy and righteous life, free from sin.  **\nPhilippians 4 verse 13   **\n13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. What is required is that you believe.    **\n Matthew 17 verse 20    **\n20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief;  for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.   **\nWhy ask God for food, clothing, shelter, promotion, healing, and everything else but not for the power to be holy, righteous, and free from sin?   **\n Matthew 7 verse 8 to 11   **\n8 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. \n9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? \n10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?  \n11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?   **\nAsk by faith, and receive by faith, walk by faith, and you will live free from sin, and the power of God will manifest in your life to save others in Jesus' Name, Amen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "        EXHORTATION TO FAITH IN GOD\nAND PATIENCE IN YOUR SITUATION   **\n\nINTRODUCTION    **\nHebrews 6 verse 12 to 15    **\n12\tThat ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. \n13\tFor when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself, \n14\tSaying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. \n15\tAnd so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. \n16\tFor men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.   **\nFaith is complete trust in God and in His word. Faith also means complete obedience to God and to His word. Faith believes that what God says will happen. Faith believes that what God says will not happen or will cease to happen will be so. Faith believes that what God promise to give will be given; what God promises to do will be done. Faith believes that the word of God is true. \nTherefore, believe what God promises you. Pray according to His will and know that you will have the answer.    **\nFirst John 5 verse 14 to 15      **\n14\tAnd this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us.\n15\tAnd if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.  \nThe scriptures show us that faith has time of performance which varies from “Immediately you believed” to “Several years after you have believed God.”    **\n\nGenesis 18 verse 14   *\n“Is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.”     ** \nAs there is time for everything, even so, faith also has a time of performance which is in the power of God.    **\nEcclesiastes 3 verse 1     **\n“To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven”  **\nActs 1 verse 7     **\n“And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.”    *\nBecause what you believe God for may not happen immediately, and what you ask God for may not be given you immediately, the Bible tells you to accompany your faith with patience, as Abraham did. Patience is the ability to wait for God or wait on God peacefully until His time to do it comes.   **\nHebrews 6 verse 15.     **\n“And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.”  **\n\nPsalms 145 verse 15    **\n“The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.”     **\nPsalms 40 verse 1 to 2     **\n1\tI waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.\n2\tHe brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.\n If you do not exercise patience before God, your heart will enter into doubt and your faith will be aborted. Have a fixed heart before God on that which you have believed Him to do for you not minding the time it takes, as long as you have asked according to His will.     **\n\n James 1 verse 6 to 8       **\n6\tBut let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.\n7\tFor let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.\n8\tA double minded man is unstable in all his ways.  **\n\n\nCHAPTER 1     **\nFAITH AND PATIENCE     **\n1.1\tThe Combination of Faith and Patience     **\n\nHebrews. 6 verse 10 to 15    **\n 10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward His name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. \n11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end \n 12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. \n13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, He sware by Himself, \n14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. \n15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.    **\n\nGod's children are people of faith; they are also people of patience. Therefore, make sure you mark and observe these two things in your life  faith and patience. Do not walk by faith only, walk with patience as well. The right eye is faith while the left eye is patience—He gave you the two eyes and that gives you the balance of sight. The right hand is faith while the left hand is patience, giving you the balance of movement. The right foot is faith while the left foot is patience, then, you can cover a long distance. If you use faith alone (one foot), you will hop. How long can you hop with one foot? You will eventually fall. That is why God is telling you not to allow yourself to fall away, but that you should continue to the end. The human race came into existence by two genders  the man and the woman (faith and patience) and this is how the whole world is filled with humanity.    **\n\n1.2\tExample of the Father of Faith   **\n God gave us the illustration of Abraham, the man God chose, which demonstrated the life of faith and patience before God. God dealt with him in these two areas  Faith and Patience. God made a promise to Abraham and he believed God. Because of his faith, he obtained the title, 'The Friend of God'. By his patience, he could wait for 25 years to receive the promised child.   **\n\nJames 2 verse 23     **\n“And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness, and he was called the Friend of God. “     **\n\nRomans 4 verse 17 to 22   **\n17 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. \n18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be. \n19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb; \n20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; \n21 And being fully persuaded that, what He had promised, He was able also to perform.\n 22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. These two things are important to give you a walk with God to eternity. They help you to enter heaven. The distance is long, but the two feet (faith and patience) will be able to walk you into heaven.    **\nJames. 5 verse 7, 8     **\n7 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. \n8 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.    **\n\nHebrews 10 verse 36 to 39       **\n36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.\n 37 For yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry.\n 38 Now the just shall live by faith, but if any man draw back, my soul shall have     no pleasure in him. \n39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.    **\n1.3\tHave Faith in God     **\n Mark. 11 verse 22 to 24    **  \n22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. \n23 For verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. \n24 Therefore I say unto you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.     **\nFaith in God is the principal thing. ‘And shall not doubt in His heart…,' shows there is a time of faith. It may not materialize immediately. There is a provision for test; will you be patient? Are you going to be patient until it materializes or you will doubt and become slothful on the way? Are you going to cast away the confidence on the way?     **\n'Whosoever shall say to this mountain…,' say it, but there's going to be a space of time (the times and seasons in the hand of God) for materialization. It is that time the devil will want to use to abort faith by making you doubt. Do not doubt because it is taking time.     **\n Saul, Samuel is coming. Do not be hasty to go and do the sacrifice because you are not a priest. Wait for Samuel! He that hasteth with his feet sinneth (Proverbs. 19 verse 2). Be patient! If it is not yet done, remember you do not have only one eye, the other eye (patience) is there for a balance. \n'It shall be done unto him…,' in the time and appropriate season of faith.   **\nIn verse 24, between the phrases, 'ye receive them' and, 'ye shall have them' is a space of time that is in the hands of the Lord and it requires patience. It is a time to wait and trust that God will not fail.    **\nHebrews 10 verse 35 to 38    **\n35 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.\n36 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. \n37 For yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry. \n38 Now the just shall live by faith, but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.    **\n1.4\tWith God all Things Are Possible     **\n Mark 10 verse 27    **\n“And Jesus looking upon them saith, with men it is impossible, but not with God, for with God all things are possible. “ \nCan you see that with God ALL things can be done?    **\n\n Mark. 9 verse 23    **\n“Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.”    **\nTo believe is to have faith in God. Come up to the realm of God and think His thoughts. Hand over that matter to God because it can be done. Hand over that problem to God and begin to see and approach it the way God sees and approaches it. Think of it the way God thinks of it. Speak to the matter as God speaks—that is faith.\n 'And it shall be done…,' because you have handed it over to God and it is now in His realm. Since with God all things are possible and you have believed, all things will be possible unto you.     **\n Mark. 5 verse 35 to 36    **\n35 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead, why troublest thou the Master any further?\n 36 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He saith unto the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.    **\n Luke. 8 verse 49 to 55    **\n49 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.\n50 But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying, Fear not, believe only, and she shall be made whole. \n51 And when He came into the house, He suffered no man to go in, save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. \n52 And all wept, and bewailed her; but He said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleepeth.\n53 And they laughed Him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. \n54 And He put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maid, arise. \n55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway, and He commanded to give her meat.     **\nPsalms 37 verse 4 to 5    **\nDelight thyself also in the LORD; and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart. \n Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in Him; and He shall bring it to pass.    **\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2    **\nTHE POWER IN FAITH    **\n\n 2.1 What Faith Can Do For You   **\n A trust or confidence in God by faith can give you the following    **\n\n2.1.1 Faith Can Lead You There   **\n\n Do you want to go somewhere? Faith in God can lead you there. It may be difficult for people to get to that destination, but you will get there because you have handed the matter over to God. He will be the One to take over. If it involves taking you through the sea, He will dry up the sea and you will cross over. As long as you have believed God, the matter is in His realm and He will lead you there. The mountains that may be on the way, will be rolled away by the Lord because you have handed over everything to Him. He will handle the valleys and the garrisons of the witches and wizards. He will also handle the demons on the way and you will reach the destination.    **\n\nEzra 8 verse 21 to 23, 31, 32    **\n21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of Him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.\n22 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and `horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way,  because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek Him; but His power and His wrath is against all them that forsake Him. 23 So we fasted and besought our God for this and He was intreated of us. 31 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem and the hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.\n 32 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. The winds and the sea will obey Him in your journey with Jesus to desired destinations.   **\n\nMatthew 8 verse 18, 23 to 27    **\nNow when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave commandment to depart unto the other side. \n23 And when He was entered into a ship, His disciples followed Him.\n24 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves, but He was asleep. \n25 And His disciples came to Him, and awoke Him, saying, Lord, save us, we perish. \n26 And He saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then He arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.\n27 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of Man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him!    **\n\n2.1.2 Faith Can Give It to You    **\n\nYou can get it, you can realize and possess what you desire, because God can give it to you. His power can give it to you. His wisdom can give it to you. Therefore, since you have believed, faith in Him will give it to you.     **\n\nGenesis 18 verse 9 to 14     **\n9And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. \n10And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. \n11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. \n12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? \n13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? \n14 Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.   **\n\n Faith can give you victory. You will overcome in that matter; you will overcome that person and his traps because you believe in God. You will overcome in that battle because it is God that will fight it for you. God will be the One to defend you and guide you, hence, you will win over your opposers.    **\n\nFirst John  4 verse 4   **\n“Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world. “  **\n\n\nFirst John 5 verse 4 and 5     **\n4For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world, and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. \n5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? All these will be, because you have faith in God. **\n6 Have faith in God! Believe that God will do it for you and you will have the victory.    **\nDaniel. 6 verse 16, 19 to 23    **\nThen the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee. \n19 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. \n20 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto Daniel,  and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? \n21 Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live forever.\n22 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me; forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. \n23 Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.  **\n\n 2.1.3 Faith Can Keep YourHeart Peaceful    **\n\nIsaiah 26 verse 1 to 4    **\n1 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks. \n2Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. \n3Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee. \n4Trust ye in the LORD for ever; for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength     **\n\n Faith will keep your heart peaceful in the presence of danger, because it is God that keeps a person peaceful. When the ship was on the sea and a boisterous wind was blowing hard on it, as if to sink it, Jesus was in the lower part of the ship sleeping. Have faith in God who is with you in that sleep. What can move God? What can win over Him? What can overcome, frustrate or kill Him? So, join Him up there (in the place of faith). Hand the matter over to Him there, you will be peaceful. \n\nWhen the disciples cried and shouted and said, 'Master carest thou not that we perish?' He would have wondered thus, 'How can you perish? You did not believe God? Don't you know that you're going with God somewhere?' You are going with God to eternity—heaven. You are going with God to the fulfillment of an assignment in this life, so He will not abandon you on the way. Rather, He will see you through all the difficulties of life. Therefore, have faith in God and you will be peaceful.    **\n\n Psalm. 119 verse 165    **\n“Great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them.”  ** \n\nIsaiah 26 verse 3   **\n“Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on Thee; because he trusteth in Thee. Therefore, trust in Him.”   **\n\n Deuteronomy 31 verse 6,8      **\n6\tBe strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them; for the LORD thy God, He it is that doth go with thee; He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.\n7\tAnd the LORD, He it is that doth go before thee; He will be with thee, He will not fail thee, neither forsake thee,  fear not, neither be dismayed.   **\n\n2.1.4 Faith Will Give You Healing    **\n\nJeremiah 33 verse 6     **\nBehold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.    **\n\nJeremiah 17 verse 14    **\n Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved; for Thou art my praise.    **\n\nJeremiah 30 verse 17      **\nFor I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, this is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.     **\n\n Faith in God will heal you because God is a healer. He heals His people. Healing is the children's bread. God will heal you because the just shall live by faith in God and therefore all things are made possible for the just. However strong or difficult the matter is, faith will give you healing and victory.\n\n Actually, due to the production of many healing alternatives by the world, there has been a lowering of the tempo of faith in the world. Many people no more believe on God. This reduction in the faith level has come to the point that many have come to agree that some sicknesses cannot be cured. Many Christians now agree that some cases can only be managed, without permanent healing. Thus, we leave God alone. We do not bother to ask Him to heal us. When such sicknesses come, we say, 'God, that sickness has come, but I will not bother to talk to you about it because I know there is no solution to it.' Is it in the face of God you are saying such a thing? Let's revive! God is a healer and He heals all sicknesses and diseases. 'Bless the Lord oh my soul…Who healeth all thy diseases' (Palms. 103 verse 1 to 3). So let us bring back those sicknesses to God. Let us revive, God is still alive! He will take away all manner of sicknesses and all manners of diseases and by faith, it shall be done in your life!   **\n\nExodus 15 verse 26 \nAnd said, if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God , and wilt do that which is right in His sight, and wilt give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statues, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians;  for I am the LORD that healeth thee.     **\n\nDeuteronomy.7  verse 14,15   **\n14 Thou shalt be blessed above all people, there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. \n15. And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.   **\n Matthew 8 verse 1 to 3    **\n1 When He was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. \n2And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if Thou wilt, Thou canst make me clean. \n3 And Jesus put forth His hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.    **\n2.1.5 Faith Will Give You Deliverance.    **\n\nJob 10 verse 7    **\nThou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand. Daniel was delivered,  from the den of the lions, the three Hebrew children from the fire of Nebuchadnezzar. They all had this assurance, 'My God shall deliver me.'    **\n Daniel. 3 verse 16 to 30    **\n16Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.\n 17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. \n18But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.\n 19 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.\n 20 And he commanded the mightiest men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.\n21 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. \n22 Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.\n23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. \n24 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king. \n25 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God. \n26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire. \n27 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them. \n28 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. 29 Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort. \n30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.    **\n\nOur God shall deliver us. He remains a deliverer in whatever state  confused, complex, problem with man, woman, the government, court, neighbours, relations, institutions or whatever it may be. Come to Him in the realm of faith. Meet with Him up in faith and you will see deliverance in your life.    **\n\n Second Corinthians.1 verse 8 to 10    **\nFor we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life. \nBut we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead. \nWho delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver, in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;    **\n\n Psalms 50 verse 15    **\nAnd call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify Me.    **\n\n2.1.6 Faith Can Give You Prosperity    **\n Job 36 verse 11    **\n“If they obey and serve Him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.”    **\n Why are we struggling on our own and leaving God out of our way? Why are you leaving God out? Why are you following the formulas of this earth and forgetting the Maker? You do not have a job and you do not know that God makes a way where there is no way? Come up to Him in the realm of faith and meet with Him there. All things are possible to Him that believeth.     **\nPsalm 81 verse 13 to 16     **\n 13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto Me, and Israel had walked in My ways! \n14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned My hand against their adversaries. \n15\tThe haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto Him, but their time should have endured for ever. \n16\tHe should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat  and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee. Do not wait for the formulas or principles of this life. Where the principles fail, go to Him that surpasses principles, the God of heaven. He has another way for you and you will prosper in this life. Faith in God will give you prosperity.  **\n\nDo not wait for the formulas or principles of this life. Where the principles fail, go to Him that surpasses principles, the God of heaven. He has another way for you and you will prosper in this life. Faith in God will give you prosperity.    **\n\nFirst Chronicles 4 verse 9,10    **\n“And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren  and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with sorrow. \nAnd Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that Thou wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that Thine hand might be with me, and that Thou wouldest keep me from evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that which he requested.”    **\n Luke 5 verse 4 to 7    **\nNow when He had left speaking, He said unto Simon, launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. \n5 And Simon answering said unto Him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing, nevertheless at Thy word I will let down the net.\n6 And when they had this done, they in closed a great multitude of fishes, and their net brake. \n7 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.   **\n\n 2.1.7 Faith Can Give You The Desired Miracle     **\n\nMark 11 verse 24    **\n“Therefore I say unto you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”   **\n\n'Therefore, whatsoever ye desire....' Faith can give you the desired miracles in your life  a spouse, children, job healing, promotion and more. The miracle of money (financial breakthrough), faith can give it to you. Good things will happen in your life.    **\n\nFirst Samuel 1 verse 9 to 15,19,20,26,27.    **\n9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD. \n 10And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore. \n11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if Thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of Thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget Thine handmaid, but wilt give unto Thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. \n12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. \n13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. \n14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. \n16\tAnd Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit, I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.\n 19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.\n 20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.\n 26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. \n27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of Him     **\n\nCHAPTER 3   **\nFAITH, TIME AND SEASON    **\n3.1 Faith Works With Times and Seasons    **\n Genesis. 18 verse 14     **\n “Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.”   ** \n Despite the fact that faith can give you everything, you need to know that it works with times and seasons.    **\n Ecclesiastes 3 verse 1     **\n“To everything there's a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven  “     **\nEven faith too has season and time. God Himself, has times and seasons in which He does things. Jesus told His mother, 'Mine hour is not yet come' (John. 2 verse 4)      **\nActs 1 verse 6,7    **\n6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel? \n7And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.    **\n\n3.2. You Have Your Time, The Father Has His    **\n (The Certainty of God's Promise)    **\nIsaiah 55 verse 8, 9   **\n8\tFor My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways, saith the LORD. \n9\tFor as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.    **\nMy ways are not your ways, My thoughts are not your thoughts, My time is not your time, My season is not your season. However, the word shall not fail. The Father has the time of faith in His hands. \nFrom your own time of faith to God's time of faith when it shall be fulfilled, is what is called, patience. There is a distance there. That road you are treading is called, 'the road of Faith and Patience'. Abraham's own road took him 25 years.  **\n\n Hebrews 6 verse 12 to 15    **\n 12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. \n13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, He sware by himself,\n 14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. \n15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.    **\nFaith gets it done at the promised (appointed) time. Faith will get that which you have believed God for, to come to pass at the appointed time.    **\n3.3 The Righteous Shall Live by His Faith     **\n Hebrews 2 verse 1 to 4    **\n 1 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what He will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.\n2\tAnd the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. \n3\tFor the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie; though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry. \n4\tBehold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him, but the just shall live by his faith.     **\nCan you understand the power, word and actions of faith? It shall materialize and bring forth fruits, but at its appointed time. There is a time you will see that healing manifest. There will be a time you will see that miracle granted, and will see that enemy actually defeated. There is a time you will see that thing you are looking for provided. There will come a time you will see the victory realized. There will be a time you will see that the car will be bought, a time will come that the house you have trusted God for, shall be built. There will come a time that you will say, 'I have finished my school'. A time is coming when you will exclaim and say of your wife, 'This was the woman I had desired to marry that I didn't know how it would work. I decided to commit it to God in prayers and see, she's now mine!' That is the time of faith. Wait for it, it shall happen! It shall come to pass!    **\n\nHebrews 6 verse 13 to 19   **\n 13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, He sware by Himself, \n14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. \n15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. \n16 For men verily swear by the greater; and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. \n17\tWherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath.\n\n18\tThat by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us; \n\n19\t Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;   **\n\n You may have been praying for the conversion of your spouse, just know that after the prayer of faith, a time of materialization is there, wait for it. A time will come that your husband will carry this Bible along with you and you two will be going for evangelism together! For with God, all things are possible. All things are possible to him that believes. But there is time between prayer and fulfillment  the time of faith, the time to wait.    ** \\n\nPsalm 27 verse 13, 14     **\n13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. \n14 Wait on the LORD, be of good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart. wait, I say, on the LORD.    **\n3.4 Do Not Abort Your Faith    **\nYou need to learn and understand this so that you will not give up on the way of faith. The devil is the one torturing, mocking and taunting you so that you should doubt and abort your faith. Just like a child that was formed in the womb but was aborted, your faith has been formed, but the devil wants you to abort it. Faith is there, you have been following it, but it can get aborted if you do not understand.    **\nHosea 4 verse 6   **\n“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to Me seeing thou forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.”    **\n Hebrews 10 verse 38, 39    **\n38 Now the just shall live by faith, but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. \n39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.    **\n3.5 Declare What You Believe God For    **\nHabakkuk 2 verse 1 to 4    **\n1 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what He will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.\n2And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. \n\n3For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry\n4Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him; but the just shall live by his faith.    **\n 'Make it plain,' do not hide what you believe God for. Tell yourself, confess it and tell others if that is required. Do not be ashamed about it. Do not doubt it or conceal it. 'It will surely come,' it will certainly happen. It will not fail, do not doubt it. But the problem of man is doubt. When the Son of Man cometh, will He find faith upon the earth? Will He find you waiting for the promise of faith?  **\n Luke 18 verse 7, 8    **\n7 And shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them? \n8 I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?   **\n 3.6 God Will Manage The Interval Between Faith and Fulfillment     **\nFaith will make you live, it will make you win and overcome if you learn it. God, who has the time, will manage that time interval in your life. Between the time you believe and the time it will eventually materialise, is not known. But however long it is, God will manage it. 25 years? God will manage it. Whatever is the difference in the timing, God will ensure the blessing will not come late. That thing will not be done late; it shall come in its right time. 'God shall help her and that, right early.'     **\n\n Psalms 46 verse 5   **\n“God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God shall help her, and that right early.”    ** \n3.7 Faith Gets It Done At the Appointed Time   **\n Genesis 18 verse 14   **\n“ Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed, I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.”    **\nThere is an appointed time for everything or promise. Brother, go back and dust your faith because it has not yet expired. Your license has not yet expired and so it can still be acknowledged by the policemen on the way, it can still grant you pass. In case you are about to drop your faith, do not drop it, because, you are much closer to the time of materialization!    **\n Romans 13 verse 11   **\n“ And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep, for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.”    **\nGod told Abraham, 'At the time appointed'. Who appointed the time? Was it Abraham? Certainly not. It is not for you to know the times and the seasons God kept in His own hands.    **\n\nActs 1 verse 7   **\nAnd He said unto them, it is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in His own power.   **\n Sometimes, though, God may communicate the time of the performance of faith to your heart as in the message by Prophet Elisha, 'By thistime tomorrow…,' God gets it done.    **\nSecond Kings  7 verse 1   **\n“Then Elisha said, hear ye the word of the LORD, thus saith the LORD, to morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.”    **\nThis is only because God communicated it to him. But in general matters, the times and the seasons are in His hands. God says He has an appointed time for you. Why are you disbelieving Him because He has not yet come? Why are you dropping your faith and commitment because He has not yet come? Why are you turning your back because God has not yet come?  **\n \nHebrews  10 verse 38, 39  **\n 38 Now the just shall live by faith, but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. \n39 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.    **\nWe have picked up faith in God, we stand by that faith and our faith must come to pass. Our faith must be rewarded. God really visited Sarah at the appointed time. According to the time of life  is it not life God is going to give you, Sarah? There is a time that life will come, for God has calculated it. Everything has its time and season. Nothing can be done late by God.  **\nJohn 11 verse  21 to 45  **\n21Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.\n 22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee.\n 23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. \n24 Martha saith unto Him, I know that He shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. \n25 Jesus said unto her, I am the Resurrection, and the Life, he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; \n26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this? \n27 She saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world. \n28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. \n29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto Him. \n30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him. \n31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. \n32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. \n33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, \n34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come and see. \n35 Jesus wept. \n36 Then said the Jews, Behold how He loved him! \n37 And some of them said, Could not this Man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? \n38 Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. \n39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto Him, Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he hath been dead four days. \n40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? \n41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus lifted up His eyes, and said, Father, I thank Thee that thou hast heard Me. \n42 And I knew that Thou hearest Me always, but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that Thou hast sent Me. \n43 And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. \n44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go. \n45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on Him.   **\n\nThe above scripture showed that no time is too late in the sight of God, and there is no delay in His plan, but that His name should be glorified in the end, as in the above case of Lazarus.  **\n 3.8 Faith Speaks At the End.  ** \nFaith becomes a substance at the end, it becomes tangible at the end. Faith forms the physical substance at the end.  **\nHebrews 11 verse 1,2  **\n1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. \n2For by it the elders obtained a good report.   **\n\nBy substance, it means you can now touch it and feel it. By evidence, it means you can now see it with your physical eye, but you will see that at the end. The blessings of faith come at the end. Right now it is in your heart in the realm of faith. Reality will come at the end of the time of faith.  **\n\n First Peter 1 verse 9    **\n“Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.”   **\n\n Faith is not continuous without end. It has an end. Faith comes to an end and it is at the end the substance you have been hoping for lies. It is at the end of faith that the evidence you have believed will be seen. Faith will bring it out to you.   **\n\nFaith is like the bread you cast into the water and expect it to come up to the top of the water. The Bible says, 'cast your bread upon the waters and you shall find it after many days' (Ecclesiastes 11 verse 1). There is the time between the casting of the bread and the 'finding it on top – after many days!' What are those days fulfilling? They are required to enable the water cover the bread and soak every particle in it very well, such that the bread will completely lose its weight and come up to the top of the water. That will definitely take time, but wait for it!   **\n\n\nCHAPTER 4    **\nFAITH INFORMS YOU TO WAIT   **\n\n Isaiah 28 verse 16    **\n“ Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make a haste.”  **\n\n4.1\tHe that Believeth shall not make a haste.   **\nFaith speaks and informs his people to wait. Are you a man or woman of faith? Then Faith is telling you to wait. There is a waiting time.  **\n\nPsalms. 27 verse 14   **\n “Wait on the LORD, Be o f good courage, and He shall strengthen thine heart  wait, I say, on the LORD.”    **\nYou have prayed, now wait. You have believed, now wait. Wait on the LORD. Be of good courage because the time of waiting may be long, Brother, you desire to marry and you have prayed but when you look around, you do not see any lady you can marry, wait. Sister, in the place you are, you feel you are alone and when you look around, nobody is qualified to marry you in that place, well, God has not said you will marry in that place, but that He will give you a husband. Just wait. That is God's voice to you.  **\n\nPsalms. 40 verse 1 to 4   **\n“ 1 I waited patiently for the LORD; and He inclined unto me, and heard my cry. \nHe brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings. \nAnd He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God  many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.\nBlessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.”   **\n The problem is that you do not want to suffer at all. But do you know that God is interested in you suffering? He wants that, so that when the answer comes, you will be so happy and will testify about it. It will be so sweet that you will not be quiet about it. The sleep of a labouring man is sweet (Ecclesiastes 5 verse 12). He has laboured so much that when he goes to sleep, it will be deep and sweet.  **\n First Peter 5 verse 10    **\n “But the God of all grace, Who hath called us unto His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.”    **\nThe Bible says, 'But the God of all grace…after that ye have suffered a while,' meaning, He is interested in your suffering and that is why He said you should wait  **\n First Peter 5 verse 8 to 11  **\n“Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour; \n Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. \n But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. \n To Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.”    **\n You may protest and say, 'But God, it is paining me!' His reply to you is, 'Wait in pain. I am coming.' You may also say, 'God, it is giving me shame!' He will say to you, 'Shame because of righteousness? Be there. When the glory comes, you will rejoice with exceeding joy.' 'How long, Lord?' As long as the time in His hand. Wait for Him. Abraham waited without date for Twenty-Five years. You should also wait; only God knows the right time and how long, which according to Him, must surely come to pass. After you have suffered a while, God will perfect your life, establish you, strengthen you, settle you and make you good! Just wait for Him.  **\n4.2\tPatience is Required to Make You Wait    **\nTo be patient means, to wait if necessary; not losing one's temper while waiting, and not bothered with having to wait. Patience gives one the power and energy to wait for faith's manifestation. Hence, be patient. For the husbandman (the farmer) waits for the former and latter rain before he can harvest. He waits, so wait. Have you believed God? Then wait.    **\n\nJames 5 verse 7, 10, 11  **\n 7 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. \n10\tTake, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. \n11 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.  **\n 4.3 Importance of Patience   **\n4.3.1 Patience gives peace to the heart  **\nIf someone says to you, 'Wait for me here. I will be back!' Does he specify a time? But you can decide to tell yourself that even though you were not given a specific time, you will give yourself time. You may tell yourself that you are going to stay peacefully for two hours, waiting for him. When you inform yourself about that personal decision of yours, will you get worried? No. What if he comes in 20 minutes, has he come late? Actually, he came an hour 40 minutes earlier than you expected him, because you made provision for 2 hours for your waiting. Patience is that provision in your life to wait for faith's manifestation. By it, you are made peaceful. You have need of patience to be able to receive the promise.    **\nHebrews. 10 verse 36     **\n“For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.”  **\n4.3.2 Patience cancels fear from the heart      **\nThe fear that your expectation will not be fulfilled will be cancelled when you inform yourself to be patient.    **\nRomans. 8 verse 25 “But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.”    **\n 4.3.3 Patience gives confession to the mouth     **\n This is because, the heart may be saying, 'what if it does not happen?' But patience will say, 'It will happen. It will be done, it is well, the Lord shall do it, He shall answer, He will fulfil His word. The Lord will perform it'.    **\n4.3.4 Patience is the antidote to the abortion of faith's seed    **\n The seed of faith that is formed in you can easily die except patience comes into play. Patience protects that seed of faith from being aborted. It is sensitive. Your faith can easily be affected but patience says, 'No , stand here and wait for it'.    **\n Colossians. 1 verse 11   **\n “Strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;”    **\n 4.3.5 Patience renews the strength of the people of faith    **\n so, they can keep believing. You are admonished to patiently endure. You need energy to go forward, or to stand still. Patience renews that energy.    **\nRomans. 15 verse 4   **\n “For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.”  **\n 4.3.6 Patience strengthens hope and makes the people of faith hope against hope   **\nRomans 4 verse 17 to 22  **\n17\t(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. \n18\tWho against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.\n19\tAnd being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb; \n20\tHe staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; \n21\tAnd being fully persuaded that, what He had promised, He was able also to perform. \n22\tAnd therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.   **\n  Patience told Abraham it would still be done. Even when Sarah had stopped menstruating, patience told him, 'Do not worry about the fact that she has stopped menstruating, for it will still be done'.   **\n  Give room to patience in your life. The Lord is still affirming that the circumstance of your wife or husband shall change. Why will you not believe it? Do not say, 'Why has it not happened all this while?' Be patient. The Lord is still saying you will win, you will realize it. Do not say to Him, 'How long have you been saying that?' Be patient. You will come to see it later. The Lord is still saying you will get married and you wonder, 'Marry?' Just be patient; give Him time. Wait for His time. Patience protected Abraham from unbelief and renewed his strength. Patience helped him to come to the end of faith.   **\n 4.3.7 Patience preserves the soul and makes it partake surely of the blessings of faith   **\n Luke. 2 verse 19   **\n“ In your patience, possess ye your souls.“  **\nIt is in your patience that you will possess your blessings, victory, healing, and deliverance; and in your patience, you will receive your crown.    **\n\nCHAPTER 5  **\nCOUNSELS AND PRAYERS  **\n 5.1 Counsel To You On Patience  **\nProverbs 4 verse 1,2  **\n 1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.    **\n2\tFor I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.  **\n\nBuy faith and patience - Do not go with faith only, if not, you will be hopping. Go with patience too. Patience is indispensable in the exercise of faith in one's life.  **\nApply faith and patience - Do not take faith only. Wait, because, faith needs patience to be complete in your case. Wait, because, faith has time and requires patience.  **\n Persevere in faith and patience - Keep on praying and keep on waiting. Accumulate power. Just keep on praying and be accumulating energy. When the tears fill your bottle, there shall be explosion.  **\n\nPsalms. 56 verse 8  **\n“Thou tellest my wanderings; put Thou my tears into Thy bottle are they not in Thy book?”  **\n\n\n5.2 Prayers for You  **\n Romans 15 verse 4 to 6  **\n4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. \n5\tNow the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus; \n6\tThat ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  **\nI pray the Lord will increase patience in your life! The degree of patience shall increase in your life! The amount of patience shall increase in your life, and then you will become an achiever. Satan will not defeat you with time. May God reward your faith and patience.  **\nThrough faith and patience you will be healed. Through faith and patience, your deliverance will be sure. That evil dream troubling you, about which you have been praying, will be gone. Wait for the time of action when the Lord shall rise up, that dream shall cease! Do not feel as though you are being mocked by the devil because you have prayed and are yet to see the answer. Pray and wait. That invocation of the name of Jesus shall suddenly explode one day and the enemy shall not survive it.   **\n Through faith and patience, you will marry. Through faith and patience, woman, you will give birth to a child. For this child I prayed, then I waited and then the Lord gave it to me. The Lord will do it for you as He did it for Sarah and Elizabeth.  **\nFirst Samuel 1 verse 27  **\n“For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of Him ” Through faith and patience, you shall have prosperity. The job or work to do will come. You shall have the desired connections come to you. The Lord shall lift you up! The Lord shall promote you. He shall settle your situation; He shall take you there and make you sit upon the throne. All the mockery they have made of you will be turned to praises. \nThrough faith and patience, the ugly situation in your life shall surrender. That ugly situation bringing tears and shame to you, will surrender. Just wait. He brought me up out of a horrible pit…You are coming out of that place! The Lord shall bring you out of that place or ugly situation. By the power of the Lord, I decree that that sickness shall vanish from your life in the name of Jesus! \nJust wait for it. When Jesus cursed the fig tree, it was the following day they saw it dry up, but the curse had been released the day before. The curse over that problem in your life has been released; wait for it, those leaves and that tree (problems) shall dry. Because the word of God has been spoken and it cannot return void, that problem shall be settled    **\nIsaiah 55 verse 10, 11   **\n10For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater  \n11\tSo shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth it shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.  **\nThe Lord has said, 'let there be light,' so, light will come up in your life! Healing will come up in your life because the Lord has sent His word of healing. \nHe sent forth His word and healed the people and delivered them from all their destruction (Palms. 107 verse 20), therefore your deliverance is coming! The Lord has sent forth a word to renew your strength, and your strength shall be renewed. He will renew your youth as the eagle’s. The vehicle bringing you the fulfillment has taken off and will reach you! Though it tarry, wait for it; it shall be done!   **\nCongratulations, you are going to see it in your life. For God is not a man that He should lie. Your prayer has entered the register of God. A date has been put on it and it shall materialize at the right time.  **\nNumbers 23 verse 19    **\n19 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent, hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?    **\nPeople are praying for your situation and God has heard their prayers. Angels are coming on the way! Whatever delays Angel Gabriel, don't worry, because by the 21 day, he will arrive in your life and the blessings of the Lord shall come! Rejoice! Your life will change for better. The cloth of the prodigal son shall be removed and the cloth of righteousness shall be put upon you. Blessing and freedom is upon your life. Your door has been opened! The Lord has decreed success over your life. Your duty (or all you have to do) is to believe God, and that thing shall be realized, your ministry shall grow and anointing shall take over your life in the name of Jesus!\n",

      "body": "GOD'S HEALING FOR HIS CHILDREN THROUGH FAITH AND THE USE OF MEDICINE  **\n\nINTRODUCTION  **\nThis book, “GOD'S HEALING FOR HIS CHILDREN THROUGH FAITH AND THE USE OF \nMEDICINE,” is one among the fifty Christian literature I have written to feed Christ's believers with knowledge and understanding of Biblical truth for their righteousness, peace and eternal life. The book shows through the scriptures that divine healing through faith in God's word and the name of Jesus is one of the ways God heals the sick and delivers the oppressed. The book shows through the scriptures that God also heals through the use of medicines, conventional or herbal. It is not according to scripture to ban the use of medicine by Christians as is done in some denominational churches.\nMany people in the churches of Christ who profess \nChristianity are not really Christians; they still live in sin. To ask such ones not to receive medical treatment but use faith only, is to direct them to a God that does not know them and a God they do not know to receive blessing from Him. They are not children of God.\nAgain, some in the church who are believers may not be able to generate faith in time of ill health. They cannot be forced to do so. The all-wise God provided alternative way to deliver His people from perishing due to lack of faith for divine healing. These are able to exercise faith in God to heal them as they receive medical treatment. \nLet every man operate according to the measure of faith he has on God. Getting healing from God by faith does not guarantee eternal life.  **\nRomans 12 verse 3  **\n“For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.”   **\nGetting healing through the use of medicine does not disqualify the Christian of eternal life. This book makes things plain scripturally.  **\nRomans 14 verse 1 to 4, 22  **\n1\tHim that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.  \n2\tFor one believeth that he may eat all things another, who is weak, eateth herbs.  \n3\tLet not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth;  for God hath received him.  \nWho art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up  for God is able to make him stand.\n22 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.   **\n\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE  **\nMINISTERING TO OTHERS AND \nNEGLECTING YOURSELF  **\n1.1 Let Your Spirit, Soul and Body Be Preserved\n      Blameless  **\t \t \nGod created humans with three parts  the spirit, the soul and the body. The three are separate entities but exist as one. Each part has to be taken good care of for one to live well here on earth and in eternity. It is very essential therefore that you care well for your spirit, soul and body.  **\n1 Thessalonians 5 verse 22 to 24  **\n22\tAbstain from all appearance of evil. \n23\tAnd the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. \n24\tFaithful is He that calleth you, Who also will do it.  **\nThe three persons in a man - the spirit, the soul and the body, should be well cared for and be well preserved. It is the responsibility of God to preserve you blameless to the end. It is God's responsibility and it is also your responsibility. If you do your own part well, God will surely do His own. It is a covenant. It is an agreement between God and you. God will do His own part because He is faithful, but you too must play your own role. It is a dual responsibility. It is the desire of God that we should be spiritually fruitful, holy and healthy.  **\nThird John 1 to 2  **\n1\tThe elder unto the well-beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth. \n2\tBeloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.  **\nThe prosperity, soundness and the wellbeing of the whole man in spirit, soul and body is what God desires for you. Brethren, desire this also for your fellow ones in Christ. \nDesire their soundness in spirit, soul and body.  **\n1.2 The Spirit and The Soul  **\nThe spirit and the soul form the spiritual man, which we do not see. What we see is the physical body. We cannot touch our spirit or our soul, and very often, the spirit and the soul are joined very tightly together. The Bible says that it is the word of God that can separate between the two, but what we see is the body.  **\nHebrews 4 verse 12    **  \n“For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of  the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the  thoughts and intents of the heart.”  **\nWe should wish for the wellbeing of our brothers and sisters (the brethren). Wish for the wellbeing of the members of your Church. Apostle Paul said, I have not shunned to present unto you all that is profitable to you, because I desire your wellbeing. I desire your spiritual welfare. I desire your bodily welfare also, that you may prosper in health. You need it, you should be healthy in the body. If you are not healthy, how will you carry out the work of God?\nAgain he said, I pray God, your spirit, soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord. See how he wished you continue in wellbeing to the end, until the Lord comes for you, either at death or in the rapture. He wishes that you carry your ministry to the end. You need preservation and this preservation is for your body, spirit and soul. God desires that those who minister to others in the gospel should also minister to themselves, so that they may be first partakers in the benefits of the gospel. The ministers should take care of themselves because God wants full and lasting service. This will happen when we take care of ourselves spiritually and physically.  **\n\n\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 6   **\n“The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.”   **\nThe Lord is concerned about your spirit, soul and body. Make sure that you take care of your physical body well. Make sure that you take care of your spiritual life well. Why is this counsel necessary? It is because many Christian workers and ministers do not take care of their wellbeing. They neglect themselves. They are busy working for others and neglect their own lives.   **\n1.3 The Implication(s) of Ministering to Others and Neglecting Yourself  **\nSong of Solomon 1 verse 6   **\n“Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me, my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.”   **\n\nBusy man! Busy woman! See this woman, she was not black before. She was light in complexion, but now she says, I have become black and shame has come upon me. That is why she said, Oh no, do not look upon me. She is hiding herself now. What brought this blackness on her? She said she had been busy under the sun, working, doing this work and doing that work. I have been busy in the kitchen. I have been busy in the house. I have been busy in the market. I have been busy working up and down. But what kept you busy? Human beings- My mother's children, kept me busy. I was busy serving them. I was busy serving others.  **\nYou are busy serving others in the Church. You are busy serving others in your Ministry. You are busy serving others in Holiness Revival Movement. Good as it is, but see what she revealed - They made me keeper of the vineyards. Vineyards in plural. This person's vineyard, that person's vineyard; I go here, I go there, to please them, because they are getting angry with me. I am running dry so as to keep other people peaceful. “My own vineyard” (I had one for myself), I have not kept. “Their own,” Yes, I am busy going after their own, but my own vineyard I have not kept. See me now, I am  black. The sun has looked down upon me. Why? Going up and down, caring for people's vineyards, but not my own!\nYou have a soul and you have a spirit. You are a Pastor. You have a spirit that cries because he is spiritually hungry. He is crying. Listen to the voice and the cry of your spirit longing for the fullness of God.  **\nPsalms 42 verse 1 ,2    **\n1\tAs the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God.\n2\tMy soul thirsteth for God, for the living God  \nwhen shall I come and appear before God?\nYour spirit is crying. Hear what it is saying in verse 1  As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God. Verses 2; My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God  when shall I come and appear before God?   **\nThat is the cry of your soul, but you are busy going up and down. You have a soul that can die because of sin; for the soul that sinneth, it shall die. That soul that you are starving shall die! That soul that you are not feeding is your own vineyard. Your soul is crying, yet, as a preacher, you are not giving it attention. As a preacher, in fact, people testify of your service, they are no more angry with you. They testify how nice you are, but your soul is not cared for and he is crying for genuine and eternal salvation. You must listen and attend to the cry.  **\n1.4  The Law of  Sowing And Reaping  **\nGalatians 6 verse 7, 8   **\n7\tBe not deceived; God is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. \n8\tFor he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.  **\nThere are laws in this life. God will not change the laws for you, except in His perfect wisdom, where it is required for His glory, which is not often like that. There are formulas in life. Now that you did not keep your vineyard, what has happened to it?  **\nSong of Solomon 2 verse 15   **\n“Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes.”   **\nFoxes have come over your vineyard. Nobody is there to care for your vineyard. Little by little, your tender grapes are being spoiled. Your tender and fresh Christian life is being spoiled. Your true spiritual peace is now in turbulences. It is not cared for. You have left yourself slovenly for long. It is disfiguring your face. What happened? You do not have time! You have not trimmed your fingernails. We can see dirt inside them and people are saying, “what happened to this one? Why is it like this?” You do not have time. Foxes have taken over your life. Little, foxes and the tenderness of the Christian life has been destroyed. Anger has now come in. Why will anger not come? It is a natural law. Nature abhors a vacuum. Something must happen when a required action is neglected.   **\nAnger came because the soul was not fed. That is why you can now be angry. Lusting came in. They are the foxes. Why will they not come? You are dealing with women around you, with men around you. What will hinder you from lusting? Ask me, what kept Peter from sinking in the sea when Jesus bid him come? His eyes were towards Jesus, but when his eyes looked outside Jesus, what happened to him? He began to sink. It is a natural law. The lust that is coming into your heart is a natural law. It is because you do not care for your heart.\nYou are not giving the heart what is required to keep it clean.  ** \nPsalms 119 verse 11   **\n“Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against Thee”   **\n Did you take time to put the word of God into your heart today? Do you have the time? When you wake up in the morning, do you read the Bible? Those messages that you used to listen to before, do you listen to them again? It is a natural law. When dry season sets in, the stones in the riverbed will be seen, because the waters have dried up. Why? Rain has stopped. Your own rain has stopped, that is why the dryness you experience now takes over. Little foxes!\n \nYou are not strong, but you are still actively working. Even when Saul left the Lord, was he not still king? You are still serving. The gifts of God are without repentance. You are still demonstrating gifts. Pride now comes in. you are even surprised yourself. Your speech now has some dirty words in it. Why? The inside does not have a cleanser. How will you be clean? Now ye are clean through the word that I have spoken unto you. Which word have you heard from Jesus? None! Why will polluted words not come out of you? Why will lies, particles of lies not be seen around you? It is natural. It is a natural formula. Hey! Your case is serious because you are considered a man of God. You are a woman of God respected seriously in Christ, but you know you are dirty inside.  **\nEcclesiastes 10 verse 1   **\n“Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.”   **\nThat is why the Bible says you should be perfect. With all this reputation you have made, with all this honour, to see sin in your life? People who knew you before and see your life now will shake their heads. A woman may even say, “I stood by Pastor, but the way Pastor was looking at me, Hmmmm! It is like those other men ooo.” What has happened? Pastor is no more praying. Go and ask him, when last did he fast? When last did Pastor fast? Go and ask him. When did he sit down to read the scriptures? Go and ask Pastor. That is why even Pastor himself was surprised the way he started looking at women lustfully. Pastor himself was afraid. How will he not do that? There is no spiritual strength in his life.  **\n1.5 Many Men Of God Have No Time To Minister To Themselves   **\nYour own vineyard, you are not keeping. That is why the Lord is telling you to take care of yourself. Care well for your spirit and soul. The water is hot because there is fire under it. But if the fire be quenched, the heat will keep reducing per second. Many are employed or recruited into ministry and work tirelessly, ministering to others. They receive commendation as faithful servants, but neglect to care for themselves. The result is little foxes coming in to destroy their righteousness and holiness before God and man. They engage themselves as teachers of God's word, teaching others fervently, but they do not have time to teach themselves.  **\nRomans 2 verse 17 to 24  **\n17\tBehold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, \n18\tAnd knowest His will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law; \n19\tAnd art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law. \n20\tThou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal? \n21\tThou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege? \n22\tThou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God? \n23\tFor the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.   **\nIs that your state now? You have the form of knowledge. You know the doctrine. You know the Bible. You know the verses and the interpretations. Solomon said, “My wisdom still remained with me. Although backslidden, my wisdom still remained with me.” You still have this knowledge. In fact, you still know how to cast out devils. You know the language to speak. You know how to become serious when the matter involves devils. You know what to say. You know how to counsel others, but what is happening to you? Why are you doing the things that you preach against? You are not caring for  yourself. You abandoned your vineyard. Thou that teachest others, teachest not thyself? \nYou interpret scriptures well to people who do not know, so you are giving them correct knowledge, but as for you, are you applying these scriptural truth to yourself? Sit down and preach to yourself. The prodigal son had already known what it means by going back home. He knew the road. All he needed to do was rise up and follow the road back home. You know the road but you are not following it. It is bad. You are not doing well to yourself. Sister, how do you allow the kitchen to take over your life? Do not complain, Martha! You should not be talking about kitchen work. Let there be fasting in that house for at least three days so that you can have time for your soul. Members of the family, if the Lord asks you to fast for three days so that your mother will go to heaven, will you not fast?   **\n1.6 Value Soul-nourishment Above Body-nourishment.    **\nLuke 10 verse 40 to 42    **\n40\tBut Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to Him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. \n41\tAnd Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things; \n42\tBut one thing is needful and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.   **\nWho told you that life must be only about food? Have you not thought this out by yourself? If you ask God for wisdom, He will give you. If you can negotiate well with your family, you will create time for yourself to pray and seek the Lord. But how did you come to this point? How art thou fallen from heaven? How? That you have become like this? Fighting, speaking lies and uttering corrupt communication. Your anger is like a lion or a lioness. How did you come to that point? It is because you neglected yourself. You kept other people's vineyards, but your vineyard, you never kept. Folly has come to you, that even your service is an abomination.  **\nFirst Corinthians 13 verse 1 to 3  **\n1\tThough I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.\n2\t And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. \n3\tAnd though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.   **\nA little dead fly in the oil of the apothecary does much harm. The sweet fragrance of the oil is destroyed when there is a dead fly in it. The oil will smell foully. Your spiritual oil smells. People will want to remove their eyes and hold their nose at you. Beautiful oil smelling! Why? You are not caring for yourself and folly has come upon you.  **\nHosea 7 verse  8 to 9  **\n8\tEphraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned. \n9\tStrangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.  **\nCan you see? How did it happen like that? He mixed himself with the people. You are having friends who are not Christians. You are having friends who do not have Christian vision. You sit down from morning to afternoon, talk and laugh, until your strength is gone. The next thing is to go and sleep. O sleeper! And when you sleep, Ooooh! You have laboured in talk, you have laboured to laugh, you will sleep deeply. You have mixed yourself with the people. You have gone to join society people who do not have Jesus coming for them, who are not commissioned by God to do any service for Him, who do not know anything about holy living. They are the people that have kept you occupied. You have gone to do business with them. You are now seeking money like the people. Everyone is running for money. You have joined them. So, as a result, grey hair is here and there. The lower side of you is Christian, but the upper part of you is not Christian. It is a cake not turned. The underneath is done, but the upper side is not done, because it is not turned. That is Ephraim! It is a cake not turned. Strangers have devoured his strength. You know the strangers. The strangers you brought to yourself, that have now devoured your strength. Brother, you know them. As for our iniquities, we know them. Our sins and our transgressions are not hid before us.  **\n 1.7 Be Not A Hypocrite In God's Service  **\nAgain, this is what God wants you to know. You are now struggling. What are you struggling to do?  **\nMatthew 7 verse 3 to 5  **\n3\tAnd why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? \n4\tOr how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? \n     5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of  thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.  **\nThat is what you are doing now. Why beholdest thou the mote in other people's eyes? You are now treating others. You are going for Crusade! To go and say what? What are you going to tell the people in the Crusade? I will tell them to repent and believe in Jesus! What about your immoral lifestyle? What about your rough life? See the way you treat your wife!  Rough. Angry. Will you not repent? You are going to ask another innocent man over there to repent. You are going to ask another man, who may be better than you to repent, and you are not one of those to repent! You are just struggling.  **\nMatthew 7 verse 4,5    **\n4\tOr how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? \n5\tThou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.  **\nDo you know that you are a hypocrite? How many people really know that they are hypocrites?  You may say you are not, but Jesus says you are. You have a bigger problem because, to him that knows his Master's will and doeth it not, he shall be beaten with many stripes. You know your Master's will, you know your Master's word. You know that your Master wants you to talk to Him. You even know that your Master wants to speak to you, but you have no time for Him. Busy on other things. No time! Oh, brother, care for your spirit and soul.  **\n1.8 Christian Programs Are Meant To Minister To You.  **\nHebrews 10 verse 25   **\n“Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another and so much more, as ye see the day approaching.”  **\nFirst Thessalonians 5 verse 11   **\n“Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.”  **\nLuke 6 verse 31   **\n“And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.”  ** \nDuring conferences, you prefer to travel out. Are you part of those going to heaven? What shall it profit you if you gain the whole world and lose your own soul? Have priority in life and know how to set your priorities right. \nChristian programmes; fellowships and conferences are to feed your soul. Other people's vineyards you have kept, but your own vineyard you have not kept. You neglect attending fellowship, conferences and other programmes organized to minister to you because you are not going to be one of the preachers. You have programmed yourself to be only a preaching Christian, not to be preached to, not to listen to others, not to read other writers' books. How then can you see the grey hairs on you which you are unaware of? You are frustrating your soul. You are not seeing vision for heaven. You need to set your priorities right. You need to know how to give honour to God. Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's. Know that God is infinitely higher than Caesar. This is the time for God but you are not giving it to Him? How would you not be black inside? Other people's vineyard you have kept, for your own vineyard, no time. \nYou are not listening to other true servants of God sent to you. You may be denominationally bound and ruined through ignorance. Humble yourself and receive divine rebuke and wisdom. Whenever you attend programmes, you complain of the message and preacher, and not willing to humble and listen as Jesus did.  **\nLuke 2 verse 46    **\n“And it came to pass, that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.”    **\nIt is better at this time, to receive than to give. Train yourself to sit down and listen to God's word. As a Pastor, you give books and recorded messages to others for their edification, but you do not sit to listen yourself. You are keeping other people's vineyards, but not your own vineyard. No! Do you know that sitting alone to listen to or watch a message, and joining a congregation in a service when much prayer has been prayed to water the ground, and bind the devil and plead for the presence of God are two different things? But you do not want to join the congregation in a conference. That is why you are black in your heart, and God Who knows that you are not serious does not concern Himself with you. He knows that you are not serious. Go to the ants, thou sluggard. Go and learn their ways and be wise; who having no guide, nor overseer, do what will keep them living. Because nobody is there in your church, you are the one there and no one is monitoring you there, so you do whatever you want? You come to Church the time you want, and sit where you want, giving the flesh its own ease? Be warned! ** **\n\nCHAPTER TWO  **\nTAKE GOOD SPIRITUAL CARE OF YOUR SPIRIT AND SOUL  **\n2.1 What You Need.  **\nSecond Corinthians 8 verse 1 to 5  **\n1\tMoreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia; \n2\tHow that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. \n3\tFor to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; \n4\tPraying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. \n5\tAnd this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.   **\nRead verse 5 again- And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.\nYou have been told that as far as matters of heaven are concerned, for your individual life, it is better to receive than to give. But if it is matter of money or material things, it is better to give than to receive. For spiritual  things, it is better to receive than to give. Look at these people; they supported Paul even in their state of poverty. They first gave themselves to God. They cared first for their spiritual lives; and this they did.  **\n2.2 First Give Yourself To The Lord.   **\nThe people first gave themselves to the Lord. Preachers, let us learn to first give ourselves to the Lord. Let us learn to first seek the Lord for ourselves. Let us learn to first receive spiritual warmth of the Lord for ourselves. Let us learn to first have fellowship with the Lord for ourselves, then we can go for service and preaching. 'They first gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us for the ministry.’\nThe Macedonian believers were zealous for the work of God. They provided support for the work of the ministry. Paul's testimony was that these people first gave their own lives to Christ, and in a daily way, committed themselves to the Lord, and then to the ministry of Paul with evidence. Before rendering service, repentance and salvation from sin through faith in Christ is required from you. As you feed others in Christian service, remember to feed your soul and to feed your spirit with the word of God.  **\nMatthew 4 verse 4    **\n“But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”    **\nRead the Bible, it is every word of God. First feed on it and live by it; every word of God. Read the Bible and read the revelations of God there, they are the words of God. I mean true and proved revelations.  **\nRevelation 1 verse 1 to 3    **\n1\tThe Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass; and He sent and signified it by His angel unto His servant John;\n2\tWho bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. \n3\tBlessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein  for the time is at hand.    **\nKnowledge grows. I write to you now, after some time, when you sit down to read this book again, you will wonder whether you have read it before. The word of God cannot be exhausted, for they are new every morning. That is it. Study the word, go back there and study the word over and over again. \nRead Christian books. God has given them. Do not be tired of them. Ah! Why are we reading Pastor Paul Rika's books every day? That is the language of the mixed multitude. They are tired with manna, divine food from heaven! They are looking for the one from Egypt. They are looking for prosperity preachers. They are looking for these other preachers too. As for this manna that God Himself gives, they said, 'We are tired with this manna'. That is the voice of a backslider. The Lord is the One Who gave you these messages. The Lord is the One that organizes this Holiness Revival Movement and puts you in Zones, Chapters and Units. You should be reading and listening to these messages. He sent them. Do not get tired of them. Do not disdain them as the backslidden children of Israel disdained the manna from heaven.  Renew yourself by them. Let them refresh you.  **\n2.3 Pressurize Yourself And Others On Spiritual Matters   **\nEach word of God lives forever.   **\nPsalms 119 verse 89   **\n“Forever O LORD Thy word is settled in heaven.”    **\nIf you become tired with the Bible, what would you do? Do you want now to read Koran or the 7 books of Moses? If you say that you are tired with the Bible, then you are tired with God. Rebuke that flesh in your life and be spiritually minded. Care well for your spirit and for your soul. Observe your Quiet Time with God. Take enough time to be with God. If you are too busy in the morning, create time in another period. Even in your office, you can create time there. If you desire so, God will help you. \nI remember when I was an office worker, how I would trek for a long distance, to and fro, praying on the way, because I could not pray in the office. I made prayer walk; by the time I reached there and prayed back, I had gotten some good prayer time during office hour. That was wisdom. Do all you can to save yourself. Make personal spiritual commitments. I also remember one time, I said to myself that I would listen to four DVD messages per day for one week. That commitment was heavy. It took me up to 12 midnight. It made me discipline myself to stand up long to ensure that I did not sleep. Because, apart from other busy things in life, I had committed myself to it. Like Jephthah, Oh! I had made commitment and I could not retreat. I listened to 28 messages in one week. Go and make similar commitment; try your best.    **\nThe Lord told me to give leaders and members of Holiness Revival Movement spiritual assignments. As they are finishing this, I should give them another one. Do not play with them. Take them seriously. 'I have given them over to you to lead them to heaven.' Are you lazy about the assignments? The wisdom of God is playing on you, do not resist the spirit of wisdom. Are you ready to go to heaven? We follow up on the assignments. Do not give God excuses for not doing these assignments designed to help you against sin and Satan. If you cannot do that which will keep you as a leader spiritually strong, then how do you feed the people? God said that I should give you that assignment. Do not think you are doing it for me. You are doing it for God. He will judge you for it, if you are playing laziness. We do not have time to waste. Our fathers have wasted enough of the time, and the Lord is already coming. So, whatever spiritual assignment He has given to you, rise up and do it. He is patient with you, but do not default.  **\nYour human nature is weak, that is why we are giving you a push. Plan out your prayer time. Observe fasting and vigils. Join others in spiritual activities and exercises. Leaders, when the members of your Church are praying, join them. Do not go to sit in the office. What are you doing in the office? Are you the only one that can sleep? Are you the only one that is tired? Do you know where those members came from? Why are you pressurizing them for heaven, whereas you distance yourself and avoiding the fatigue? Know that God sees you! Go right among them and suffer it also as they are suffering; for they are human beings like you. Go among them and force yourself to pray. If you feel you may doze off, go and doze off before them, they will understand. As you are giving them reasons why they should not doze off, give yourself the same reasons too. Practice those things that will make you not to doze off. Pray! The Lord told me, “When people are praying, make sure you join them, you and your wife.” Do not play hypocrisy like others. Do not push others to God and stay behind; the Lord is watching. 'It is not the amount of prayer that you pray, it is God that shows mercy, says some lazy Christians.' How will He show you mercy, if He judges you unfaithful? God wants you to labour in prayer so that He will give you the reward. Manage your family spiritually well. Give them a push toward God.  **\n2.4 Condition(s) for Getting God's Promises Fulfilled.    **\n \nGenesis 18 verse 17 to 19   **\n17\tAnd the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; \n18\tSeeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? \n19\tFor I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.    **\nHas God spoken well of you concerning what He will do? Is God assuring you of some wonderful future? He said, “I know Abraham, his family, his children, his household.” If you submit yourself to your wife and allow her to rule you, your ministry is gone and you have no reason to offer as to why you failed. What are you going to tell God? He said that you should command. He put authority in Abraham, to command them. For what? Command them for spirituality in that house. It is required for your own ministerial progress. Your ministerial progress is more than the food that your wife gives you. If she is giving you food because she wants you to live, she should submit to your spiritual authority in that house, so that you will also live spiritually and 'ministerially.' Teach them the word, bring them to devotion in that family - children, wife, and all that are there. Command them to obey and follow the Lord for God's blessings upon you.  **\n2.5 Pastors Wives' Demon.  ** \nPastors' wives! There are demons called, Pastors wives' demons. When these demons come to the Church, they are only interested in Pastors' wives  to make them come late, to make them sit at the back or under a tree. To make them stand up and move about carelessly, sleep or be absent. Pastors wives' demon. Examine every Pastor's wife whether they have demons! What are the signs? Spirit of late coming and spirit of busy here and there. As thy servant was busy here and there, the spiritual life was gone. “Martha! Martha! You are troubled over many things, but one thing is needful, Mary has chosen it, and it shall never be taken away from her. You are busy saying, “Master, eat food. In fact, the reason for being busy is to take care of you.” Jesus fasted for 40 days. Why give attention to food than spirituality? Why did you not wake up early? You need to plan your way and create time for God in your life. Why are you not doing so? Now you are bringing blasphemy to the ministry of your husband. You are rendering your husband weak in the pulpit. God will hold you responsible! Both God and devils are over you. God wants to win you, because if He succeeds in you, your husband will have a blessed future in ministry as He told Abraham. Otherwise, your ministry among women, all the smiles you put on your face and the friendship you think you are making with women shall never last, \nbecause real spirituality is the state of your heart. You do  not read or study God's word, you do not have to pray to receive God's grace for His service because you have no time. Others' vineyards you have kept, your own vineyard you have not kept.  **\n2.6 Leaders, Care For Your Wives.   **\n The wives of some ministers neglect fellowship or church services, special programs or conferences. They do not bother to attend meetings that will edify them. They behave as unbelievers and are unconcerned about God and their souls. But you say that she is a believer, and she is not coming for believers' fellowship! What reasons can you give for her regular absence? If you give us a reason today, we may say, okay, maybe that is what made her not to come today. What reason can you give for her absence tomorrow since it has become a character? We expect her to find a solution. Otherwise, is your wife more occupied than these other women? Is your wife having more children than other women? Why is she backward? Is it not because of Pastors wives' demon?\nBetter take care of your wife. Use authority and command. Help her in any area that she needs help. Do all that is required to help her spiritually. Do not lose that soul. The Lord shall ask you of her. If you try your best and fail, then like John Wesley, let the Lord be witness. God wants you and your wife to exercise godliness together.  **\nFirst Timothy 3 verse 1 to 7  **\n1\tThis is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. \n2\tA bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; \n3\tNot given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; \n4\tOne that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; \n5\t(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of \nGod?) \n6\tNot a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil. \n7\tMoreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.  **\nWives of Christian leaders are expected to be righteous and holy and to be under the control of their husbands. Pastors' wives, please do not bring blemish to the ministry. Do not behave contrary in your houses over this special calling that the Lord gave you and your husband, otherwise it will be terrible for you before God. Do not be a master of yourself, you are under your husband and the Lord has asked him to command you to do that which is spiritually right in His sight. Submit to him at home and also submit to him in the ministry. Do not be a perpetual late comer. \nIf you come late today for any reason, there can be real reasons, but work against lateness next time. Train your children to come early to church. If you need to delegate duties to others, do so. The brethren want to see you early in Church and to every meeting. You have been warned that your name may be removed from the Book of Life or may not even enter there if you are not righteous and holy. Love holiness. Join your husband in the work. Care well for the family. Make the family conducive for the Christian ministry. Let the two of you care well for the children to make them love God.  ** **\n\n\nCHAPTER THREE  **\nCARE WELL FOR YOUR PHYSICAL BODY  **\n \n3.1 The Physical Body Should Also Be Preserved Blameless.  **\nFirst Thessalonians 5 verse 23   **\n “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”  **\n\nYour physical body, that is your flesh, is the one that covers you. Touch your body to know and understand what this means. Your physical body is indispensable. Praise the Lord for it. The Bible says that you should preserve that body. God is willing to get that body preserved. Many people have died before their time because they did not care for the body. They never gave attention to the wellbeing of their body. God is interested that your body be preserved blameless, without sickness, damage or any condition that can make it prevent your soul and spirit from giving God full worship and service. A damaged or sickly body can make you die early or inhibit you spiritually.  **\n\n3.2 Nourish and Cherish Your Body.  ** \nEphesians 5 verse 29  **\n“For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church ”    **\n\nDo not hate your body. Do not do any evil to that body. Nourish that body and feed it well. Feed your body with good food and anything that is good to the body to make it healthy, to make it sound, to remove pain and sickness from it, take it and keep your body healthy. Prosper in health, cherish that body and nourish it. Do not be careless over it. Do not expose that body to danger. Do not expose that body to damage. Keep it well. Keep it healthy. God wants it so. Although the spirit is the one that gets born again; for a living in this world, that body is essential. It can end up the activity of your spirit and send your spirit and soul back to eternity, if you do not care for it well. Please care for your body because life is in the blood. Your body contains your life on earth.  ** \n\n3.3 Your Body Is a Building.   ** \n\nThe main person in that building is yourself, but the building is important because it plays its own role, otherwise how will you be hidden from the sun? How will you be sheltered from the wind and the rain? How will you be protected from evil workers and evil men? How will you have real rest without a house? Your body is your house. If you get that body damaged, it will affect your inner parts and the enemy may take occasion of it to affect your spirituality. That is why some thieves, when they want to enter in to operate against you, they have to break through the house, and some will dig from outside and dig down the wall of the house. So, be very careful and watch over your body. That is why some have watchmen over their houses. A big man living inside his house employs watchmen to watch over the house. Actually, they are not watching over the house but watching over him and the family members or other inhabitants in the house because, if the enemies break through the house, they will have access to them. Your body may inhibit some spiritual activities in your life or may even terminate your life on earth. Hence, you are required by God to take care of your body. \n\nYou need to have knowledge of things and ways required to preserve your body. Knowledge has increased, that is why we want you to understand the place of medicines in the maintenance of your body as a holy believer in order to live well and sound all the time, for a prolonged life and service to God on this earth.  **\n\n Proverbs 3 verse 13 to 24  **\n13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. \n14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. \n15 She is more precious than rubies and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. \n16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.  17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\n18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy is every one that retaineth her. \n19 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens. \n20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. \n21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes, keep sound wisdom and discretion;\n22\tso shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.\n23Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. 24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.  **\n\nIf you have a disturbing stomach that has not left you with all your prayers and others praying for you, and you do not take medicine to arrest it in your body, you will not be able to rise or stand in the pulpit with biting or stomach ache. You will want to go and lie down flat on your belly. You will not be able to do anything because your body has been affected. What if an accident happens and they have to amputate your leg? Brother, automatically, many things about the gospel will be limited in your life. What if you were to lose your eyes, because of the cataract coming up in your eyes which you have not bothered to go for medical treatment? Your usefulness in life will be limited. What if you lose your teeth? Is it a good thing when somebody stands speaking and the teeth are not in order? Only a limited number of people would like to listen to you. Some people can easily be irritated by even little inordinate things or appearance. You will by that reduce the number of the congregation that will hear you. Take care of that body. Keep it well. Do that which is just and right to keep it perfect.  **\n\n3.4 Feed Your Body with Good Food and Proper Drinks.    ** \n\nFeed your body with appropriate food for your good health. Be careful with fasting. Control your fasting. Let your moderation be known to all men. That is the word of God. Do not engage in careless fasting. Do not be so power-driven to the point of destroying your body. There are formulas to everything in life. Whatever a man sows, he shall reap. Subject that body to an unfavourable condition and you shall reap. A particular pastor said, he had finished all his fasting! I asked him how he has finished his fasting. He explained that he went on marathon fast as a young preacher until stomach ulcer caught him, and so for that he has finished all his fasting! Have demons also finished their work? Why did you finish your fasting so early? Have problems of life finished? Let your moderation be known to all men.  **\n\nActs 27 verse 33 to 36  **\n33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.\n34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat for this is for your health; for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.\n35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all, and when he had broken it, he began to eat. \n36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.  **\n\n Paul said, eating was required for their health. If you always starve your body, you will reap the consequence at your later end. Some people may have accident today without feeling the pain until after 40 years or much more later, when they go to the doctor to make complaints, and the doctor begins to ask, 'Have you ever had an accident? The accident you had many years ago is what is manifesting now in your body'. Oh! If you had been wise at that time, you would not have neglected that matter. If you had treated yourself well then, the present challenge would not have come. \n\nDo you know that if you do not take care of your body today, it might be the reason for your backsliding tomorrow? Some sicknesses may come on some people so painful that they start abusing God. Is it not because of Job's sickness that the wife said, “Curse God and die?” Although we are aware that Job was not sick because he was careless, but it concerned his body. If Job was not committed, the case of his sickness was enough to make him angry with God. What are you doing in this your early years to care for your body? Are you waiting for when you will become older and the body takes another shape because of the way you treated it yesteryears? Will you not then say, “God, I have laboured for You, why did You allow this?” Remember that whatever a man sows, he will reap. You did not sow well to your body, that is why you are reaping that; and now you want to put the blame on God? Did you not hear His word? My people perish for lack of knowledge.   **\n\nAvoid risky businesses that will bring ill health to your body and affect your performance later in life. There are some businesses that will give you asthma. It may not show in your body now, but later it will show and will make you want to blame God over your impaired health and inabilities. Check it up now. Study! Take time to listen; be fast to hear. When we are teaching on these health tips, do not say that you have no need of them or that you have strong faith in God. There is the place of faith and there is the place for knowledge. Add to your faith, knowledge. You need it. Let there be moderation or self-control in everything.  **\n\nSecond Peter 1 verse5  **\n“ And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;”    **\n \nThe drunkards are told that their stomach ulcer came as a result of their excessive alcohol intake. Have you heard so? The smokers are told that the cancer of their lungs came as a result of the smoke they sent into it. Check your habits; your eating habits. Are you over-eating one thing? Find out whether there is implication, although you love it.  **\n\n 3.5 Jesus Taught His Disciples to Rest    **\n Let your moderation be known to all men. Have selfcontrol and temperance. Give the body rest after a long hard work. Jesus taught His disciples this.   **\n\nMark 6 verse 30 to 32    **\n30 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told Him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.\n31 And He said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.\n32 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.   **\n\n Praise be to God for what the Holy Spirit is teaching us. You are going to be fruitful. You are going to be prosperous. He that knows the truth shall be set free. Your future is certain. The poison waiting for you in the future has been removed. The truth shall make you free. Are you just coming from a duty? Take time to rest. The rest may not be too long at a time, but you need rest. Look at what the Bible says  'leisure.' It means, doing something that will give your heart relaxation, which will give your mind joy and peace. Some may just go to sit by a river and be watching as the water flows. That is leisure. You left preaching? You did not go for evangelism; someone may ask? I returned from evangelism and I want to recover. That is why I am sitting by this river to watch the creation of God. I take delight in watching the creation of God and it gives me leisure; is your reply to him. That is what the Lord expects of you. Be free to do that; or else, you go and sit in a garden, beside the flowers and take leisure. For some, there may be a beautiful rug in their house, they just lie on the rug leisurely and be relaxing. He is happy. Some go to sit under the air conditioner to enjoy the cold air. It is leisure. Some have some good things to watch that excite them. It is leisure. Everybody has that which interests him, as far as such things are not sinful. You need it to recover, to refresh. Of course, you can have a chat too or a talk with someone. It is leisure. “All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy”. Constant work without rest or relaxation is truly harmful to one's personal life and wellbeing. This information is helpful, so that when a person is on leisure, he will not be seen as wasting the time. You may come into somebody's house and see beautiful Cushion chairs and the way he decorated the house with flowers and other things of beauty. Do not say, Hey! “People can waste the money of God''. God has given us freely all things to enjoy. The person watching those things gets leisure to enable him recover and go back to work. There is no sin or iniquity in doing so.  **\n\nFirst Timothy 6 verse 17    **\n“Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, Who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;”   **\n\nDeuteronomy 8 verse 12, 17,18   **\n12 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt therein; \n17 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth. \n18 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God  for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant which He sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.    **\n\nSometimes, people may relax by playing sports like Badminton in the house with the children or with friends. It is leisure which removes tension and relaxes the body. Do not show your limited knowledge by saying, “Eh! I went to his house and saw him playing Badminton. Oh Christians of these days!” Jesus taught His disciples rest and relaxation to regain strength.  **\n3.6 Avoid Risky Places and Activities.  **\n Avoid places and activities of danger and take precaution for your soul. Do not say that you have enough faith.    **\nJohn 7 verse 1 to 9  **\n1 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee for He would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill Him.\n2 Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.\n3 His brethren therefore said unto Him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that Thy disciples also may see the works that Thou doest.\n4For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If Thou do these things, shew Thyself to the world.\n5For neither did His brethren believe in Him. \n6 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come but your time is always ready.\n 7 The world cannot hate you; but Me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. \n8 Go ye up unto this feast I go not up yet unto this feast; for My time is not yet full come.\n9 When He had said these words unto them, He abode still in Galilee.  **\n\nThere are many places, activities and plans which you must be careful about. For instance, one needs to be careful of night journeys because it is always very risky, both because of robbers and of accidents. You may say the Lord will take care! Sure, He will. If you are persuaded to do so, go ahead. But if you are told that a particular road is risky in the night, please, stay back and continue your journey in the morning. Learn from Jesus. He would not just carry Himself to the Pharisees to be stoned and killed. Then He would not have finished the work that brought Him to the earth. So be security conscious.\n\nYou may say, “I do not bother about drinking or eating deadly thing because Jesus said, it shall not hurt me!” Yes, but not in your pride and carelessness. That mango, is it washed? My stomach will sanctify it, you said! But you are taking risk. The devil told Jesus, Cast down yourself from this high mountain, for it is written, He shall give His angels charge over thee. What is the answer that Jesus gave? Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. That promise is given for circumstances you cannot control which God knows. He will activate His promise and power, but not for carelessness in activities, hygiene and eating food without caution and prayer.    **\n\nLeaders should not just choose any person or woman to cook food for God's Ministers. Know that we have enemies in this gospel service. Do not pick any woman that volunteer or is forwarding herself! Some of these witches and wizards are very forwarding. They will say “I will be the one to take care of Ministers' food”. You may think that it is in righteousness, but it is not. You must pray very well. Is your wife really qualified to cook for Ministers? This woman who fight with you in the house all the time wants to cook for the Ministers? Under what anointing? Check well and do not be careless. Do not expose God's Ministers to danger and do not expose one another to danger. Do not tempt the Lord your God. Wake up to understanding and caution.  **\n\n 3.7 Wisdom Is Profitable To Direct.  **\n\nIf you are sick, pray to God to heal you. If you see that it persists, you can call the elders to pray for you. Where required, you may consult a doctor for your treatment. It is wisdom to submit to hospital tests to know your physical condition. Many people are diabetic, many have hypertension and many have some other sicknesses that if known early, can be cured. “Brother, can you go for medical test?” “Ah, do not bother,” you said. It is fear and you are doing harm to yourself. “I prefer not to know what is wrong with me.” Ignorance will kill you, if you prefer not to know what is wrong in your body. \"Brother, Brother, thieves are in your house!” \"Why are you giving me that information? Do you want to put fear in me? I do not like that, I want to go to my house\". That is you. You do not like knowing the truth. You prefer to hide under darkness! You hide under a lie! Ignorance of the sickness and disease wrecking your body is destructive.   **\n Isaiah 5 verse 13 ,14  **\n13 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge and their honourable men are famished, and their multitude dried up with thirst.\n14 Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure, and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.    **\n\nIf you have health challenges, why not go to the hospital? If you delay in child bearing with your wife, why not check up with the hospital? If you see yourself not sleeping well or sleeping too much, why not go to the hospital for checkup? You have been praying without result, why will you not do this? It is for your good. Let not the devil kill you through ignorance. God has not given you the spirit of fear. Why are you afraid? Truth is always truth. Hospital test will not give you something or result of what is not in your body. By the way, you have the chance to test in many places. Do not quickly conclude it is Satan oppressing you or witches and wizards. Many satanic sicknesses are cured in the hospitals.    **\n\nGo for checkup so that the sickness will not throw you down or cause you to die suddenly! Regular checkups will help you know when sickness comes in. This is the wisdom of God through the instrumentality of physicians. But if you refuse, God may keep quiet. Somebody that died through carelessness may not make it to heaven either. He did not have faith. If he had faith in the wisdom of God on medicines and made use of the same, he would not have died. Now that he died in that way, where is he going? Do not refuse godly counsel.  **\n\nProverbs 29 verse 1    **\n“He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.”    **\n\nMany churches reject the use of medicine and doctors to their eternal damnation. May the Lord make you to use this knowledge to keep you alive. May the Lord give you the grace to work for Him to the end. May the Lord save your family? May the Lord save your neighbors. May the Lord save the world. May the Lord make you an instrument in His hand. May the Lord keep you physically and spiritually healthy.    ** **\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR  **\nTHE USE OF MEDICINE IS SCRIPTURAL  **\n\n4.1 All Things Are Yours In Christ  **\n\nChristians are the children of God and He has given them all things to enjoy including medicines. Children of God can use faith for their healing or medicines for their cure when they are sick. They can take conventional or herbal medicine. Herbal medicine to be used should be hygienic and free from demonic connections.  **\n First Corinthians 3 verse 21 to 23  **\n21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; \n22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;\n23\tAnd ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.  **\n 1Timothy 6 17  **\n“ Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;”   **\n\n“…all things to enjoy”. Emphasis is on “all things.” All things that are beneficial to you in the creation of God are yours. God has given us richly all things to enjoy. That which will give you peace; that which will give you joy; that which will give you rest, is given to you by God. God has given to you all things to enjoy. Emphasis here is about the moral sense of all things not in evil, but that which ministers to you. Good health and sound living as promised in the Scripture from the Lord.  **\n\nJames 1 verse 17  **\n“ Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.”   **\n\n We notice in this life the things God has freely given to men to bless them on earth, such as knowledge of sound, light, knowledge of the sun, moon, planets and stars, knowledge of medicine, knowledge of invention, knowledge on repairs, knowledge of medical treatment, knowledge of building and constructions, knowledge of agriculture and food production, and many others so numerous to mention here. God freely give to man all things for his enjoyment and wellbeing. Those gifts of God should be utilized with appreciation to God instead of rejection.  **\n\n 4.2 Knowledge of Medicine Is Good.  **\n\nBefore the introduction of conventional or orthodox medicine, herbal or natural medicine had existed in the world. People had been taking medicine and getting cured to the point that the scripture says   **\n \nProverbs 17 verse 22   **\n “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine  \nThis tells us that medicines do good. The scriptures show that medicines do good to mankind.”  ** \n\nIsaiah 5 verse 20   **\n“Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!”   **\n\nIt is not out of place in the Scripture to say; my son, take medicine, for medicine is good, just as the Scripture also says, my son, eat thou honey, for honey is good. If the Bible calls honey a good thing and somebody comes and forbids the eating of honey; saying do not eat honey, the same Bible says, woe to that man. The person who says, do not eat honey, it is evil, is saying, that which God says is good is not really good, but evil. That was what Satan told Eve and Adam in the garden to destroy them. Such a person is satanic. Hence, churches that preach against the use of medicines by the sick are doing great evil.  **\n\n1Tim 4 verse 1, 3 to 5    **\n1 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; \n3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth. \n4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving;\n5 For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.   **\n\nThe devil interferes a lot among mankind to turn them off from that which is good by naming it evil, especially in the church, to the point that some creation of God, beautiful as it is, given for human benefit, Satan would come and say they are evil; or he passes through some preachers, some religious men, to lay a bad name on a good thing. Medicine has suffered much attacks. Many people have come up to say it is a sin to take medicine, or in fact, that those people that take medicine will go to hell because it shows they do not have faith in Jesus. That is a doctrine of the devil. The scripture says that medicine is good. The Bible says that God created all things good for our use with prayer and thanksgiving.  **\n\n\n First Timothy 4 verse 3 to 4  **\n3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.\n4 For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving   **\n\nHe created it to be received by believers. They that believe and know the truth receive it with thanksgiving. Your prayer over it sanctifies and purifies it. As you use it, bless God and be happy for His wisdom. Maybe there are people that up till now do not use handset, because when the handset (telephone) came-in newly, some people said it was the mark of the beast  “How will you stay here and call somebody in a far place and speak to him unconnected? It must have something to do with Satan.” Maybe due to ignorance, they say so and withdraw themselves from it. People are always (through the devil) misinterpreting the good works of God. Knowledge is good, that is why the Bible says, “It is not good that a man be without knowledge”. And the Bible says also that in the later time, knowledge shall increase. The Bible says that knowledge is good. Knowledge of discoveries is a good thing. Otherwise, there would have been no advancement in human society. Always go to the scripture, know the language of the scripture, the spirit of the scripture and enjoy the fullness of God in this life.  **\n\n 4.3 Medicine And Satanism.  **\n\n Medicine exists purely and completely separate from Satanism, although Satan often takes advantage of this to introduce his vices to humanity and lead them to bondage. Who created water? God! Is it for good? Yes, it is for our good. You can go to where there is water and use it as you want. You can go to the river or to the stream and use the water as others do. Some can just sit by the river and enjoy nature. Satan has made many people to fear a body of water because of mammy water (water spirits). They warn others not to sit near the sea or river because of water spirits. This is the work and deception of Satan. Satan has laid claim to the body of water by showing human beings that his kingdom is inside the water. Who gave him that power? God created water for man, not Satan. With this knowledge, you can go to any body of water and do that which is natural, which will minister to your good and to the good of mankind. You are not sinning, neither will you be hurt. So in the same way, some people think that all these medicines, conventional and herbal are from Satan. What makes them satanic? Did Satan create them? NO! They are the handiwork of God and God has made them good. It is Satan that is taking advantage of human ignorance to promote his name. We must not give God's glory to Satan or condemn God's good work.  **\n\n4.4 The Source of The Knowledge of Medicine.  ** \n\nGod leads man instinctively and by other means to discover that which is good for his life. That is, something you can know. You have been told that medicine has been in existence since the beginning of the world. God directs man how to discover the things He has put in his world to use them for the good of man and for His glory. God is the one that gives the knowledge of medicine and medical therapy.  **\n Isaiah 28 verse 26  **\n“For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.”   **\n\nYou may be wondering  how did man came up with the knowledge of the airplanes in the air, the ships on the sea and the vehicles on the roads? How did man came to invent these? Let us get the answer in the Scripture above, “For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him”. You might also ask  how did man discover medicine? How did traditional medicine evolve? How did they know that combining this leaf with that leaf will cure a particular sickness? Once again, get the answer from the Scripture above, “Verse 26. For his God doth instruct him to discretion and doth teach him”. You may also ask, how did the doctors come to operate upon a man and discover something and give that thing a name? How did they come to know the functions of the various parts of the human body? They can draw it and label it. How did they come to know this? Let us come back to the answer, “For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him”. How come that in a village, there is somebody there that is able to know how to cure this or that? How did it happen? Let us go back to the answer, “For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.” The God who made this life knows the needs of life, hence He reveals solutions to people's problems or ailments, instructs people, tells them and demonstrates how it can be handled. This can happen in a dream. In a dream, they may see somebody perform this. Sometimes it may be a voice that may speak to them. Sometimes, it is just instinct. The mind may be able to imagine some things and just see the realities of those things. As they say “I am going to work it out and see.” To their surprise, it works! Why do we think that God created this world and it is Satan that is managing it for God and that everything that is happening is Satan?  **\nPsalms 24 verse 1  **\n“The earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.”  **\n Ecclesiastes 11 verse 5   **\n “As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou knowest not the works of God Who maketh all.”  **\n\nYou always say to people on herbal medicine, “be careful, Satan! Satan!!” Why do you think like that? Let me ask you, the animals  sheep, goats, cows, dogs, chicken and others, and the bush ones too, do they get sick? Who cure them? How are they cured? They go to look for curing leaves. Even the animals know how to treat their sicknesses. Let us go back to same scripture. Instead of saying, his God, now say its God. “For its God doth instruct it to discretion, and doth teach it”. Can you see God? Now, do you see God in everything now? Do you see God in the knowledge of life, in the beneficial knowledge of life? \n\nDo you know that Satan hates everything that is good? He is never for the benefit of mankind. He does not do anything that is good, except he will use it as a bait. He will use a good thing which is from God and put his evil in it. But for good, good does not come from Satan. Therefore, do not always attribute every good thing that goes on in this life to Satan. Even among unbelievers, the God that made them wants them to be healthy. If they die, how would they hear the gospel? How would they hear the message? Does not the Bible say that it is not the will of God that any man should perish but that all should come to the knowledge of God and repentance? Would not God therefore do all that is required to keep them alive until they can have opportunity to come to repentance? So why do you think that the people among them who are treating them in their sicknesses and diseases are all demonic? Demonism and curative medicine are two different things. Do not listen to ignorant men and church leaders.  **\n\nMatthew 12 verse 22 to 28  **\n22 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb and He healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. 23 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the Son of David? 24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. \n25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand;\n 26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? \n27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. \n28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.  **\n\n4.5 Demonism and Medicine.    **\n\n A man is first demonic, then he gets good medicine. He may or may not apply his demonism on his treatment. Good medicine is a natural formula. He can only bring his demonism into it to defile mankind. If he says, “okay,  before I do this for you, you will sacrifice this; you must do this or that; when you are cooking this medicine, sprinkle the blood of animals on that stone. Do not take firewood from one side to another'. That is demonism. All those things are not part of what will bring cure. He is using the knowledge of medical cure to bring man into bondage – to Satan. Demonism and medicine are two separate things; be it herbal medicine or conventional medicine. Be it food supplements or chemical drugs, separate them from demonism. Do not follow those who call them products of Satan. Some will even tell you the Holy Ghost has revealed it. Reject it because it is not according to scripture. If medicine fails to produce results; conventional or herbal, it is no strange thing. In life, some things and people fail to produce expected results. Medicine is good as food is good. Medicine gives health and strength, food gives health and strength. So, demonism is different from medicine. What therefore you are to avoid and run away from is demonism. What defiles a Christian is demonism not medicine; whether herbal (traditional) or conventional. It is that aspect of the treatment that is in darkness, that has not the light of the scripture, which Satan takes over because he is the prince of darkness. The people who do the inventions for us of various things of life are not all believers. Why are we not  saying that the aeroplane is demonic? Why are we not saying that the motor vehicles are also demonic? Why are we not saying that the clothes manufactured for us are demonic? The people who made them are mostly unbelievers. Should we then say that unbelievers who do treatments are demonic or their treatments are demonic because they are unbelievers? Look well and understand with your heart.  **\n\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 7  **\n“Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.”  **\n\n 4.6 Suffering of The Righteous.  **\n\nHere, we are considering the cases of sicknesses and diseases of the righteous because there are people who think that the righteous cannot be sick. Not that the righteous must be sick. No! Of course, the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick. However, let us consider the following circumstances in order to understand more of God’s wisdom   **\n\n i. God's sufficient provision    **\n God can manifest His power in a special sense as He led the children of Israel from Egypt to the promise land. The Bible says that there was no feeble man among them. \nEven the clothes that they put on their body did not wear out. That is a special manifestation of the power of God. God can decide to make things happen this way. But is it that believers' clothes do not wear out? No! They wear out. The clothes you used have worn out many times. In fact, the clothes you used four years ago, you may not wear them again. Why? They have worn out following the law of nature. At times, God will allow the law of nature to take effect. Why? He has made sufficient provision to counteract it. So, believers can be sick. Do you know that the brook of water that Elijah was sent to by God followed the law of nature and that it dried up eventually to the point that he had to look for another place, because that was the law of nature? God allows nature to have its own course. He may not choose to alter it. He can alter it by miracle but He does not do it always.  **\n\nii. Need for Body guard.  **\n\n Ezra said, “I thought to go to the king to tell him to give us escort as we move to Jerusalem because of thieves, evil men and attackers on the way.” If he had requested for this, it would not have been a sin. No! It would not have been sin. People who do not understand scriptures reason things differently. Some of such persons may be questioning, “Why is it that you see men of God carrying security men?” Why are you asking that? Is it evil? Most people who see Jesus in visions say they see Him with two angels or with an angel not that anybody can hurt Him but the escorts are essential to render Him service. That a preacher goes with some people as escorts is not a thing to condemn. Ezra now said, “Because I have told the king about the greatness of God, within this short period, if I go back again, my message will be mixed up.” Ezra prayed, “God, we would have requested for security in our journey but I want You to consider that Your name and power have been exalted before. We have told the king you can do all things in your power. Oh Lord, give us Your security!” The Lord heard him because there was a special request for it. Otherwise, the normal law of life, in such a journey, is to go with security personnel. For ye shall not tempt the Lord your God. When Jesus noticed that they wanted to kill Him in the Jewry at that time, He never walked in the Jewry. So let us have a good understanding.  **\n\niii. Sickness of the Righteous.  **\n\n Can the righteous be sick? Yes! The righteous man can be sick and can be oppressed by the devil. He is in this world. Satan is in this world.  **\n\n Psalms 41 verse 1 to 3  **\n1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble. \n2 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth and Thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies. 3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing, Thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.  **\n\nWho is this man the Lord is talking about? Of course, the righteous man. Can he be sick? Yes! The righteous man can be sick. Therefore, know this scripture so that humility will always be with you. Know this scripture so that you do not go into hypocrisy and be giving false testimony to show how righteous you are, attaching it to your righteousness. “No, I have not been sick all this while. In fact, since I gave my life to Jesus.” Yes, God did that for you, but do not question your brother in Christ that is sick. Rather, pray and deliver him. It is God's grace you have enjoyed. Even among sinners, there are those who have never been sick. But in reality, both the righteous and sinners can be sick, but faith and prayer would heal the righteous. God will make all his bed in his sickness.  **\nJob 2 verse 7 to 8  **\n7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the ORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.\n 8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.  **\nSatan went out from the presence of God! The Lord was aware that Job would be sick. The Lord knew today that in the evening, Job would be attacked with sickness. What did God do about it? He was quiet. I want you to know this so that you will be a humble and meek child of God. When Isaac was bound, he did not resist it. He gave Abraham all the cooperation to bind him. He did not struggle against him. Some miseries may come into your life, do not deal roughly with God. Some sicknesses may come on you, do not ask rough questions. God did you not know? Were you not aware that it was coming to me? \n\nDid He not know? He knew. Was He not aware? He was aware that it would happen the way it happened, that the name of the sickness would be called this! He was aware but kept quiet because you do not know the contention between Him and Satan. You do not know what He is planning to do concerning the situation. Were you not created for His glory? What if He decides that you die? Job said, “though He slays me, I will still trust in Him.” So be calm. Do not find fault with God, even on the duration of the sickness. Did Job pray the first day he saw the sign? Was he praying all through the period of the sickness that God should heal him? Yes. Was God answering his prayers? No. That was why Job said, “If I could see God with my eyes, I would ask Him, what was Your reason? Can someone take God to court? No. Job reasoned, oh that man can take God to court. But who can be the advocate?” So you have prayed, wait for Him. He told you He is aware. You are praying, but wait for Him. He is achieving something in a set time. Wait for Him. The vision is yet for an appointed time. Though it tarries, what should you do? Wait for it. At the end, the Lord will appear for you. Who did this thing to Job? Satan did it and not God.  **\n\nJob 2 verse 7  **\n“So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.”  ** \n\niv. Satanic oppression of the Righteous  **\n\nCan Satan oppress a child of God? Yes. Then why would you say to the child of God oppressed in his dream that he belongs to a secret society and that it is initiation. Why do you say so? Do you mean no child of God must dream like that? Be warned! You are destroying the faith. You are   confusing a believer. Who told you that no child of God can dream like that? Is that not satanic oppression? Rather tell them to pray. Satan has come in their way. Let them check it up. What are the signs that a person is a child of God? Is it that he will not dream bad dreams? Is it part of the signs? No! For whosoever is born of God does not commit sin. Was he involved in the dream? Did he invite the spirit of the dream? Was he aware of the dream? Was his will involved in the dream? No. Then why would you say he has committed sin? He dreamed that he swam in the water and you said he has a Mammy spirit and needs to go for deliverance. He dreamed that he made love with a woman in the dream and you said, “oh! You have been initiated”. Where is this gospel from? Can you quote the scriptures? In the real sense, this man is a righteous man. This man is holy. It is just that he is passing through satanic oppression. The two are different. So that is what we need to know and understand so that we can have a balanced Christianity and not bring worries and anxieties to the children of God. Let them rather continue to pray until the matter is over. Let them seek counsel. Let them keep seeking prayers until the matter is over.  **\n First Peter 5 verse 7 to 11  **\n7 Casting all your care upon him; for He careth for you.\n8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour;\n 9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. \n10 But the God of all grace, Who hath called us unto His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you. \n11 To Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.  **\n\nv. Sickness can be an attack.  ** \n\nNow we have known that Job was sick. We know that there are many preachers that preach contrary things. Job was righteous and yet was afflicted with sickness. Not for his sins, but for a course that was in the hand of God. The Bible tells us in James Chapter five that the prayer of faith shall save the sick and if he has committed any sin, it shall be forgiven him. But remember the word “if”. It is not that the sickness must have come because of sin. No! “If,” because he can also be sick without being a sinner or without having backslidden. It is not necessarily a divine judgment. It is the attack of the devil or the law of nature.  **\n\nThere might be a particular sickness common in your father's lineage. Some of your siblings contracted it. It can pass to you. You may say, My blood is the blood of Jesus Christ, no sickness can pass to me”. Pray and use faith to resist it. Otherwise, it is a natural flow. It is a law. It is only that you have hope that if it comes, you have a Healer. The difference between you and the rest of the family members is that you know where you can be healed. As a believer, you can be healed or by faith resist it not to come to you by faith in Christ. Those among your siblings who are not in Christ or cannot pray through will suffer from the sickness because it is genetic. Since you have already known the thing, pray and God will hear you. Keep on praying until it clears.  **\nvi. Sickness of Elisha.  **\n\nNow, Elisha was sick. \n\nFirst Kings 13 verse 14   **\n “Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died… “   **\n\nYou know Elisha? Who was he? Aman of double-portion anointing. Yes, the presence of God was in him. The dead arose and the river Jordan got divided. Elisha! The Shunaamite woman's child came back to life. Elisha fell sick! Was he backslidden at this time? No. Let me show you the sign that he was not backslidden.  **\n\nSecond kings 13 verse 14 to 17  **\n14 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. \n15 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows. \n16 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands.\n17 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria; for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed them.  **\n\nProphecy continued and yet he was still sick. I say this because pride keeps some men of God from admitting that they are sick. Satan may say to them, if you allow your members know that you are sick, your ministry has finished. Who told you? A child of God can be sick. God can keep a believer healthy and sound in health according to His grace, but let us all know that His children can be sick also.  **\n\n4.7 Reasons For Sickness.  ** \nGod has reasons He allows sicknesses upon His children. Some of the reasons include the following   **\n\ni.\tTo Teach Knowledge and Understanding.  ** \nHe wants to teach knowledge and understanding to His people. Jacob finished blessing his children and brought his legs back to the bed and slept or died peacefully. Some men of faith would say, “I do not need to be sick. In my dying time, I will not be sick. I will just sit down or lie down and the Lord will take me.” But there are preachers you did not hear hat they were sick. They just sat down like that and died. But their souls did not go to heaven. It was not that they were righteous and God took them. What happened to such ones is from Satan, not God. So why are you glorying over that? Why are you teaching that as doctrine? That somebody fell sick, do not say, “No! No! A believer cannot be sick and die in sickness.” What do you mean? Rather, when encouraging a person that is very sick, have two minds that  -   **\n(i). He may recover. (ii). He should prepare or be prepared for heaven in case he does not recover. The Hebrew children whom Nebuchadnezzar threatened to throw into the fire said, “Our God is able to deliver us. If He does not, we are still ready to die for Him and we will never bow for your god”. Because, God may choose not to deliver, always be mindful of eternity. Elisha died in sickness. Let not Satan pump pride into you in your dying sickness so that instead of examining your life and humbling yourself before God and men, you may get pride and speak proudly as though you are not subject to the law of truth. Your boasting may be carnal and can end up in your death without humble preparation for eternity.\n\n Let us not abuse the doctrine of faith in God in our hardships, attacks and sicknesses and perish because of pride. Always be humble. If you visit the sick ones, you should not introduce pride to them in the name of faith. Rather, quote the promises of God to strengthen their faith. But study the circumstances; also remember that God who made the right hand also made the left. The right leg, the left leg. The right eye, the left eye. So there are these two chances in sickness. To live or to die. Remember in all circumstances to prepare the person for eternity.   **\n\nii.\tTo show God’s mercy (Healing is by mercy)    **\nWe have now known that the righteous can be sick.\nEpaphras was sick.    **\n\nPhilippians 2 verse 25 to 28    **\n 25 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.\n 26 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick. \n27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. \n28 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.  **\n\nLearn something here. Under the ministry of Apostle Paul, Epaphras was sick. The sickness lived long to the point that they feared he would die. Paul, what about giving Epaphras handkerchief? Paul, you did not have apron again? What about laying apron upon Epaphras? “Those manifested in a brief moment in my ministry. They were not things that continued with me.'' Alright then, Paul, were you not the one the Lord has been using for miracles round about? This one now is with you. What happened that he was not yet healed for long? Paul, is God not hearing your prayers anymore? He hears me, but this thing you are talking about is not a matter of boasting. It happens by the mercy of God. It is not a thing I can boast about. \n\nI will go and set him free. “It is God that had mercy on him and me. It took me long prayers, not only me; others too. We kept praying. God showed us mercy. So do not think almighty healing is in my hand.” Do not think an anointed preacher can handle every sickness. Not even in Jesus. When He went to His home, He laid hands only on a few people. Why? Unbelief was in them. Epaphras' case might not be the case of unbelief. It might just be that the Lord is teaching a lesson. “Paul, you and those who are working with you, learn to have rest. Are you not aware that at a time, I withdrew My disciples for a rest? See the effect on Epaphraditus now. And so the man was sick. All prayers of faith did not work but the prayer for the mercy of God. God had mercy on him. We know that Hezekiah presented his righteousness and God heard him. But it is not all the time that He will heal you because of your righteousness. It is for His mercy. God showed him mercy and Paul also, and healed him. That is what the word of God is teaching us. With this understanding, let us pray for the sick and the oppressed with all prayers but leave the result to God, Who knows and does all things according to His truth and mercy.  **\n\n4.8 God's Promises on Protection, Healing And Deliverance   **\nExodus 15 verse 26   **\n “And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His sight, and wilt give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians  for I Am the LORD that healeth thee.”    **\n\nGod afflicts sinners with diseases but not his faithful children. He afflicts sinners because He says, “I will put them on your enemies” as part of His judgement, because He is a God of Judgment. For the children of God, God is their healer. When sickness comes upon them, God goes to heal them. He is their Healer. You do not need the attention of a medical doctor when there is no ailment to treat.   **\n Deuteronomy 7 verse 14 to 15   **\n “Thou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. 15 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.”  **\n\n“There shall be none barren among thee.” Understand it scripturally. Zechariah and Elizabeth his wife lived without children for long. Why? She was barren. But, how long? God was watching it. Did it come to an end? Yes, it came to an end. So, the scripture may not be talking about a momentary situation. But it is possible that a Christian couple may remain barren until they die. Search through the scripture to understand why God allows it so. Understanding will keep you. Discretion will preserve you.\n\n Paul did not marry. Who made him not to marry? God definitely. God who gives wives to men did not give Paul one because it would affect the work he was called to do. Similarly, somebody else who is a child of God and a minister of the gospel may marry and the Lord may not give them children. Why? It may affect the work they are called to do. There are genuine ones among these people who may not marry, for the gospel's sake, not as the Catholics do, but by the will of the Lord. God gives sufficient grace to those He calls according to His will.  **\n\n4.9 God Wishes You to Be Healthy.  ** \nThird John 2   **\n“ Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. “   **\nThat is the desire of God. Your prosperity and health is God's desire for you. Follow the conditions required and you will find them according to the will of God. “I wish above all things.” It is God's desire for you. Believe this in your heart, pursue it and get it.  **\n\n Matthew 15 verse 22 to 28   **\n22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto Him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.\n 23 But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and besought Him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. \n24 But He answered and said, I Am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\n 25 Then came she and worshipped Him, saying,  Lord, help me.\n 26 But He answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.\n 27 And she said, Truth, Lord; yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.\n28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.   **\n\n Verse 26 says “But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs”. Which thing now is the children's bread? “Healing and deliverance.” It means God's children can get sick. His children can be oppressed. Therefore, whenever they are sick, as anybody can be hungry and need food; He also gives the sick healing and the oppressed deliverance. They are His children. His children can be sick and can be oppressed by the devil. How do you know that they are His children? They do not commit sin. But the person who is “possessed” by the devil commits sin because Satan has taken over the will of the person. He does things that are evil. So we say do not say that a child of God has been possessed by Satan. Those possessed by the devil do not have the power to do righteousness. But a real child of God can have sickness; can have Satan disturbing in one way or the other. Satan can kill his child or his wife as the case of Job. But remember that God was aware and watched over the case.\n\n In some cases, the affected believer did not rise up to fight at the appropriate time. But to some, God allows it so because there is a lesson in life that lies behind the curtain known only to God. Sometimes, Satan knows too as in the case of Job. So, now, we understand that the righteous can be sick, oppressed, barren or poor. But God is our Saviour, Provider, Healer and Deliverer.  **\n\n4.10 How the Lord Heals And Delivers.   **\n\n i. Through activating the word of His promise.   **\n \nGod can sustain you by the word of His promise that sickness will not come on you. Beloved, I wish above all that thou might prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth. God can keep you in good health and you will not know sickness. The inhabitants will not say I am sick. This is preventive healing. The sickness does not come, which many of us enjoy. We should always trust in God to keep us from sickness and pray always for our protection and preservation. “It shall come to pass that before they call I will hear”.\nThe answer comes before the matter began. They poisoned some food and you are not even aware. But God took care. So beautiful. In this sense, God is doing many things unaware to us which we need to thank Him.  **\n\n ii. Through personal faith and prayer on His words and promises.  **\n\nPsalm 107 verse 17 to 19  **\n17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted. \n18 Their soul abhoreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death. \n19 Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and He saveth them out of their distresses. \n20 He sent His word and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.\n\nGod heals and deliver His children through Prayer and faith on God's promises. The trouble came because, may be, you committed sin, or whichever way the sickness came. Go to God in prayer. Cry to him. Call upon him. Fight in his name, fight by his word. You will be healed. This is one way God does it.  **\n\niii.\tThrough prayer and intercession of others over the sick.   **\nJames 5 verse 14 to 16   **\n14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;\n 15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins. They shall be forgiven him. \n16 Confess your fault one to another and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual, fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.   **\n\nCan you see the place of intercession? As a believer that God uses for people to be healed, do not be proud to say; “I will not make anybody know that I am sick. If I tell them I am suffering from this or that sickness in my body, or passing through some satanic attacks, people will not believe in me again. They will stop coming to me to pray for them. Because of this wrong thought in your heart, we want to give you the complete knowledge of scripture so that you will be delivered from this unrighteous attitude. Put on the humility of God and defeat Satan in your life.  **\n\nMatthew 18 verse 19 ,20    **\n“Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.\nFor where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.”    **\n\n You have been praying against that sickness and it has not left you. You have prayed and prayed and prayed. The Bible says, two are better than one, for they have a good reward for their labour. Get another person. Make the thing known. In fact the thing has become so heavy on you, call on the elders. The prayers church elders will pray for you will bring healing. Now, among yourselves elders, learn to pray for one another. (Confess your sins) in case you have done something evil that blocks the healing. Confess it to the appropriate person or authority. Pray for one another and you will be healed.\n Are the elders not righteous? The prayer of the righteous availeth much. But which prayer? The effectual and fervent prayer. Not this casual prayer many engage in. Effectual prayer, protracted and intense praying. It works! As says the scripture.  **\n\n James 5 verse 16 to 18   **\n16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. \n17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. \n18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.   **\n\nTherefore, it could be you, seek prayer. Call your brother. Thank God there are people who have the gifts of healing among the brethren. The Lord has been using them. Do not be ashamed to invite them or go to them. Tell them to agree with you in prayer. There are people the Lord has been using in deliverance. Talk with them to provide opportunity for you to be prayed for so that the Lord will destroy the works of Satan in your life and family or in troubling matters. Do not allow your mind to belittle the grace of God in people's lives. You are not greater than them in Christ. So in that way you can be healed. God is the one that arranged that prayer for salvation and to be done this way. When the circumstance for this comes, the spirit of grace will signal you  Call somebody else! Call somebody else! But as long as you say “God, you know I am too big to call somebody. God you are there.” God loves that type of challenge from the proud  to teach you lesson that without humility, you are nothing before Him. So let others learn that a 'big Christian man' like you remains sick because of shame. There is no shame for the righteous. Be humble that God may take you everywhere and do everything for you, in Jesus name.   **\n \niv.\tThrough the use of medicine.   **\n Many people receive their bodily healing from God through prayers, faith, and the use of medicine.    **\n\nIsaiah 38 verse 1 to 8, 21     **\n 1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order for thou shalt die, and not live.\n 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, 3 And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.\n4Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,\n5Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. \n6 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.\n7 And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;\n 8 Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.\n 21For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.    **\n\nThis righteous man of God was sick and even God said he would die. He did not agree with that message. He said, “God my heart does not agree. I still have the conviction that I need to do something more on this earth for you. So, please God do not do that.” God heard his prayer. May be the Lord was saying “Hezekiah, there are two options now. Do you want to die or still live? He said, “No! I want to do something more for you here.” Now, I want you to learn something. Hezekiah was sick and through answer to prayer, God said, “I will heal you.” It did not happen instantaneously. That was why God had to give a sign. God's word to Hezekiah was, “You may see delay in the fulfillment of what I said I will do. Let me give you a sign. Then rest on that sign and do not bother about it again. It shall go.'' The Lord did draw the sun backward a little. I do not know how long it took finally for that sickness to go but it certainly left. When the lump of figs was placed upon the boil, the Lord healed him. Using medicine requires time and patience. But the healing came. The healing did not take place that day. It might have been gradual until it all got disappeared, to show that the word that comes out of the mouth of God does not return to Him void until it has fulfilled what God has spoken. But remember a plaster of figs was involved. That was medicine. Again, see another form of medicine     **\n\nFirst Timothy 5 verse 23    **\n“ Drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities.”    **\n\nThe wine in the above passage is a medicine. It has a property to silence stomach problem. But what about faith? Could not faith silence it? Could not the prayer of faith silence it? Timothy prayed, it did not work. He revealed it to Paul. “Sir there is a stomach problem disturbing me.” Paul prayed, it did not disappear. Now Paul used wisdom. “Be taking little wine because if you drink water, it has a biting effect on your stomach. Wine has a soothing effect, a healing effect on your stomach. God made it so for our good. This does not refer to alcoholic wine. No. Because strong drink is a deceiver, you cannot drink it a little. If somebody has headache and wants to buy paracetamols to take, do not say, “Brother, do not waste your money, we will blot out that headache now through prayer.'' Here we desire to make you know that taking drugs is not contrary to the will and word of God. Do not make others ashamed of taking drugs and medical treatment.    ** \n\nv.\tGod can also heal by His sovereignty.    ** \nThe man lying at the pool of Bethesda did not ask for healing. Did anybody pray for him? No! Jesus just came and said, “Would you be healed?” He was thinking it was the healing of the pool and he said, “I do not have someone to carry me there.” Jesus commanded Him, “Rise up and be healed.” That is how people get healed in a crusade, not for their righteousness. Not even because they have faith. Not even because they were prayed for. Sinners enjoy this mercy because of the sovereign power and will of God.  **\n\n4.11 Reasons for This Expositions.  ** \n\ni. To comply with Christ's instruction to teach all things.  **\n\n Matthew 28 verse 18 to 20  **\n18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.\n 19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;\n20Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you  and, lo, I Am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen  **\n Paul also said  \nColossians I verse 28 to 29  **\n28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus \n29 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to His working, which worketh in me mightily.   **\n\nYou need to know this because the Lord said we should teach the believers all things written in the scriptures for your knowledge and practice.    **\n\n ii. To keep believers from the effect and danger of ignorance.    ** \n\nHosea 4 verse 6    **\n“My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Many have died because of ignorance.”   **\n\nMany churches are in ignorance today; their members are dying. Where are they going to? Heaven or hell? Surely Hell! Because they died under false doctrines; they died under deceit. Were they in Christ and in His Holiness? These people that were blocked from taking drugs  are they all righteous? Are they children of God? The bible says,  **\n\nSecond Thessalonians 3 verse 2     **\n“ And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men;  for all men have not faith.”    **\n\nThe unreasonable and wicked people blocked them. They submitted to their ignorant leaders so that they too can have positions and recognitions in the church. They keep themselves in their sicknesses and die in it. They die and go to hell. These churches have also multiplied hypocrites because there are those who cannot obey the rule, but privately take drugs for their health. These pretend that they are loyal to the teaching, but are liars. Some of these pretenders are the church leaders who lay this heavy burden upon others. Where is the righteousness they claim to possess and teach? God will judge these leaders for the yokes they have laid on the people because, that which is for their good, that which God provided for their health, they deprive the people from having access to it.   **\n\niii. To take away pride and shame from brethren in relation to medicine and medical treatment.  **\n\nNow, you are ashamed to take drugs before your brethren. You are ashamed even to go to the pharmacist. You are ashamed to be in the hospital because you feel so great. If they ask you, brother, oh, you come to the hospital? “No! no, I am here just to see somebody.'' This is pride. Hospital is a house of mercy. That is a house where your God operates. He pours down His mercies on men. Are you proud to be there? Are you greater than Jesus who works on people there? They pray to Him every day and He goes there to answer their prayers and demonstrate His mercies. \nYou are ashamed yet you are suffering from your sickness, and are dying. You need help. There is a way your case would have been medically treated and that sickness or family burden could have been gone. But you say you do not want people to see you in hospitals or pharmacies. God loves the humble and hates the proud.  **\n\n iv. To rebuke the accusers of brethren who accuse them of using medicine (traditional or conventional).    **\n\nThose who accuse the brethren for taking drugs and medication need to be rebuked because they are affecting the ways of God. They are causing confusion on the path of righteousness. “All things are yours”. “His God doth teach him; his God doth instruct Him to discretion”. All things have been freely given to believers to enjoy them. So, why are you accusing the people of using medicine, conventional or herbal as if to say it is a sin? What makes it a sin?\n\n The same knowledge of science the Lord gave to cause sound to be heard, spread sound and amplify sound so that great crowd can hear His word, is the same He gave to the scientists to produce an airplane so that the journey of years can be done in one day. The same knowledge He gave to scientists to plan and build various types of houses, to invent the telephone that you can now use to communicate with people far away from you; that same God has also given science the knowledge of medicine. \n\nWhy not refuse to enter vehicles, because it is man he gave knowledge to produce or manufacture the vehicles? Why do you enter airplane? Why do you use microphone in your church? It is man He gave this sense to produce those things you enjoy. He gave man the knowledge and wisdom to discover and produce medicine, conventional or herbal to cure people's ailments and you say it is a sin? Stop saying that otherwise you are offending.   **\nvi.\tTo bring healing to those who have been sick for long and are resisting drugs.  **\n\nThere are people who have been sick for long especially, new converts. When they are told that they do not need drugs, but faith only to be healed, they celebrate the news and refuse the use of medicine. That is a fresh faith. That faith has not been tested. With time they will come to a point where they could not explain why some sicknesses do not clear away even after much prayer, but they will not still want to take drugs for shame that they had said they would live by faith and people had heard them. Let us know that the God who answers our prayer of faith also provided the drugs, (conventional or herbal) for our healing and sound health and wants us to use them.  ** **\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE   **\nHERBAL MEDICINE   **\n\n5.1 Argument for Herbal Medicine.   **\n\n Herbal medicine is the study and use of medical or natural plants, which are a basis of traditional medicine, to treat sicknesses or diseases. \nSome people say that herbal medicine is not good. What makes it not good? Do they not use plants, their leaves and roots for food? From the same herbs you heal yourself. Then why do they say it is not good? Many will say, “How did it happen? Where did they get the knowledge from?” \n\n“His God doth teach him and instruct him to discretion.” (Isaiah 28 verse 26)   **\n\nGo and ask those who have benefited from this gift of God, how they came at it and they will tell you the history. You can only tell people not to partake in idolatry or shade blood for anything in the use of herbal medicine to avoid demonism. They should not offer sacrifice nor pay for such, as in offering chicken or goat for that. \n\nWhat did the disciples say? Do not trouble the gentiles. All you need to tell them is that they should abstain from blood and sacrifice to idols and eating things strangled. That is all you need to tell them, and leave them to have their liberty.  **\n 5.2 Accept Drugs, Medical and Herbal Treatment.  **\n\nMy people perish for lack of knowledge. Now you are free to use medicine, having known the truth. Either conventional or herbal medicine is a gift from God for human health. Go for operations. There are women who do not want to go for operation to remove fibroid. They say, “Pastor pray for me; I believe God can do it.” Fear is the problem. God provided grace for that man or for the medical scientist (Doctor), to know how to remove fibroid from you. Go for it, and let them do it. Thank God for all things have been freely given to us by God. Other reasons for the exposition include the following     **\n\ni.\tTo doctrinally silence those who assert that taking medicine for cure is sinful.  **\nMedicine, be it conventional or herbal, food supplements or whatever, is not sinful to take. The use of medicine is good. Is there any proof that anybody who takes medicine commits sin, or once you take it, you cannot be righteous again? If this can be proved then we can say evil is in it and there is death in the pot! They are safe. Believers take medicine and are cured or healed, and they continue in the service of God.    **\n\nii. To make brethren enjoy all the provisions of God which He has made for them for their godly life and ministry.  **\n Second Peter 1 verse 2 to 3    **\n2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, \n3 According as His divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him that hath called us to glory and virtue     **\n\nYou have a call to serve God. If that sickness continues, how will you excel? Will you just allow the sickness to kill you by saying “if God does not want to heal me let me die?” Do you know the cost of those words?    **\n\n5.3 Brief facts to note and remember.     ** \n\ni). The God who has given knowledge for all things for human convenience, safety, joy and peace has given knowledge for medicine to be discovered and produced for human health.    **\n\n\nJames 1 verse 17    **\n“Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with Whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.”    ** \n\nii). Medicine does good to man according to;   **\nProverbs 17 verse 22    **\n“A merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit drieth the bones.”    **\niii). There are two types of medicines; (a) healing medicines (b) poisonous medicines.   **\n\nJeremiah 30 verse 13    **\n“There is none to plead thy course, that thou mayest be bound up; thou hast no healing medicines.”    **\n\n“Thou has no healing medicines”. There are medicines that are to poison people, to kill people. There are medicines that are for destructions. Those are of the devil. But there are medicines for healing. That is God's gift for your safety, for your peace and for your health. \n\niv). Some medicines are gotten from herbs or leaves of trees and other natural creation of God, as seen in the case of king Hezekiah. A lump of figs was brought to be laid upon a boil and after a time, the boil disappeared and Hezekiah lived for more years.   **\n\nEzekiel 47 verse 12    **\n“And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary, and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.”   **\n\n “…and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.”\n Can you see that? God who made trees for food by giving us the fruit of it, also gives the leaf for medicine. But how  do we know which tree can heal this or that? God will let the medical people know and teach them how to apply it to the sick. Those He has given this duty, He will instruct them discreetly so that they can be teaching others.  **\n\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 2   **\n“And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. “  **\n\nSome people receive it by inspiration, while others learn it from them. That is what the scripture says.  **\n\nJeremiah 8 verse 22    **\n“Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?”    **\n\nCan you see that? They are my people. I expected that by the use of balm and the use of a physician among them, the health of my people should recover. You can get balm from some trees and other sources. God gives this knowledge. He created human beings and made provisions for our healing in His wisdom.  **\nv). Physicians use medicines to cure sicknesses.  **\n\nWe can see in the above scripture  Is there no balm (medicine) there? Is there no physician there that has the knowledge of medicine? The physicians have the knowledge of the application of medicine.   **\n\nMatthew 9 verse 12    **\n“But when Jesus heard that, He said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.”     **\n\nExactly! The sick people go to medical doctors who use medicines to cure the sick. How did they learn it? The God of heaven has told them and some got them through learning. They learn from others and in that way become physicians that treat the sick.   **\n\nvi). Physicians have value in the society Doctors have value in the society, both medical and traditional doctors.  **\n\n Job 13 verse 4    **\n“But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value”.    **\n\nJob was talking to his friends. “When I saw you, I thought you were physicians of value that can heal my situation. But I came to discover that you are physicians of no value.” There are physicians that have value. People look unto them! They cure people. The society respects them. Physicians have value and that is why the Bible says “Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physicians there? why then is not the health of the daughter of My people recovered?” This is because physicians have value in the society.  **\nvii). Luke was a physician by profession and he was loved and cherished by the apostles for his profession. Hence he was called The beloved physician. Apostles called him the beloved physician. It is likely they enjoyed his medical services.  **\nColossians 4 verse 14  **\n “Luke the beloved physician and Demas, greet you.”   **\nSee where the beloved is. Is it on “Luke” or on the “physician?” It is on the “physician.” If that sentence had said “beloved Luke, the physician”, you might still be doubting; “this physician of a thing, is there anything good in it? May be he was doing it before conversion.”  **\nThere are brethren who are in one field or the other who are among us and can do service for the brethren; the physicians too. His service as a physician was cherished among the brethren, including Paul.  **\nviii). Jesus and all that healed the sick by faith and in the name of Jesus are physicians in the spiritual sense.  **\n Luke 4 verse 22, 23  **\n22 And all bare Him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of His mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph's son? \n23And He said unto them, Ye will surely say unto Me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself  whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.  **\nWas Jesus healing with drugs? No! But as a Healer, He was a physician! So God works both spiritually and physically. They are all His. There is no realm that He gave to Satan. He gave the physical realm to man and He comes there and is working with man in the physical to glorify His name. In the spiritual He is in authority and in control. He remains the Healer. ‘...In My name ye shall heal the sick; ye shall cast out devils…’\nThe medicines recommended for use by traditional or herbal doctors are not charms or satanic materials given in witchcraft to harm or protect from harm, to prosper and succeed, which can damn one's soul to hell fire. Rather, they are God's gift for healing.  ** **\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX   **\nJESUS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY AND FOREVER  **\n6.1 Jesus Christ Remains The Healer.   **\nAct 10 verse 36 to 38    **\n36 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ; (He is Lord of all )\n 37 That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;\n38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with Him.   **\nJesus is our great deliverer and healer. He goes about, even now, doing good, healing the sick and delivering those who are oppressed by the devil. Through the mention of His name, demons are cast out, the sick gets healed, and the power of demons are broken. He remains the healer forever as he was yesterday.   **\n6.2 His Promises Continue To Be True.  ** \nIsaiah 46 verse 3 to 5   **\n3 Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by Me from the belly, which are carried from the womb \n 4 And even to your old age I am He; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you  I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.\n 5 To whom will ye liken Me, and make Me equal, and compare Me, that we may be like?    **\nThat is what the Lord is saying today to us, His children. He is talking to a people that have believed on Him. He is saying this to people that are obedient to Him. It is the voice of the Lord to you. Right from the womb, He has been preserving you. You did not die in the womb, He caused you to be given birth to. By His grace, you have lived up to this age and up to this time. Now the Lord is making this promise, saying, even to your old age He will remain faithful. The God that has kept you is promising He will continue to do so even to your old age and even to your hoar hair. Until everything about your hair becomes white! The Lord said even to that white hair, He is going to  carry you; and He said, I have made and I will bear. I have created you, I will bear your responsibility. He is going to carry you and he is going to deliver you. The deliverance, the healing you have experienced from the hands of God all these years shall continue in your life until old age, because that is the promise of God for you. \nThe deliverance from accidents, attacks from Satan and demons, from the witches and wizards that you have enjoyed all these years, all this time until this age, you will continue to enjoy it so. He will continue to carry you even to your old age. He will remain faithful in your life. The Lord will remain faithful to you in life! Be assured, be peaceful. Whom will you compare Me with? Are you going to compare me with a doctor? I Am higher than a doctor! Whom are you going to compare Me with? Are you going to compare Me with any great man? I Am greater than the greatest man! Are you going to compare Me with money? I am greater than money! Whom are you going to compare Me with?\n I say I am going to take care of your life. I say I am going to heal your life. I say I am going to break the yokes in your life. I say I am going to deliver you. I say I am going to protect your life. That is the voice of God! That is God speaking and I believe Him. That is the voice of the Creator. Let us see Jesus as a Manufacturer. He knows everything about you. The manufacturer knows everything about that which he has manufactured, the function of every part in the product manufactured. When it breaks down, he knows where the problem is and how to amend it. Jesus knows you because He is your creator. He knows what the problem is in your life. The doctors may not discover it. Medical Instruments may not be able to tell what it is. But the creator knows. He knows when you are complaining. He heard the cry of Ishmael when Ishmael was laid down in the bush. The Lord of sabbath, the great God heard the cry of Ishmael. He knew that Ishmael was looking for water. He knew that Ishmael was dying for lack of water. The Lord was determined to make that child live. The Lord is determined to make you live. God is determined to make you to survive. The Lord provided the solution. He told the mother Hagar, turn the other side and see and she turned and saw a well of water.    **\nGenesis 21 verse 15 to 19    **\n15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. \n16 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot, for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.\n 17 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. \n18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.\n 19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.    **\n There shall be solution for you. The Lord shall open up a well of water for your life. That is what the Lord is saying. He knows what you are passing through, your pain and discomfort. He knows everything. Is it not Jesus that said to Nathaniel, Before that Philip met you, when you were standing under the tree there I knew you. Nathaniel was surprised. Master, then you are the Son of God. Is that so? Then you are going to see more things. You are going to see more glory. That your eyes are open to know God, that your eyes are open to know Jesus, you are going to see more glory in your life. You are going to receive more visitation of God in your life. You are going to see more manifestations of God's love and power, because your eyes are open to know Him. He said, He that loves Me and keeps My word, I will love him, My father will love him and We will come and make our abode with him. You are going to know God more. Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him and I will save his life! Because he has known My name.  **\n6.3 Jesus Our Doctor.  **\n Exodus 15 verse 25, 26  **\n 25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,\n 26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in His sight, and wilt give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the LORD that healeth thee.   **\nAgain take Jesus as a Doctor. But more than a doctor. The doctor examines you to diagnose your sickness. He may need the help of some machines and their operators, to know exactly what the problem is. He then prescribes the drugs for you to take in order to be well. But Jesus does more than that on you. He knows your sickness. He knows how to get you recovered. He has the power to get you recovered. No sickness or problem is above His healing power. The Lord has healed many people with your kind of problem. He wants you to know that your case is in the realm of solution possibility. He wants you to know, that your sickness will still go. He wants you to know that your problem will still be solved. All you need to do is to believe.  **\n6.4 Jesus Is Your Deliverer.    **\n\n Luke 4 verse 18 ,19    **\n18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, \n19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.   **\n The spirit of the Lord is upon Me. He has anointed Me. Jesus is the anointed of God. The spirit came upon Him as a human being, as a Servant of God sent to deliver mankind, to break Satan's yokes on mankind. Young man, good news for you. The power of the devil wrecking your life shall be broken by Jesus. Although you are moving about like an insane person, you are not under control, you are moving from place to place as if driven by the wind. The Lord is saying he has concern over your life. He is going to stop the wild wind of the devil. He is going to ask those demons to leave your life.    **\nThe spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent Me to heal the broken hearted, to bring deliverance to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind. \nThe people that are under captivity, except by the power of God, they cannot be free. And that is why God's power will work on you. You see some people walk up and down, they walk up and down not willingly. Some powers are working on them. Some people find it a difficult thing to give their lives to Christ. Some powers are working on them. The Lord said to Moses, Tell Pharaoh, let My people get out of Egypt. I am taking them to a better land. Moses came back and said, Pharaoh said he does not know you. Yes, I know, Pharaoh does not know Me. Pharaoh is stubborn. I Am going to stretch forth My hand upon Egypt, then Pharaoh shall let you go. I Am going to stretch forth My hands, upon the forces that are scattering your life. That is God speaking. I Am going to stretch forth My hands, upon those things that have darkened your heart, those things that have confused your life. I Am going to stretch forth My hands of power. You shall be free. You will serve the Lord. You are going to get out of this satanic darkness.    **\nThe power of God shall make you born again. All those chains of the devil that have bound your life, fire shall burn them; the demons working against your life will be destroyed. Those chains shall be burnt out of your life in the name of Jesus! That is what the Lord is going to do. The Lord is going to set you free. You shall hear the noise of bones as the word of the Lord is going on. There was noise in the valley, and the dry bones shook. Your bones shall shake by the Lord. The judgment of God shall come upon your enemies. The Lord shall break every yoke in your life. In the name of Jesus! May the Lord set you free. Keep serving the Lord. Salvation is by God's power. Who is Pharaoh that said the people shall not go? Who is that devil, who is that witch or wizard? What have you swallowed in to your body that is resisting your freedom to serve the Lord? What have they marked on your body? What have they put in your blood that will prevent you from serving the Lord? If you are willing to obey the Lord, no power can hold you down.  **\nIsaiah 1 verse 19   **\n\" If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land”   **\n 6.5 Jesus Is Your Problem Solver.   **\nThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor. He has sent me to heal the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the blind, and to set at liberty them that are bruised.    **\n It is unfortunate that you have been wounded already. They have done many things against you. Charms are working against you. You have been bruised. You have been made confused in your mind. Your education has been halted. They have put a stop on you through some satanic powers. Your business life is affected. Your mind is confused. But believe and call on Jesus. New things shall happen to you. The salvation of the Lord shall come upon you. The deliverance of God shall fall upon you. You shall be delivered. Jesus will do it because you have known Him. You have known His name.  **\nPsalms 91 verse 14    **\n“Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him, I will set him on high, because he hath known My name.”    **\nThe Lord has given you this book to wipe away your tears. He has given you this book to comfort your heart. As you believe His word and call on Him, He will deliver you from the yokes of the devil. Why? He has need of you. He told His disciples, Go into the city, you will find an ass tied. Loose it together with its colt. When the owner asks you, what's happening? Say the Lord has need of it.    **\nThe Lord has need of you. Therefore, your chains will be broken. All those things that tied down your life, the power of God will break them down. The Lord has need of your life, He wants to use you. The Lord wants to glorify Himself in your life. The Lord wants you to glorify Him before men. That ass the Lord is going to sit upon it. They are going to dress that ass. They will put goodly clothes upon it. It will be decorated with some flowers, to make it beautiful, because it is going to carry the Great King. You are going to announce the coming of the Great King. Your life shall announce Jesus. That is why you are coming out from that miry clay and horrible pit. You are coming out from that coven. You are coming out from witchcraft.    **\nYour mouth shall preach Jesus. You are coming out from the captivity of sin. You are coming out from the captivity of masturbation. All those immoral powers, immoral thoughts, immoral lust in your heart, the Lord shall break them. He shall set you free. Glory to our God. That is what Jesus wants as your deliverer and problem solver.   **\n6.6 Two Kinds of Deliverance From Jesus Christ.  **\nThe first aspect is to be delivered from satanic oppression. The second is to be delivered from satanic inhabitation or possession. These, the Lord shall do for you by His mighty power. He shall deliver you completely from satanic oppression and inhabitation.  **\nJohn 10 verse 10    **\n“The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy, I Am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” ** \nFirst John 3 verse 8    **\n“He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose, the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil.”    **\n The works of the devil in your life, works of the devil in your body, the devil in your marriage and family, they will be destroyed in the name of Jesus! Jesus was manifested that He might destroy the works of the devil in your life, in so far as you are willing to be delivered. All you need to do in order to be free from the bondage of Satan is to confess and be ready to forsake your sins.  **\nHebrews 2 verse 14, 15  **\n 14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same; that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; \n15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.   **\nYou are his children. He does not want you to be under the bondage of Satan. Satan has threatened you with death. Satan has used men to threaten you with death. Dreams always point at you, that you will die. The Bible says the reason He became a man is so that He might destroy the devil that has kept you under the fear of death, under the captivity of death. God will send out destruction upon the devil himself, demons, man, woman, children, animals, anyone that says you will die, or is releasing destruction upon you; God's judgment shall come on them. He will release destruction upon those enemies of your soul. He  will cancel death over your life. The power of God will move round to break your yokes. Only believe that God's power is moving round you and is breaking the yokes. The Lord is loosening bonds. He is setting you free. He has broken the yokes. Glory to our God. The devil is doing many things to bring sorrows to you, to keep you in pains and confusion. Bad dreams have been disturbing you. That woman always comes to you to lie with her, that man who comes to you in the dream saying, he is your husband; that reproach is going back to the devil. Is there any force of witchcraft anywhere by any man or woman against your life? You are a child of Jesus the great king. Where are they? Jesus is King of kings and Lord of lords, the Jehovah God. Your time for freedom has come. Your God is angry with your enemies. All the poisons moving round your body will stop. By the power of God, that evil must stop! You who have loss of memory and cannot think well anymore, because something has affected your brain. The Lord has brought you to His workshop. You are in His workshop and He will deliver you.  **\n6.7 Your Creator Will Deliver You.    **\nYou are always facing failures. It is as if you will not make it in life. You turned to the left; it is not working. You turned to the right it is not working. You look confused and abandoned, no help. If my father and my mother forsake me the Lord will pick me up. If you do not have anybody on earth, you have someone in heaven, God. The One that created you, the One that formed you. Can a mother forget the child of her womb? Some may forget but your God is with you. Your struggle over masturbation will receive victory from the Lord. You do not know how to get freedom? Believe God. Call upon Him in faith and you will see yourself free. God will help you. The God of Heaven knows your sincerity and how you are struggling not to go to hell. And some powers of darkness have been hindering it. The Lord is coming to help you. You are always full of fear. Fear to sleep alone, to move alone, and to travel. It is from the devil. That spirit of fear must leave you today in Jesus name. You may have the case of demonic obsession. Your mind is taken over. It is like you cannot turn this way or that way. Satan has just grabbed your mind. You do not know what to do. The Lord will break the power of Satan in your mind and give you freedom. Turn your life to Jesus and receive liberty.    **\nSome people have the problem of demonic inhabitation. Your father, your mother, your parents, your loved ones took you to an herbalist. To them, they are protecting you.   **\nThey began to fix demons into your body by giving you various charms! Now, demons have entered and are living in your body, so your ways are corrupt. You yourself cannot live well in the world. You cannot live in peace. You are seeing double. Life is not convenient for you because you are carrying about evil spirits. You are carrying about evil spirits because of those charms in your life, because of those charms you have swallowed into your stomach. You are now seeing the damage they cause to your life. You see the beings that appeared to you in the night. You see where you find yourself. Very unfortunately, some of you turn to snakes without knowing. Before you know you find yourself in a serious embarrassment, you turn to an animal. The people have known that you are a snake. What a shame! A life of misery. A life of confusion. A human being that has been confused and driven away from the society of life as Nebuchadnezzar, driven away to the bush. They have spoiled you by putting unwanted things in your life. Your eyes are not seeing well. Your ears are hearing sound from the water. What a shame to be possessed or inhabited by demons, and to be kept in the realm of Satan. \nThe Lord shall close your evil eyes. The Lord shall break those things and set you free. The Lord shall break your yokes. The Lord shall deliver you completely. He shall give you a new life. God's power shall break the yoke. Those things shall come out of your life. You might have become a slave of Satan. Wherever satanic activities are going on, Satan sends you to go for attack. Can you withstand God? You have become an agent or errand boy to Satan and darkness. Bad employment!   **\n6.8 The Miseries of Following Satan.   ** \nThe demons that are associated with Satan, the Lord pushed them down from heaven and they are having tails now. You see them looking awkward. All glory has vanished out of their lives. The Lord has cast them out of heaven. They have come into your life to make you a cursed creature as they are. While other people sleep well in the night, you have a sleepless night, flying about. Bad life, wretched life, confused life!\n An unfortunate story of a woman in witchcraft was told, that she fell in a daytime in Lagos. Poor woman, Satan embarrassed her. There are poor boys and girls also who are in occultism and the devil has taken the glory of God away from their lives. The devil has put evil eyes in their body. The devil has put various things to abuse God in their lives. Poor and wretched people. Poor girls, the devil has taken them to the water and they are calling them mermaids or queens of the coast. They look like fish; poor girls! Satan has spoiled your life and make you wretched and confused. If you do not repent, hellfire is waiting for you. The pain and unhappiness in following Satan is harrowing. Run away from Satan. Cry to God and He will deliver you. The Lord will show you mercy and He will change your life! The Lord will free you from the bondage of the devil. May God reverse that wicked covenant and bring you back to life and God's beauty and glory. This book is the workshop of God. You are in the Lord's workshop. The Lord is repairing people who submit to His word. I pray you make yourself available, so that you can be repaired. Otherwise, if you continue this way, your marriage shall be a misery. Your marriage shall be a confusion. Your children will suffer if you do not repent. They are deceiving you in the satanic kingdom that you will be promoted. They told you, if you do more evil they will promote you. Can evil promote a man? Can failure be the reason of your promotion in the school? How can evil in the sight of God be the reason for your promotion? It is a lie of the devil. Lie!   **\n6.9 Reject satanic inhabitation and witchcraft.  **\n Demonic inhabitation, demonic possession is a bad thing! It is a bad thing that they initiated you into. Better cry out if you discover that a friend has initiated you. Cry out that the Lord may save you. But if you close your mouth you will die and go to hell. The same people will even kill you. You have been initiated and instead of crying out, “Save me, save me,” you are saying that if you talk they will kill you. \nWho are they? Are they your creator? Do they have power to kill you? Confess! Cry out! Kidnappers are carrying you in their vehicle and you met Policemen who stopped them to check the vehicle and the Kidnappers said “If you talk we will kill you, we will shoot you.” Please cry out for your deliverance. In the presence of police, they cannot shoot you. Cry out! You will be saved. Cry out and say I am a witch, I am a wizard, I am in the marine kingdom. Jesus help, help, help! Then the Lord will deliver you. Otherwise, there is no good future for you. Your future is bad. Your future is regrettable. Satan has done the worst over your life.  **\n6.10 Jesus' Power Is Higher Than Satan's.  ** \nSome people go mad; they give themselves to drugs – they are addicted to drugs and are moving about like hopeless people. People are reasonable, but they are not. People dress reasonably but they do not. You will find them near streams, abandoned houses, together with demons. Very unfortunate for them. They are not where reasonable people are. They have been driven to the corner of the world. They can only come out in the night! How can your life be reduced to such level? As a reasonable person, would you allow Satan to wreck your life? Instead of crying out, to get out of his hand, you are rather afraid that they will kill you. Jesus' power to deliver you is greater than Satan's power to kill or destroy. Why has Satan not killed you all this while? It is because God is resisting him. God is the one Who prevents Satan from harming you. \nThere is a power higher than Satan's power. I am introducing you to the region of safety. Come to where it is not 'raining'. The House of God shall protect you from the rain. That is why I am inviting you. I am calling you to come to be delivered. Do not go to those places in the night anymore. Refuse it. Tell God about those people who are troubling you. The Lord will handle them. People may be sent to supervise you, to ensure you do not repent, but the angels of God are supervising you and are stronger than demons and their human agents. Fear not. God will take care of those gangs. For you who are sent as agents to spy the people of God and to do harm to them, or to prevent them by witchcraft not to serve God, the Lord knows you and is marking your days. If you do not stop those evil works and turn to God, terrible judgment is waiting for you and you will be swallowed up by hellfire. Pulse and ask Jesus for a new life. Promise Him you will obey and serve Him for the rest of your life. This will make you enjoy many benefits from Jesus and eternal life.  ** **\n\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN    **\nJESUS IS OUR HEALER  **\n7.1 Taking away sins and sicknesses.   ** \nMatthew 8 verse 16, 17  **\n 16 When the even was come, they brought unto Him many that were possessed with devils; and He cast out the spirits with His word, and healed all that were sick;\n 17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.  **\nI am so happy that all sicknesses in your body were laid upon Jesus on the cross. I am grateful Jesus has come to carry away all sicknesses in your body. I am saying Jesus is ready to remove your sickness. As He removes sins from people, He also removes sicknesses from people.  **\nPsalms 103 verse 1 to 5   **\n 1 Bless the Lord, O my soul and all that is within me, bless His holy Name; \n2 Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits, \n3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who health all thy diseases; \n4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; \n5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.   **\n\nThe Lord says He is renewing your youth. As he is taking away sins, from people's lives, He is also taking away sicknesses. Trust the Lord and you will find out that you have been healed. Pay good attention to the Lord Jesus as you read on. You will see your sicknesses going, going, gone! As He is cleansing you from sins, sicknesses are also leaving your life. That is what God wants to do for you. There is something I want to let you know  Healing means removing sickness from the body. There is a natural way God can do this for you. This involves taking medicines, traditional or conventional. God uses men and means to bring natural healing to people. When these men and means are clean without demonic influence, you avail yourself to enjoy their service for your healing.  **\n7.2 Taking Medicine.   ** \nIt is a good thing to take medicine. Some members of some denominational churches may have the belief that it is a sin to take medicine. There may not be righteous people in such churches. It is the devil's way of sending people to hell. By this prohibition, when the unrighteous get sick he will not take medical treatment and so die in his sins and go to hell. If you say in our church we do not take medicines, you will die and go to hell. You are not yet prepared for heaven. The devil wants to cut short your life. He was the one that told your elders or founding fathers to teach against the use of medicine. But what says the scriptures?\n Proverbs 17 verse 22; A merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit drieth the bones.  **\nA merry heart doeth good like medicine. Medicine does good to a man, relieves a man. A person laughing with the whole of his heart is relaxed. It relieves him of tensions. It does good like medicine. And that tells you medicine is a good thing. It will do good in your life. There is nothing wrong in taking Panadol or paracetamols. There is nothing wrong to take drugs for your stomach problem. There is nothing wrong to go to hospital and be operated upon. There is nothing wrong, for all things are yours. The wisdom of God has given us the medical and traditional doctors to enjoy, even as you enjoy the blessings of God from other sciences  mechanical science, Chemical science, biological science and all. Medical science is also to be enjoyed because God provided it. All good things are yours.  **\nFirst Corinthians 3 verse 22  **\n“Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;”  **\nDo not listen to those people who are teaching otherwise saying 'I am a child of God, I will not take medicine, I have faith.'' Is that so? Is it not Paul who told Timothy not to take water but a little wine for his stomach trouble? Is it that Timothy did not have faith? Paul who had been praying for the sick to the point that even handkerchiefs from his hands would heal the sick, had prayed for Timothy. Yet, he directed him to take a little non-alcoholic wine, a natural produce God has made with healing property. Did he say no to Paul's inspired counsel? Who knows whether God purposely refused to heal Timothy by prayer only in order to teach believers this principle?  **\nWhen we were growing up in our Christian life, we said we would not take medicine. It became a pride. We would testify, “In fact, for the past two years I have not taken drugs.” That was pride, some sinners have not even taken drugs for the past ten years. What about it? It is not faith to them but luck. It is not everybody's body that is prone to sickness! Some people are living healthily without taking drugs, yet sinners! So, it is not necessarily because of your faith. Not that faith cannot work. Faith works perfectly but get wisdom, go with wisdom, otherwise, you will perish in your sickness.  **\nThere are some sicknesses which, if contracted, can be medically handled. Although you have prayed seriously over it but you are still in pain, the Lord has said the hospital is there for you. I made that provision also. But you are saying, Lord you must heal me, not hospital. Are you going to force God? Are you going to instruct God? The more you delay in taking medications, the more it is dangerous to you. A stitch in time saves nine! If you get that matter settled now, the damage it will cause you in the future will be avoided. But if you do not get it settled now it may become worse. It may grow worse and shall affect you in many other ways. It will affect your marriage and other activities. It may affect your longevity. It will affect you in many areas. Why? Because of your foolishness! Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child (a novice). That is why you need to know this. Where you need to use medicine, be free to do so. It is the will of God for you. But if you have received a strong conviction of healing from God without the use of drugs, good. Faith produces evidences and manifestation in given time. Do not allow your situation to worsen when medication can give you solution.  **\n7.3 The sick needs a physician.  ** \nMatthew 9 verse 12   **\n“But when Jesus heard that, He said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.”   **\nDo you understand that? They that are whole and healthy do not need a doctor. But they that are sick, the Lord says, they need a doctor. The Lord says they need medical care. The Lord is saying you need a doctor. Convince yourself that you need a doctor. But if you are not sick you do not need one. Man of God, in spiritual superficiality, you are saying “I am the pastor of this people. If they see me take medicine, their faith will be affected.'' Are you the one that will build faith in them? Are you the owner of faith? Why are you speaking that way? It is the word of truth. Do the truth and teach people the truth. \nAgain, the Lord said, he that is sick needs a physician, a doctor. Are these doctors the ones that went to medical schools? Are physicians only those that attend formal education or schools? No! There are also traditional physicians. They did not go to school but have learned it through inheritance from their fathers. They have learned ways in which people can be cured of sicknesses! They specialize on alternative medicines. You find people that can dress bones even if the leg is completely broken. Have you seen them anywhere? They can dress the bones very well. Many of them are better than the conventional doctors in the hospitals. Those are also physicians! So whether it is the conventional medicine or the traditional medicine; once it has no connection with Satan or demons, and the man has not given himself to demons, is not telling you to obey demonic laws, but natural laws, it is clean medicine. It is the gift of God for you. The Lord gave it.    **\nJames 1 verse 17    **\n“ Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.”  ** \n7.4 Traditional Medicine Was the First.  **\n Before people started attending formal education or schools, how were they healing themselves? In a civilized society, they take animals to hospitals. But what about the uncivilized? What do the animals do? Are the wild  animals sick too? How do they cure themselves? They know what to do. They know the leaves to eat. They go about picking those leaves. Have you seen an animal picking some leaves to cure itself? So before conventional medicine came; before people went to school to learn it, there were people that knew the combination of leaves and roots to cure various illnesses. Where that is done naturally well and clean, it is for you. The scripture confirms this.   **\n Jeremiah 30 verse 12, 17    ** \n12 For thus saith the Lord, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous. \n17 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, this is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.   **\n I will restore health unto you. One of the ways this is done can be seen in the following scripture.    **\nEzekiel 47 verse 12    **\n“ And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary, and the fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.”\n The leaves of those trees can be used for cure. Herbal cure is of the Lord. You are free to use it.  ** **\nCHAPTER EIGHT   **\nHEALING THROUGH FAITH AND PRAYER   **\n\n8.0 Faith must go with prayer.  ** \nHebrews 11 verse 1,2  **\n 1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. \n2 For by it the elders obtained a good report.  **\nJames 2 verse 20, 26  **\n 20 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?\n26 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.   **\nThere are diverse areas of healings God gives to His children as can be seen in the discussions below    **\n8.1 Healing of sicknesses and Diseases.   **\nGod also heals supernaturally through faith and prayer. This is what Jesus did when he came. However, believers must pray fervently without ceasing for God's intervention in their cases. Healing through faith and prayer is what Jesus does to his children up till this day.  **\nMatthew 11 verse 2 to 5   **\n2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples, \n3 And said unto him, Art thou He that should come, or do we look for another? 4 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see;\n 5 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.    **\n Divine healing takes place up to this time because Jesus is still the Messiah. This is the sign of the Messiah to all mankind, to all generations. The blind receive their sights, the lepers are cleansed. Various kinds of sicknesses are healed. Everyone can get healed by the power of the Lord Jesus. This includes you!  **\nMatthew 9 verse 27 to 30   **\n27 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed Him, crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us. \n28 And when He was come into the house, the blind men came to Him, and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I Am able to do this? They said unto Him, Yea, Lord. \n29 Then touched He their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you. 30 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.    **\n“According to your faith...” All that the Lord wants to do is to stir up your faith! As you read on, get ready for Jesus to heal you. Pray for it. As these blind men came to Jesus and requested for mercy and demanded healing, that their eyes might be opened. He asked them if they believed he could do it. They answered Him, we believed. Very simple! He said, “Okay have it.” Their eyes opened immediately. Your sickness will go immediately. As you confess very simple faith on Jesus and say, “Yes Lord, I believe.” It will be done and those things shall vanish out of your life in Jesus name!  **\n 8.2 Healing from burdens and harmful memories.  **\nThe second kind of healing Jesus gives to those that believe and seek Him is healing from burdens and harmful memories.  **\nMatthew11 verse 28 to 30   **\n28 Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\n 29 Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I Am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\n 30 For My yoke is easy, and My burden is light.    **\n There may be burdens in your life. You are laboring over that burden. It is in your consciousness. You wake up to it every day. It is a burden. It has entered into your subconsciousness. You are carrying a problem about; something is wrong and how to overcome the problem becomes difficult for you. You are asking yourself, “How do I come out of this problem in my life? Your life remains unfulfilled. That trouble has entered your subconscious mind. It is a problem looking for healing. This involves past memories. \nSomebody did something against you, against someone you loved. It hurts you badly. Anytime you remember that thing you are not yourself. Maybe it has turned to unforgiving spirit now working in your life. You do not even know what to do again. Anytime you see that person, your body shakes. Many things have piled up on it. It is still having effect on your life. \nIt might be something you did wrongly. Maybe you killed someone. You did something very bad. Anytime you remember it, you are not yourself. You have tried to laugh it over but it is not working. You have said to yourself  let me do another one so that I will become used to it; but it is not working. You are confused. You are in pain because of the memory of the past. You now have fear! There is a fear in you concerning the future. What is causing this fear actually has overcome you. You sit in the church and you are not secured. You are interacting among members, yet you feel unsecured, all because of something that happened to you or you did wrongly. \nMay be, as a lady, you were raped when you were young. Your uncle slept with you or it could be your father. It damaged you deeply. Now that you are even married, anytime your husband touches you, your body shakes and you say, “Who is touching me?” Jesus will heal you. As the doctors carry out operations, that is how the Son of God will operate upon you and take away that problem or burden from you.  **\n8.3 Healing Of The Subconsciousness  **\nIsaiah 43 verse 18, 19   **\n18 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.\n 19 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.  **\n A subconscious mind notices and remembers information when one is not actively trying to remember the information, and influences one's behavior without realizing it. When a problem affects a person's subconscious mind, his behavior may also be adversely affected.   **\nThe Lord shall bring you to a point where you will not remember those things anymore. The Lord shall heal your guilt. He shall thoroughly set you free. When the Son of God sets you free you will be free indeed. That is what the Lord wants to do to free you from past memories. The numerous sins done, abortion committed, evil done by you, or done by others against you, He is going to release your conscience and subconsciousness from the grip of these things, so that you can receive inner freedom, peace and guiltlessness by the power of His word.  **\n8.4 Receiving Deliverance And Healing.  ** \nMatthew 8 verse 1 to 3   **\n1 When He was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. 2 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.\n 3 And Jesus put forth His hand, and touched Him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.    **\n'…And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. ''What is this verse saying? It is telling us that Jesus is for you. He loves you so much. He feels your hurts, your pains and he is willing to receive you. He is willing to forgive and to deliver you. He is willing to heal you. Jesus is stretching His hand of love and power towards you. He is saying you should come to Him for your deliverance. He is saying, “Come to Me for your deliverance from Satan, from sins, from sickness. He is ready to save you. What you need to do is genuine confession and repentance. Forsake your sins and evil eye and turn to Jesus for your salvation and deliverance. When that leper said, Lord, if Thou wilt, make me clean, Jesus immediately said, My son I am willing. How will I not be willing? I made you. I made you for the purpose of My glory. Leprosy has estranged you from people. I Am willing for you to come back to humanity, to mix with them and do My work, I want you to preach My gospel. I Am willing, My son. Be cleansed! And the man got cleansed immediately! \nFrom today, as you pray to God, believe you have it and check up for the answers. As you pray, always check your Christian life also. Believe that your sicknesses shall go away; demons shall fly away. Ask God to bless you indeed. But you also must fulfill the conditions for receiving blessings from God. You must repent of your wicked and evil life.   **\nActs 8 verse 20 to 23   **\n20\tBut Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. \n21\tThou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. \n22\tRepent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.\n23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.   **\n\nAre you bound by iniquity? Has the devil put bitterness in your heart? Has the devil put anger in your heart? Are you a sinner? The Lord is saying you must repent. He is ready to show you mercy. The Lord is willing to forgive you. Do not yoke yourself in witchcraft or occultism. These things bring damnation to you and your family. That is why the Lord is saying you should repent and change your life.   **\n\n8.5 Confession for Deliverance  **\n\nActs 19 verse 18 to 20  **\n18 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds. \n19 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men, and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.\n 20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.   **\n\nAll those magical things that you have, those properties of witchcraft that you carry about, or put in your body, be willing to confess them. The one you carry in your pocket determine to confess and let them go. The ones they put in coven for you, reveal them and renounce them. The ones you put in your box in your house, the ones injected into your blood, the ones you swallowed, confess them before God and before God's true servants for your deliverance. Those instruments of magic, instrument of witchcraft, of destruction, that you carry, the marijuana that you still have, the drugs, the ones you carry about, confess and throw those things away or burn them. If you do this, it is then you are looking for Jesus. It is then you are sorry of your sinful life. It is then you are looking for mercy and the Lord will forgive you. He will receive you. Then the Lord will command the devil out of your life because you are sincere. For he that hides his sin shall not prosper. If you hide your witchcraft, you will not prosper.   **\n\nYou might have been into witchcraft before becoming a church worker and even a preacher, and have been trying in vain to come out of it. You could not succeed because you hid it all this while. You have been managing your life in sin. You are like a man inside a pit, a terrible pit who cannot deliver himself. It takes a power outside the pit to deliver him. You are in the pit of the devil. Call for help from outside. Let your voice come out to the people outside to help you out of the pit. It is the people that are outside that can draw you out of that place. But if you keep silence in the pit because you see yourself as a ‘big man,’ you will die there. You will die and perish. So, confess your sins! Do so before the church and minister of God. If you are looking for salvation and deliverance from the Lord, then exercise faith in the Lord Jesus. Call upon Him for your healing and deliverance from every sickness and satanic operations. Believe that the prayer of His anointed servant in the name of the Lord Jesus will set you free and make you whole.  **\n\nMatthew 10 verse 1   **\n“And when He had called unto Him His twelve disciples, He gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. “   **\n\nI am a disciple and servant of Christ. He has given me power. I will speak, and the power of God will do it. I will command and the power will do it. That is, believe that it shall happen through the servant of God for your life. And you will see it come to pass in Jesus name.   **\n\n Mark 16 verse 15, 16   **\n15 And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. \n16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.    **\nIf you are not yet baptized in water, having met the requirement to be baptized, and you are boasting that you are a Christian, remember that if you die you are not going to heaven. Being not baptized, you are not obeying this command. ...He that believeth and is baptized... If you have believed, why are you not baptized? It is disobedience. If you have truly repented of your sins and accepted Christ, what is your reason for not being baptized? Do not play with water baptism. If you have believed in Christ but were not baptized correctly or have been baptized when you were an unbeliever or infant, now that you have believed or reached the age of majority, get baptized. That is the will of God for you.  **\n\n Mark 16 verse 17 to 20   **\n17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In My Name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; \n18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. \n19 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, He was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. \n20 And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.    **\n\nThe Lord will give you signs. He will confirm His word in your life. He will hear and answer your prayers for yourself and others. Pray that the Lord may accompany your life and service with signs and wonders. Learn to testify and give glory to Jesus. Remember those nine lepers that were healed! None of them testified. None of them came back to thank God except one, who was a Samaritan. I pray that you will not be like them in Jesus name!   **\n\n 8.6 The Power of Faith to Heal.   **\n\n The Bible tells us about the power of faith that is in the name of Jesus to heal the sick     **\nActs 3 verse 16    **\n“ And His name through faith in His name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know, yea, the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.”   **\n\n '...Perfect soundness…' Perfect soundness will be your portion always through Jesus Christ our Lord if you believe according to the word of God. You need strong faith to enable you tap into the word of God and receive from the power in it. Your faith shall bring you deliverance.\n\nIf you are a sinner, you know yourself. Confess your sins and repent of them. Then, give your life to Jesus. Tell Him to come into your life. Promise Him you will not go back to your sin anymore. Tell Him to take over your life. Believe that He has come into your life. If you do so, you will be a child of God. The end. \n",

      "body": "LOVE, HEADSHIP & SUBMISSION IN MARRIAGE. The obedience God demands and the wisdom you need.  **\n\nINTRODUCTION    **\n This book, Love, Headship & Submission in Marriage, is written to strengthen the righteousness and holiness of Believers in a marriage Union, whatever challenges the marriage may bring. It is a deep exposition of the word of God on marriage highlights as     **\n(i)\tHeadship and Submission in marriage\n(ii)\tLiving the godly life before an ungodly marriage partner \n(iii)\tObedience to God's word and wisdom for holy living in marriage    **\nThe book is filled with knowledge, wisdom and power to make the believer overcome Sin, Satan and the flesh that hinder many married Christians from making heaven. Get this book as a gift across to many and promote God's righteousness and holiness in the marriage union and family life of Christ's followers. The book shows the believing wife the kind of obedience she is expected to offer to her husband. She must submit her life in obedience to her husband as the true and righteous church does to Christ. Her submission and obedience to her husband must be in righteousness. She must not yield to her husband in his sinful demands and commands because of her honor to her Superior Lord and Master Jesus Christ. The husbands likewise are instructed to love their wives as Christ also loves the church. He must love her with passion and sacrifice as Christ did to the Church.    **\nEphesians 5 verse 22 to 27     **\n 22. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.\n 23. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the body.\n 24. Therefore as the church is subject to unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. \n25. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it. \n26. That he might sanctify it and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word. \n27. That he might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.   **\nThe book is full of new insights and words of wisdom that thrill the reader and persuade you, compel obedience to God’s word and holy living in marriage.   **\n \nCHAPTER 1    **\nHEADSHIP IN THE FAMILY    **\nBy headship, I mean the one leading and overseeing the home, the pastor over the house, and the Commander-in-chief. This is the man or husband. God gave him headship by creation, in Christian marriage and the home.    **\nfirst Corinthians 11 verse 3 to 5   **\n3But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. \n4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. \n5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head,  for that is even all one as if she were shaven.  **\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 3   **\nMentions three heads; God as head over Christ, Christ as head over the man, and the man as head over the woman.   **\n1.1.\tGOD, THE HEAD OF THE TRINITY   **\n The Father is the head of the Trinity  The Father, the Son Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Though they are one and equal, we see here in the redemption design that the Father is the head of Christ. When Jesus came to the world, He clearly showed that the Father was His head. The Father was the authority that sent Him. He showed it very clearly. The leader of the Godhead, though one person, is the father. \nHeadship was revealed to us through redemption. Someone must be the leader that commands actions. Others are the followers, although we know the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one Person.     **\n John 14 verse 28    **\n28Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved Me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father, for My Father is greater than I. \nMy Father is greater than I because He sent Me into the world for the purpose of redemption. I have put aside my equality with Him. I am here to do His will.  **\nPhilippians 2 verse 5 to 9   **\n5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; 6Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; 7But made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; 8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted Him and given Him a name which is above every name  **\n Jesus laid aside the rank of God He had with the Father from the beginning, took the form of a servant, and became obedient.    **\n1.2.\tJESUS’ SUBMISSION TO FATHER    **\n Something must be put away to achieve the desired result  and that was the form of God. The authority Jesus had as God, He laid aside. Why? He had become a man and had become a servant. He was subject unto the Father and became obedient and submissive to Him. You can see this submission from His utterance.    **\nJohn 15 verse 9 to 10    **\n9. As the Father hath loved Me, so have I loved you; continue ye in My love. 10. If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.    **\nThere is a reason the Father loves Me! He loves me because I keep His commandments. He is My head; He is My leader; He is My Overseer; He is My Captain; He is My Director. I receive loving care from the Father because I keep His commandments.    **\n John 15 verse 14 to 16    **\n Ye are My friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.  Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth; but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of My Father I have made known unto you.   **\nIs He not God to have spoken of Himself? Instead, He said, I have heard of My Father, I listen to My Father, I receive from My Father, I am doing all you see Me do by My Father. Can you see subjection to authority? He laid aside the form of God in Him. Now that He brought down Himself to the form of a man, He showed submission and obedience to the Father in action, life, and character.    **\nJohn 5 verse 37 to 44    **\n 37. And the Father Himself, which hath sent Me, hath borne witness of Me. Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape. \n38. And ye have not His word abiding in you, for whom He hath sent, Him ye believe not. \n39. Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of Me. \n40. And ye will not come to Me, that ye might have life. 41 I receive not honor from men. \n42. But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. 43 I Am come in My Father’s name, and ye receive Me not, if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. \n44. How can ye believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?    **\n He bore witness, saying, the Father sent Me. The greater sends, the lesser. You do not have His Word in you; because He sent me, but you are not receiving me. He authorized me, but you are not accepting my authority. I came in my Father’s name, in my Father's authority. That is why the early believers were baptized in the name of Jesus  the authority of Jesus, according to Matthew 28 verse 19.    **\nJesus is saying He came in His Father's name, which is to say, the Father sent me. I am doing all this in His authority, in obedience to Him. I am not doing anything in my name. The disciples were not baptizing people in their name but in the name of Jesus, who authorized them to preach because He had given them the authority.   **\nMatthew 28 verse 19    **\n Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost    **\nTheir baptism was not in their name or their authority, but in the name of Jesus  by the authority of Jesus. Jesus said, I came in my Father’s name, but you are rejecting me. I seek not my honor but that of my Father.    **\n1.3.\tWIVES MUST SUBMIT TO THEIR HUSBANDS     ** \n Jesus here speaks about how He behaves toward the Head over Him while on earth. The woman must exemplify Jesus’ language of submission. This character must be mirrored because Jesus is under the authority of the Father, as the woman is also under the man's authority.     **\nJesus says, “I have the Father as My head and submit to Him. Since I became a man and a Servant of God, I am lower than My Father, who is still on the throne as God. I obey and serve Him.’’ This is the godly character of a person under authority. You should seek the glory of your head and listen to your head. Do not do things in your authority. You do not do things in your power because there is a head over you. Always consult your head.     **\nThe husband is the head of the wife. In honor and submission to him, let the wife demonstrate her loyalty openly before the church, neighbors and family.     **\nJohn 14 verse 7 to 11    **\n7 If ye had known Me, ye should have known my Father also and from henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.\n8 Philip saith unto Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us. \n9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?\n10 Believest thou not that I Am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works. \n11Believe Me that I Am in the Father, and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the very works' sake.    **\n Here, Jesus speaks about equality and oneness with the Father. He further said, ‘’I am lower than the Father because I became man; otherwise, there is no difference between the Father and Me. The Father and I are one. I am a replica of the Father in all ways. By His life, words and action, Jesus showed clearly that the Father is the Leader or Head of the trinity as far as human redemption is concerned.    **\nFirst John 5 verse 7     **\nFor there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one.   **\n John 14 verse 28    **\n Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved Me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father,  for My Father is greater than I.    **\n1.4.\tTHE HEADSHIP OF CHRIST OVER THE MAN/HUSBAND   **\nWe also see the headship of Christ over man.    **\nfirst Corinthians 11 verse 3    **\n3 But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.    **\nShould the man behave the same to Christ as Christ behaves towards the Father? Yes, this is what it means. As Christ did to the Father, saying, “I am not here to show my glory, prowess, power, wisdom; I am here as one sent Man,” so should the man do in marriage and the family. You are not to show in the family that you are somebody all must tremble at or fear slavishly. You should say, “I am here as one the Lord has recognized and given the position of headship.”     **\n1.5.\tTHE HUSBAND OR FATHER MUST NOT BE DREADED OR WORSHIPPED    **\nThe man should not receive worship in the home. The man is not to treat family members, the wife, children, and occupants of the house as though they were his captives or slaves. The man must be careful to maintain gentleness in the family so that his wife should not become a slave, trembling before him. His children should not become slaves, trembling at the sound of his voice.    **\nMan, Christ is your head. Why should your family be bowing and worshipping you? Not that they should not bow in respect  there is a difference between bowing in respect and bowing in worship. Their respect for you should be in love and not by threat. Peter refused to be worshipped because he was a man. You, too, must resist it. Why does your family dread you? Why does your wife dread you? Why can she not talk, relate, or even reproof you for your wrongdoing? Why will you not accept it? Are you not a man? Have you become God? Because God set you over the woman, you become God? No!    **\nActs 10 verse 25 to 29     **\n25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. \n26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. 27 And as he talked with him, he went in and found many that were come together. \n2 8And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. \n29 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for, I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?    **\nPeter said, “I am a man like you.” God told me not to call you infidel, unclean, or one lower. So also, God says to you, husband, do not treat your wife according to the customs of men. Do not treat your wife according to the traditions of your tribe, race, or culture, and do not copy natural men in treating your wife as they do. She deserves respect, and honor, though under your headship. Fully submit to Christ who’s your head. Follow His word in your relationship with your wife.     **\nAs soon as you sent for me, Peter said, I came because the Lord asked me to go. That is why I have come; else, I would not have come. I do not do anything on my own. I do only what I see from the Lord, what I hear from the Lord. Whatever I do is not of my authority. I must ask the Lord. I do it by the Lord. Let the husband, therefore, yield to Christ fully in the family. Christ is your head  the head of the family. Some families have a portrait that says, Christ is the head of this home, the silent listener to all conversation. So always remember, Jesus is your head and will not be pleased with you if you take actions that do not bring Him glory. If you make demands that He does not want, He will not be happy with you.    **\n The children of Israel complained about Solomon after he died that he had made their service grievous. Solomon backslid, going after beauty and human glory and burdening people. He was no more looking to God to guide his ways. He was going after the desires of his heart instead. But the people suffered for it. Likewise, when the husband backslides, the wife and family members suffer  the wife and the children suffer because he is no longer connected to God and does not receive instruction from Him. Husbands, receive your instructions from God. What you bring into the family should be what Jesus allows. The rules you bring into the family should be what the Word of God instructs. This will clearly show your family and others that you are under the headship of Christ, and then your marriage will stand the challenges of life if you obey and submit to Christ and rule them by God`s Word.     **\nLuke 6 verse 46 to 49    **\n46 And why call ye Me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?\n47 Whosoever cometh to Me, and heareth My sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like; \n48 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock, and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it  for it was founded upon a rock. \n49 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built a house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.  \n1.6.\tHEADSHIP OF THE HUSBAND OVER THE WIFE    **\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 3    **\n3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. \n The head of the woman is the man. As Christ submits to the Father, so should the man, the husband, do to Christ, and the woman, the wife, to the man (husband). That is the order. Has Christ ever disobeyed the Father?     **\nJohn 8 verse 29     **\n29And He that sent Me is with Me, the Father hath not left Me alone; for I do always those things that please Him.    **\n Jesus said, so does my Father love me because I always do those things that please Him. If you want to enjoy marriage, woman, always do those things that please your husband. Again, hear Jesus speak  “My Father loves me because I keep His commandments.”     **\n John 15 verse 10     **\n10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.    **\n Therefore, a woman must keep the commandments or instructions of her husband to provoke his love for herself. Disobedience to her husband provokes him to be angry with her. This hinders the free flow of love towards her. I seek not my glory but the glory of Him that sent me  Jesus Christ said.    **\n John 8 verse 50     **\n 50 And I seek not mine own glory, there is one that seeketh and judgeth.    **\nSeek the glory of your husband. Do not seek your recognition; seek the recognition of your husband. \nDo not magnify yourself in the family; instead, magnify your husband. That will make him know that you are submitting to his headship.    **\n Proverbs 31 verse 23   **\n Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.    **\nThis way, your husband will love you and promote you in the home and before men.     **\n Proverbs 31 verse 28 to 29      **\n28Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. 29Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.   **\n\n\nCHAPTER 2    **\nDISOBEDIENCE IN HEADSHIP    **\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 4     **\n4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.     **\nThis scripture tells us that there can be disobedience to headship. The man can dishonor his head, who is God or Christ, while the woman can dishonor her head, that is, the husband. Christ never dishonored His head, God the Father.   **\n2.1. DISHONOUR TO CHRIST BY THE HUSBAND    **                         \nWho is the head of the husband? Christ is his head. But it can happen in a marriage where the husband dishonors Christ. \nMany testimonies and accounts of disobedience to Christ by men abound. Here it is in the physical sense. If the man is in the church for worship and covers his head with a cap, a hat, or cloth, he is saying he is not under Christ; he is not submitting to Christ. It means he has covered Jesus, his head, and is depriving Jesus of being seen and honored by men in his life. Eventually, he is saying, “I cover the presence of Christ, I cover the glory of Christ, I cover the authority of Christ in this place, I remain alone.” That is what it implies when a man covers his head in the church or during prayer. It is the same as when some people come into your room, and you take a piece of cloth and cover something so they should not see. That is precisely what a man does to Christ when he puts a cap, hat, or cover on his head during prayer or church worship.   **\nIn the spiritual sense, many men dishonor Christ when they reject the control of Christ in their family. When your desire or authority supersedes that of Christ's in the home, you have dishonored Christ. When that which you require your wife or children to do for you is against what Christ instructs in scripture, you despise Christ. When you ask your wife or children to go beyond righteousness to the realm of evil, you have covered Christ. You are now saying, “I am the only one in charge in my family. I reject the headship of Jesus Christ over me.” \n When you ask the children to do something evil that Christ will not allow, you are saying, “You are not under Christ; you reject His headship. Christ never disobeyed His Father; He never spoke or took any action that would bring contempt to the Father. He never taught us to disobey the Father.    **\nLuke 18 verse 18, 19  **\n18. And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 19. And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? None is good, save one, that is, God.     **\nGive honor to the Father; recognize Him. See how Jesus gave honor to the Father? Why, then, man, do you dishonor Christ? Woman, why do you dishonor your husband? \nWhen you deny your husband the honor you should accord him, you disrupt the presence or impact of God in your family. When you fight, argue, shout, display carnality, boast, and curse your husband, you dishonor him, and by scripture, you have dishonored Christ. This is a direct rejection of the presence of righteousness in your marriage and family. \nHave you ever wondered how it would have been if Christ disobeyed His Father? How would it have been if Christ never did what pleased the Father? God would obviously not have been pleased with Him. Why aren’t you respecting Christ in your marriage and home? Why demand things that you know Christ would not support or approve?     **\nHow can you demand a kind of obedience that you know Jesus would not like? \nWhen you ask your wife for oral sex (to use her mouth, lips or tongue to stimulate your private part or anus), is that not disobedience to the authority and righteousness of Christ? Why do you blame her for denying you such obedience? Must she not be subject to Christ, your head?     **                                                                 \nWhen you perform acts with your wife which you should not in the sanctity of Christ, in the purity of Christ and speak words you should not speak, are you not dishonoring Christ? Indeed, He will not accept you; He will turn away from you and will not regard you. Now that you have dishonored Christ, what are you expecting to happen? Christian wives must not submit to their husbands when they demand obedience, leading them to sin against God, the Supreme One.   **\n 2.2. DISHONOUR TO THE HUSBAND BY THE WIFE   ** \nWomen also dishonor their head, the husband.   **\n First Corinthians 4 verse 5    **\nTherefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of  darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of God.  \n First Corinthians 11 verse 5  **\n5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonored her head, for that is even all one as if she were shaven.   **\n Every woman that prays with her head uncovered dishonors her head. What does that mean? You are dishonoring man, your head, which should not be done. Man is honored before God when the woman covers his headship by covering her head in the presence of God. To leave your head uncovered in worship and prayer means you want to tell God that man is equal to Him in glory and headship. That is an offence to God. You are supposed to cover man's headship and glory when you come before God. This is done by covering your head with a head tie.   **\nFirst  Corinthians 11 verse 7    **\n7For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.   **\nIn the presence of God, cover the glory of man. If you are not ready to do that, you dishonor the man by disobeying the order set up by the Lord, his head. You will even hear some women ask, “Why must I cover my head when the man is not covering his?” The man is not covering his head because the Lord told him to leave it uncovered. His open head is a physical way to show the presence of Jesus and His authority over such spiritual activities. Since man cannot control such moments, his presence and authority should be covered. This is done by covering the woman’s head with a head tie. To refuse to do this shows that you are neither subject to man nor God in your Christian life. This problem extends to some homes, where the woman competes with the man. “You leave your head uncovered, so I will also leave mine uncovered. That is competition, which is disrespect. You do not want to acknowledge that the man is greater than you and has been made your head by God Himself?    **\nJesus openly acknowledged the greatness of His Father over Him, saying, “My Father is greater than I.”    **\n John 14 verse 28    **\n28Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father, for my Father is greater than I.    **\nThe man should never take God’s glory. Let him learn from Christ and from Peter, too, as seen in the scripture below \nActs 10 verse 25 to 26    **\n25And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him.\n26But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.   **\n The woman should understand that she is the glory of the man and stop trying to compete with him. God gave the man a privilege above her. When the woman refuses and says, “No! Why must he be above me? When you challenge the man God authorized, you also challenge Jesus and the Father. It is a spiritual law.    **\nMatthew 10 verse 40    **\n40He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. If you obey your husband, it is God you are obeying.    **\nIf you submit to your husband, it is Christ to whom you are submissive. Can you see the chain? He that despises you despises me; he also despises the Father who sent me. Now that you are stubborn to the man and will not submit but struggle with equality, refusing to honor your husband, you are dishonoring Christ and the Father  The God who made you. When you have issues submitting to your husband, who is your head, speaking back at him when he speaks, thinking that you have the same authority, you are not following God’s order. God says that the man is the head of the woman. Obey God and submit to Him in all matters of righteousness and holiness. This is the will of God for you, woman. \nWhen a woman refuses to submit to her husband, she refuses to submit to Christ. When you speak back to the man, it is to Christ you are talking back. You are rebelling against Jesus when you refuse to obey a godly instruction from your husband. Do not think you are rebelling only against your husband. If you cannot obey your husband, whom you see with your own eyes, how can you obey Jesus, whom you do not see? When you obey your husband, you are obeying Christ. Who are you obeying when you cover your head? Get little in your own sight and obey your husband who also is under Christ.    **\nEphesians 5 verse 22 to 24    **\n22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.\n23For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church and He is the Savior of the body. \n24Therefore, as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.   **\nCan you see the position God puts your husband in the marriage and home? How then do you say, “I am going to heaven, whether Satan likes it or not,” yet sin against your husband? Who will give you heaven? You are not qualified for heaven! Jesus is the One who puts your husband in his position over you in marriage and the family. His Word says you should submit to your husband as unto the Lord. Your husband is the physical representation of Jesus. It is easy to examine whether you are going to heaven or not because you have a physical image or person in your husband as God’s representative. What you do to him determines where you will be. It determines where you will spend eternity. Write the exam and correct the paper; you will know whether you wrote well or not since you have the answer. Ask your husband whether you serve him well according to scripture to know your eternal fate. This is so if your husband is walking according to the scripture and demands from your scriptural obedience only. You can grade yourself. It is like doing exercises in a textbook, with the answers at the back of the book. When you answer one question, go to the back of the book and check if you got the answer right. Regarding your character, go to the back of the book and determine whether you got the answer right. Your husband is the back page of the book 34 that helps you to see whether you got the answer right, whether you are qualified for heaven. It is that simple. You may say the man's demands are too challenging. Jesus thought as much about the Father, but how did He respond? He said, “Father, this cup is terrible for me; it is heavy for me; I wish you could take it away from me.” But that was not the end because he also said, “Nevertheless, not my will, but thy will be done.”    **\nLuke 22 verse 42    **\n42 Saying, Father, if Thou be willing, remove this cup from Me, nevertheless, not My will, but Thine, be done.   **\n Even Jesus suffered. He would have wished as a man not to obey some demands the Father asked of Him, especially going to the cross. It was difficult for Him, but see the submission  ‘’Not my will, but Thine, be done! So, what are those things you are accusing your husband of? Will they kill you? Can you name them? Remember that Jesus obeyed the Father, even to the death of the cross! He submitted to the will of the Father. Practice costly obedience and win the lasting love of your husband.     **\n2.3. WHAT ABOUT MAN’S SUBMISSION TO CHRIST   **\n Is it easy? Consider the case of the apostle Peter, who, instead of standing courageously for Jesus, turned his back on Him in fear, denying knowing Him three times. The Lord did not give up on him. He reinstated Peter after His resurrection, empowering him to walk in obedience because there is no room for rebellion in our walk with God. It is not easy. Consider Paul’s sufferings. Consider the sufferings of the apostles. Who among them withdrew?   **\n James 5 verse 10 to 11   **\n 10 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience. \n11 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy.    **\nYou need to be patient with your husband. Patiently leave your husband in the hand of God. Endure hardship in your husband's hand even as Jesus Christ endured hardship in the hands of men.    **\n2.4. REASONS WHY MANY WOMEN SUFFER IN MARRIAGE   **\nSubmit to your husband. Hagar, why are you in the wilderness? I am running away from my mistress. Why? She was so hard on me. Why was she hard on you? Your character caused it. Go back and submit to her. You were stubborn to her; you despised her because you are pregnant, and she is not? So, you disdained her; you forget that you are a maid? Can pregnancy now give you leadership over her?    **\nGenesis 16 verse 8 to 9   **\n8And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? And whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.\n 9And the angel of the Lord said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.   **\nWoman, did you not cause that trouble in your life? Now your husband is having trouble with you. Life is difficult for you because he deals with you with an iron hand. Are you not responsible? Is it not because you despise and disdain him? Is that not why he treats you harshly? Sarah told Abraham  ‘’My sin be upon you. Why did you agree when I told you that you should take another woman, my maid? You knew it was because of my impatience I was putting pressure on you to marry my maid. Why did you not refuse? Did you not know that it would result in evil? Did God tell you to marry someone else? Is it not me who told you? Why did you agree? I hold you responsible for the evil that has come up between this lady and me.    **\nThis woman is giving me trouble here. I am going to deal with her. She saw she was pregnant and despised me; she downgraded me. I will deal with her. What did Abraham say? “Behold, your maid is in your hand. Is it not you who asked me to marry her? I have not belittled you because of her. You deal with her in a way you think will make her submit to you. I am not the reason for her pride over you. What a great lesson men and leaders should learn. Do not support the ideas of your wife or follower(s), no matter the pressure. Make sure it is the will of God.   **\nSo, woman, find out why things are the way they are in your marriage and home.  **\n 2.5. SUBMIT TO YOUR HUSBAND   **\nEphesians 5 verse 22 to 23  **\n22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. \n23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the Head of the church, and He is the Saviour of the body.   **\nChrist is the Savior of the body, not you! When you make statements such as, “I am the one buying food; I am the one paying the bills, buying clothes; I am the one paying my children’s school fees; the question is, why are you the one? How did you get the money? It is because you refused to submit the money you have to your husband to make him the one to do what needs to be done. Why did you keep the money? Are you the savior of the family? Is it not the money you made in that house, in that marriage? Are you not one with your husband?    **\nEphesians 5 verse 31    **\n 31For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.    **\nBecause you kept the money, you are calling your name over it. Did Jesus seek His glory? Why did you not submit the money to your husband? Why not do all those things in your husband's name? Why are you calling it your money? Why not call it your husband’s money?   **\n I am saying that by doing this, you refused to cover your head. By such action, you are saying, “My husband's head is bare; mine too will be bare. I will not cover it; I am as he is.” That is where the trouble is  insubordination. Learn submission, and you will find peace and eternal life. If you do this, your backsliding husband will come over; he will come back.   **\nWhen Naomi heard that the Lord had visited Israel, she returned to Bethlehem. Submit, and the Lord will visit you. You will see changes in your household; you will see changes in your husband. He will return to you to love and care for you.   **\n\nCHAPTER 3   **\nHEADSHIP OF CHRIST OVER THE FAMILY    **\n3.1. OBEDIENCE AND SUBMISSION IN THE FAMILY    **\nBoth parents have headship over children. The Christian family must recognize the headship of Christ and willingly submit to Him, and obey Him fully in all subjection. The household must recognize Jesus and submit to Him.   **\nMatthew 22 verse 37 to 39    **\n37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 38This is the first and great commandment. \n39And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.   **\nThe first thing a Christian family must dedicate itself to, is to love the Lord God with all their heart. God must come first and not the husband, wife, or children.  Thou shalt love the Lord thy God is the first commandment. So, first things first. Woman, it is the Lord your God first, not your husband. You should love him, but God first. The man should love his wife but secondary to Christ. Children should love their parents, but their first love should be for Christ. The first love of everyone in the family should be to the Lord God. Parents should cherish their children, which is the second commandment and should come after the first command.    **\nThe first is the Lord your God. If the family has Jesus as the head, they should love Him with all their heart, soul, might, and strength.    **\nThe husband's first duty in the family is to direct the love of the wife and children to God. Not to himself but God first. Not your will, but the will of God; because He is your Head. Jesus is your head; Jesus is your God. Let your first love be directed at Him. Do not stop your wife from loving the Lord. Give her time to worship God. It is one of the ways you will show your love for the Lord. Give her time to pray and study the scriptures and know her God. That is an expression of your love for God. Give her time to fellowship and attend conferences in her sincere love for God.    **\nGive your wife and children money for transportation or transport them yourself to Christian meetings. God must come first in everything, and our actions should reflect that. When your children are not serious in the house of God but are serious in school; when you spend much money to send them to school but leave them at home when it is time for fellowship, that reflects how misplaced your priorities are. First things first  Love God, direct them to the love of God.   **\nWife, you must put God first before your husband. Adam, why not God first? Why put your wife in the first place before God?    **\n Adam, God said you should not eat that fruit, but you have obeyed your wife to disobey God and have eaten. God first! Do not listen to your wife if it contradicts God’s Word. Do not mind her crying; otherwise, she will put her blame upon you as Sarah did. Abraham asked, “Were you not the one that advised me? Sarah answered, when you knew my advice was bad, why did you take it? Why did you take it when you knew my advice would lead you away from the will of God?” ‘But you were crying.’ “If I cry, will I not get tired? Have I cried in your house for 24 hours? Ignore my cry; do what God tells you. Now that you have not done it, it has become a problem at home.” God first, not your wife. Do not mind her crying, “I will leave this house; you do not love me…”    **\nGod first  God will bring her back if she goes because God would be on your side. Love God first, then your wife. Love is not divided. The way you love God will naturally flow to your wife. If you love God first, it will flow over to your wife. Likewise, if you, woman, loves God first, it will flow over to your husband. The love for your spouse will be pure because the love of God is pure. Similarly, it would flow fresh and pure to the children.   **\n Love God first, and then you can go ahead and love your wife and children, which is the second commandment.     **\nMatthew 22 verse 39   **\n39And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.   **\nAs a wife, you can love your husband after doing the first duty  to love the Lord. When you are connected to Him, the love will flow down. God is up; man is down. Throw love up to God, and it will fall on man. The Lord will allow it to fall on your husband and children as you throw love up to Him.     **\nGod first! The man must not contend with Jesus for headship. Since Jesus willingly gives His headship over the marriage and family, the man must not compete with Him for headship.   **\nMan, do not struggle for headship with Jesus. Leave your head open  uncovered. Jesus is the head. Do not wrestle with Jesus for glory in your home. You are the glory of Jesus. It is not the husband's will but Jesus’ that should be done in that home. As the Lord said to the Father, “Not my will but Thine,” you too should say to Jesus, “Not my will but Thine,” and your wife should say the same to you. This is headship and submission in marriage for your peace, joy, and blessing. Hence, all in the family must first obey the Lord Jesus, the rewarder of their soul. What do you have for your wife, man, that shall not die as the flower disappears in the burning heat of sunrise? What reward do you have? Can your reward cover her soul, that you want to remove her from Jesus, her Lord, her God, the rewarder? Since you want to turn her eyes from Jesus, can you give her eternal life? You want to remove her from the worship of Jesus; can you give your wife eternal life? Can you even give her peace of mind, can you heal her body, and can you protect her from Satan? Therefore, allow your wife to submit to the will of Jesus, not yours. Jesus is the rewarder of her soul; He is the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. Allow your wife to seek Him so that she can receive rewards, both earthly and eternal.    **\n3.2. ALLOW YOUR WIFE TO SUBMIT TO THE COURSE OF GOD   **\n Allow your wife to tithe; it is to her God and Master. Also, allow her to support projects concerning the name of Jesus, though you are to check to ensure she is not contributing to the detriment of your family’s welfare. Do not stop her from being kind. Do not stop her from being charitable. Do not threaten her so much that she hides her charitable actions from you, and it becomes a sin to her. Let your wife have the liberty in Christ to serve God and do righteousness. This is what the Lord demands from a true Christian husband.    **\nThe wife and children must not hesitate to prioritize obeying Jesus first, who is greater than the man in the home. They must be ready to deny the man submission and obedience if he contradicts Jesus. Yes, the Lord made him the head, but he should not try to lead his family against God, who gave him the authority. What then is your security if you are now obeying someone that shall die? After he has died, where will you go? With whom will he leave you if you abandon God to follow him? My husband has said I should not come to church; my husband has said I should not come to Holiness Revival Movement; my husband has said I should not leave the Catholic Church; my husband has said…, When he dies, where will 47 you be who forgo the eternal for the temporal? How can you turn your back on the everlasting God for a short-term man? Can you not stand? Deny him obedience in matters that contradict the will of God, the Word of God, and the commandments of the Father.   **\n3.3. GOD IS GREATER AND BETTER   **\nActs 4 verse 7 to 13    **\n7. And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this? \n8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, \n9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; \n10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. \n11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. \n12 Neither is there salvation in any other,  for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. \n13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.    **\nWhy are you afraid of your husband when he challenges you on matters of God; jewelry and ungodly hairdo? Why obey him when he tells you that you should dress in pants (trousers) and wear shorts to go out with him because he likes it? Why are you silent before that man that can die at any moment, talking as if he is better than God? Why are you not bold? Why are you afraid? Why do you hide the truth? Open your mouth because you have a father. God supported the three Hebrew children. The marriage that brought you together can end at any time. When the king of Babylon, Belshazzar, promised Daniel the position of being the third in command if he interpreted the writing he saw on the wall, Daniel did interpret the dream but told him to keep his gifts.    **\n Daniel 5 verse 16 to 17   **\n16 And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts, now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom. \n17 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.    **\nThe kingdom was taken away from the king, who died that night. What can your husband do? How long will he live that you want to give up Jesus for him? He can suddenly die in an accident or through any other cause. You can’t give  Jesus up for mortal men. Please do not allow the fear of men to stop you from speaking about Jesus to him.    **\nSee what the disciples said when asked by what name the sick were healed  “By the name of Jesus, whom you crucified. And we are telling you there is no other name, under heaven, by which man should be saved, except by the name of Jesus.”   **\nThey were shivering within themselves, saying, these people are bold; they have been with Jesus. Jesus was a brave man. The Lord is helping us train bold and courageous women, bold and brave wives, who will stand for Jesus and ignore the power of rebellious men.   **\nActs 4 verse 17 to 20    **\n17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name. \n18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. \n19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. \n20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.   **\nWoman, why are you bothered by the threats of your husband? Child, why are you worried that your father or parents will not pay your school fees? Must you go to school before you go to heaven? Woman, must you marry that man before you go to heaven? Have you not seen people come out successfully from the bondage of marriage and make it to heaven? For this reason, many prefer to stay unmarried.   **\nThe widow, Anna, stayed unmarried until she was eighty-four, after being married for only seven years. She spent Seventy-seven years loving and serving the Lord in fasting and prayers in the temple, and she eventually embraced Jesus, the God of eternity. Do you not want to embrace Jesus in heaven? Please know God well, so you will not give that much value to marriage. You may say, what will I do with my children? Jesus said, if anyone would come to me and will not forsake himself, herself, husband, wife, children, property, he is not fit to be my disciple    **\nLuke 14 verse 26 to 27   **\n 26 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. \n27 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. Does your husband really have the power to send you out? The Lord said the hairs on your head are numbered; none shall fall to the ground except the Lord allows it.    **\n Luke 12 verse 7 to 8    **\nBut even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.    **\n First Kings 1 verse 52    **\n52 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth; but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.    **\n3.4. BE BOLD AND COURAGEOUS BEFORE YOUR HUSBAND    **\nNone of your hairs shall fall to the ground except the Lord allows it for your blessing. A woman confessed adultery to her husband. In anger, he grabbed a knife, took her to the bedroom, threatened to kill her, and asked her to say her last words. The woman closed her eyes and said, “I owe mama Jemima  remember to pay her; remember this and remember that. I’m done. You can go ahead and kill me. He threw the knife down and began to cry. He is now serving with his wife in the faith and in Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide (HOREMOW)   ** \nHow do you want to convert the man if you are not ready to suffer? Do you give up after minor threats? Were not the apostles threatened? Their enemies had no power to kill them because God is higher and stronger than their power. Besides, they operated under an organized government that would query their actions. Your husband cannot go against God or the government of the nation to kill you. So why are you full of fear?    **\n Acts 5 verse 27 to 29     **\n27 An when they had brought them, they set them before the council and the high priest asked them, \n28 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? And, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. \n29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.     **\n Do not obey any of your husband’s demands that are contrary to scripture. Otherwise, you will reap evil rewards from God. You will explain to Him why you lifted your husband above Him, the Creator. Why have you made your husband an idol and cannot stand for Jesus? Obeying your husband against God will make you suffer in this life and the next life after death.    **\n Luke 9 verse 62    **\n62 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.    **\nRespect your headship and train your husband to respect God, his headship. He should respect Jesus by not demanding you to disobey Jesus’ word and order. The three Hebrew children said to king Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, we are not careful to answer you in this matter.” In other words, we do not need to defend ourselves before you. As our king, you are head over us. But there is one who is greater than you and your god. Our God will deliver us if you throw us into the fire. If He chooses that we should die, then you can go ahead. As for us, we will not obey you in this matter.    **\n Daniel 3 verse 10 to 18    **\n10 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image, \n11 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. \n12 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee, they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up. \n13 Then Nebuchadnezzar, in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king. \n14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?\n15 Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well, but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands? \n16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. \n17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. \n18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.    **\nWhy don’t you tell your husband, who exalts marriage above life, the same? Why are you afraid because he has threatened to put you away? What is marriage? Is it the best thing women are enjoying outside Christ? What glory do they have? You will be surprised to hear that many women wish they stayed out of marriage to serve Jesus. To behave as if you are an orphan without a God is sinful. If you have God, and your husband sends you away, know that he is sending you to God. God likes that challenge because if you stay righteous, He will pick you up and shame that man. He will not abandon you.    **\nPsalm 27 verse 10    **\n10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.  **\n In other words, God, in His righteousness, will take care of me when my husband forsakes me.    **\n3.5. THE HUSBAND’S HEADSHIP MUST BE RECOGNIZED     **\n Ephesians 5 verse 22 to 24, 33    **\n22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. \n23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, and he is the saviour of the body. \n24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. \n33 Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.    **\nThe headship of the man over his wife and the family must be recognized and willingly submitted to and obeyed. The woman must obey her husband in all things that do not contradict obedience to Jesus. Submission to her husband must be as unto Christ.    **\nWould you speak to Jesus rudely? Would you slap, spit upon, or pour water upon Jesus? If Jesus were lying down narrowly, would you look at him despitefully? Would you deny Him food? Would you take Jesus to the world and crucify Him with criticism? Would you speak evil of Jesus? Why do you do so of your husband? Here is an insight into one kind of woman. While gathered, some women were criticizing their husbands. Each took turns. The woman whose husband had been good to her had no bad report. She thought, if I tell these women my husband has been good to me, they will envy me. So, she joined them with made-up criticism. She was not ready to give God glory for what her husband was doing for her. She felt the need to belong, to be accepted, even while in the congregation of demons. What took you there? Why are you among wayward women to the point that they are making you call good evil? Woe to them that call good evil.   **\n Isaiah 5 verse 20 to 21  **\n20 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!  **\nThe Lord has been good to you. He gave you a good husband and gave you a good life. But just because you must please sinners, you speak foolishness. Is that gratitude to God for what He did for you? You prayed, and the Lord gave you a good husband, yet you want to disdain and embarrass him. Do not follow the customs of this life.   **\nWhen a man spoke about his wife, he said she criticized him for not loving her and never buying clothes for her. Another man asked if women are programmed to be so because his wife does the same. Are they not able to speak good about their husbands? That is the way of the world. Stop that sort of complaining; otherwise, the Lord says, I have heard as you have said. That is the type of murmuring that deprived the children of Israel the Promise Land. Appreciate what God is doing for you.     **\n Both men and women should learn to appreciate one another and what God is doing in their life. Why do you say to him, “I regret marrying you?” Is that the same man you testified to people to that you are now expressing regret? What things has the man done that has caused you to regret? Can you count them? Why would you condemn your husband just for one mistake? Is the man not striving, perfecting holiness, and not learning more in Christ? Stop the things that provoke spouses to anger and ruin a marriage. Speak good of your spouse.    **\n Ephesians 4 verse 29    **\n29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.   ** \n3.6. THE SUBMISSION DEMANDED FROM WIVES    **\nEphesians 5 verse 22 to 24    **\n 22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. \n23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, and he is the saviour of the body. \n24Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.  **\nTake note of the fact that you must submit IN EVERYTHING. The Lord expects you to obey ALL the commandments as you are in Christ. Because you are married, the Lord expects you to obey ALL the commandments of your husband.  **\nFirst Peter 3 verse 5 to 7  **\n5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands\n6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. \n7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.   **\n\nSarah called Abraham, Lord! That shows the degree of honor she had for her husband. It shows the degree of humility she exercised toward her husband. She did not just call him lord but showed it in her actions by obeying his advice even when it was inappropriate. This is proof that she respected her husband.    **\nIn your case, do not sin against God in your obedience to your husband; exercise this degree of honor and respect. Exercise it in your words and actions. That is what God expects or demands of you. Cover your head. Do not be proud, do not say you are equal with him. Whatever your degree, qualifications, or financial status is, cover your head. Do not allow your head bare as the man. Understand this, practice it. Children, too, should be obedient and submissive to their father; this is their duty.    **\nThe wife must not accept the undue authority of the husband over her, which would lead her to sin and rebellion against Christ, their supreme head. She must resist this unto separation. She must not usurp the husband’s authority in the home, which God forbids. The unbelieving woman would want to hold her husband down, using natural and unnatural witchcraft powers. Believers must ensure that they marry believers. For a woman to consider her husband common is sinful.   **\n First Timothy 2 verse 12 to 14    **\n12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.\n13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve. \n14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.    **\nThe woman, Eve, forwarded herself and contracted Satan in the garden. Remember the control of your husband to save yourself and your family from the fall. Satan knew he would not have deceived Adam, so he went to Eve.    **\nYou are now on top of family affairs while your husband follows you. That family will crumble because God did not give headship to you. Even devils know this. Satan respects man because it is the ordination of God. Woman, yield to your husband; do not belittle his understanding because he is gentle and quiet; give room for him to exercise his authority; listen to him.    **\n“I listen to My Father, hear from My Father, and declare what I hear from My Father.’’ That is what Jesus said. Follow His example. Don’t be talkative. You can’t be a good listener when you talk too much. You are usurping authority. The way to heaven is narrow; many women miss it in this backsliding age.    **\n\nPART II  **\nLIVING THE GODLY LIFE IN MARRIAGE WITH AN UNGODLY PARTNER (SPOUSE)  **\n\nCHAPTER 4   **\nMARRIAGE TO AN UNGODLY PARTNER   **\nIf you are a believer and your marriage partner is not, something is wrong. What is that? You have married an unbeliever. How can you still be godly? How can you be holy and qualified for the rapture? How can you succeed with this unbeliever? The same principles do not control your unbelieving spouse as you are. This is the root cause of your difficulties. The Bible tells us not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers.   **\nSecond  Corinthians 6 verse 14 to 16    **\n14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers, for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness? \n15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? \n16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.    **\nWhat brought you to this relationship? We cannot say come out of the marriage. It is a union that has joined you together until death.   **\n 4.1. REASONS FOR UNGODLY MARRIAGES    **\nWhat brought you into this ungodly marriage relationship? The following may account for this.    **\n4.1.1. YOU MARRIED BEFORE CONVERSION TO CHRIST     **\n Two of you were unbelievers, so you were at liberty to marry without divine guidance. You married as a sinner and got converted while in the marriage. You are saved, but your spouse is not. In such a case, you are in marriage union to an ungodly person.  **\n 4.1.2. YOU MARRIED IN CHRIST, BUT YOUR PARTNER BACKSLID AFTER MARRIAGE   **\nBoth of you were in the light, following the truth, adhering to the scriptures, serving God, worshipping God, and believing the bible. The bible controlled you, but later, your partner backslid. Now you begin to ask what has happened. He was carried away by temptation. It started on a good foundation but has ended now, with you alone maintaining your righteousness. Praise God you remain in Christ. But he has left Jesus and is now with Satan. He is currently in the darkness bringing you torment and sorrows.   **\n4.1.3. YOU MARRIED IN CHRIST BUT TO ONE NOT TRULY CONVERTED  **\nYou were deceived. Maybe you did not pray well or thought the person was of God because she was active in the church, teaching, preaching, and evangelizing but was not truly converted. The feelings of your body moved you; you walked by sight or were in haste and did not pray through. You did not have enough time to pray effectively for marriage, so you picked her or accepted him because you are together in choir and evangelism team. But now, you know that she is not truly converted. He that is born of the flesh is flesh. She cannot pursue righteousness because she is of the flesh. Those of the flesh cannot please God; it is not possible. \nRomans 8 verse 8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.  **\n4.1.4. YOU PURPOSELY MARRIED AN UNBELIEVER THINKING OF CONVERTING YOUR PARTNER   **\nYou are among those who believe they can convert people and wrongly think they have the power of conversion. You think you are a spiritual machine that can convert anything to powder; you can mold powder into solid, turn water into gas, or condense gas into solid. You said, “…give me anyone, and I will handle him.” Are you wiser than God? You did not consider the scripture. So God allowed you like the prodigal son. You backslid. But thank God, mercy brought you back to righteousness. You have gotten the husband you wanted. How is your husband? He is doing well, but life is not okay. He is an unbeliever; you have discovered that all your principles, power, and strategies to convert him are not working. You are face to face daily with an unbeliever!    **\n4.1.5. YOU WERE FORCED BY A CIRCUMSTANCE TO MARRY.  **\nMaybe you backslid and slept with a lady, she got pregnant, and you were pressured or obliged to marry her. It was a temptation you fell into. Yes, you followed through into marriage; you yielded to external pressure and married. Now you got restored, but you have an unbelieving wife.   **\n 4.2. WHO IS AN UNBELIEVER?    **\n Second Corinthians 6 verse 14 to 16   **\n14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers, for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? \n15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?\n 16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.    **\n That word is higher than a mountain, deeper than a valley, wider than the desert. Let's have an idea of who an unbeliever is. What type of sin does the unbeliever commit? The unbelieving marriage partner has the liberty to commit the kind of sins he wants because he is not under the control of God. He does not know Jesus. He does not know the Holy Spirit, the truth, or the way.   **\n Ephesians 2 verse 11 to 12    **\n11 Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands; \n12 That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world    **\nThe unbeliever is yet uncircumcised in the heart; the heart has not been tampered with the power of righteousness. He does not know Jesus. Jesus is not Lord and Savior to your marriage partner. He is not aware of the promises of God, the promises of judgment that make people aware of sin and avoid it, promises of blessing that will make people want to serve God. He is not aware of heaven and hell. He does not know hell and is not bothered about it. She is not afraid of hellfire. She has no hope of heaven and is not looking forward to going to heaven, for whosoever has this hope purifies themselves. She has no hope of inheriting any mansion in heaven. To her, God does not exist. God does not control her; she has no fear of God and is not serving God.    **\nWho is an unbeliever? What does the scripture say? The unbeliever is unrighteous. They take pleasure in unrighteousness, in doing what is wicked and not good, what would hurt your life and bring you to shame, disgrace, and much more.    **\nThe unbeliever is darkness. How do you walk with darkness? How do you live in darkness, where there is no light? How do you live in a home with no light, no candlelight? When the light of the day arises, it does not reach your home. Be not unequally yoked! You, who are not yet married, take this seriously.    **\nThe unbeliever is Belial, or Satan, a child of Satan. The one you need to contend with in that marriage is Satan. Your spouse belongs to Satan and works for him. God has not yet conquered your spouse! The deeds of Satan he will do.    **\nThe scripture below shows some of the things the unbeliever practices     **\nGalatians 5 verse 19 to 21    **\n19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, \n20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, \n21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like, of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.    **\nThe unbeliever is in the flesh. They serve idols and practice witchcraft which they were maybe introduced to from childhood. They have hatred in their hearts and lack real love  they are controlled by the spirit of competition in the house because no one must be greater than them. They drink and get drunk, vomit, fall on the ground and fight, dance and kill. The unbeliever has the tendency to do these things. Their conscience may not condemn them because they do not know God or the scriptures.    **\nThe Bible warns that the believer should not marry an unbeliever. The unbelieving spouse is bound to commit these sins because of the presence of sin in his life. Such as  adultery, idolatry, drunkenness, lying, witchcraft, hatred, anger, disobedience, polygamy, polyandry, and wickedness. Stealing is part of their lifestyle, and the truth is far from them. How can you live with someone who does not tell the truth?    **\n With all these challenges, what is God’s moral demand on His children that must be kept? God does not want you to consider having an unbelieving marriage partner.    **\n\nCHAPTER 5   **\nGOD’S DEMANDS IN MARRIAGE   **\nwhat are God's demands in your life irrespective of who you are married to?   **\n5.1.1. DO NOT FASHION YOUR LIFE AFTER YOUR FORMER WAYS   ** \nDo not live as you lived in the past.   **\nFirst Peter 1 verse 14    **\n 14As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance    **\nDo not live the type of life you lived when you were ignorant of God and did not know Jesus. You could fight or scheme evil and beat your partner then. You must stop such practices as a believer because you are a new person.    **\n Second Corinthians 5 verse 17    **\n 17 Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.   **\n Do not, therefore, fashion your life after the past. If you want to maintain your victory as a child of God, do not get angry, do not fight, and do not be abusive. Do not use charms to make your partner love you. You can no longer do that; you are now in Christ.    **\n5.1.2. PUT ON THE NEW MAN    **\nIn the presence of your unbelieving partner, live the life of the new man that you are in Christ Jesus. In those days, you used to fight, and you used to exchange blows. You knew how to deal with your husband while he was asleep. But you cannot do that anymore because you have put on the new man.    **\nEphesians 4 verse 23 to 32    **\n23And be renewed in the spirit of your mind; \n24And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. \n25Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour, for we are members one of another. 26 Be ye angry, and sin not. Let not the sun go down upon your wrath; 27 Neither give place to the devil. \n28 Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the \n73 thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth. \n29 Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.\n30 And grieve, not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. \n31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice; \n32 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.    **\nEven if your partner does not fear God, does not obey you, does not love you, practices evil, and abuses you in the presence of friends and children, you must put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. You must be righteous and holy in the presence of your marriage partner and the evils performed. Speak the truth with your spouse. Do not pretend you have money when you do not have money. Lie no more.     **\nWhen your spouse provokes you, please do not get angry and speak forth in abusive ways. As a woman, do not deny your husband food. Follow the scriptural instruction that says that if your enemy is hungry, feed him; give him water to drink if he is thirsty.     **\nRomans 12 verse 20 to 21    **\n20 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink, for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.   \n 21 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.    **\nAs a husband, do not deny your wife money for food because you are unhappy with her. Whether she gives birth to children or not, you must feed and clothe her. It is your godly responsibility. In the Old Testament, the Lord told Hosea to marry a harlot. God instructed him to bear with her sins and evil character. As an Israelite, the harlot was eligible for marriage by being a covenant child. This cannot be done today because not every professed Christian is a child of the covenant.    **\nWhen your spouse steals your money, do not steal your spouse's money or anything in retaliation. Do not hide your expenditures from one another. You are a new creature (verse 28).    **\nWith all her stubbornness, speak words of blessing reflecting Christ in you. Do not spew insults at your partner. That is corrupt language. If your unbelieving spouse talks to you that way, do not reply. Please do not say anything to stir him further into anger. Whatever your unbelieving partner does to you is not worse than hell. Please do not join them in their unrighteous behavior. \nDo not respond to the corrupt language of unrighteousness. You have no alternative but to pursue righteousness in your marriage and family (verse 29).   **\nYou are sealed. Do not take any step that the Holy Spirit will not want, resulting in Him being grieved and eventually leaving you (verse 30). Be kind. Do not carry the offence of last year, last month, last week, yesterday, to today (verse 31). It would help if you learned to forgive your partner. When you travel, return with a gift to show your love and thoughtfulness even while you are apart (verse 32).  **\n 5.1.3. YOU MUST LIVE IN LOVE   **\nYou must learn to live in love with your unbelieving partner.    **\nFirst John 4 verse 7 to 8    **\n7 Beloved, let us love one another for love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. \n8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.   **\nIf you love everyone except your unbelieving partner because of her behavior towards you, you have failed as a child of God. He that loveth not is not of God; is not born again. If you go to a house and hear the man speak lies to his wife, then that means Christianity has been affected. Speak the truth to your wife. Be kind and compassionate to her. Abstain from all appearances of evil. Abstain from anything evil or having evil intent.    **\nFirst Thessalonians 5 verse 22   **\t \nAbstain from all appearance of evil.    ** \nMay the Lord provide you with grace if you are married to a drunkard because you will have to cope with the stench of drunkenness. You have to bear it because you cannot deny your spouse your body even though she is an unbeliever or a womanizer. Please do not say I will not eat her food; I will not give him my body.   **\n5.1.4. BE HOLY AS GOD IS HOLY   **\n First Peter 1 verse 14 to 17   **\n14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance; \n15 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; 16 Because it is written, Be ye  holy; for I am holy. \n17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear  **\nDo not live with your marriage partner in fear. Timidity or a fearful heart will make you compromise with him and make him push you off from the boundary of righteousness. \nEven if you find your spouse compromising with another person, for example, coming home and seeing that he has an extramarital relationship, make sure you do not shift from righteousness. Shine as a light over that darkness or challenge in your marriage.    **\nPhilippians 2 verse 15 to 17    **\n 15That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;\n16 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. 17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.    **\nAs a husband, you must remain blameless before your wife. Do not be an instrument in Satan’s hands to hurt her. As a child of God, you are to be clean and serve as the light.   **\n As a wife, you must ensure that you have not taken any action to hurt, poison, kill, criticize, or spread his mistakes around society. Do not gossip or backbite him. That is evil and cannot bring a solution to the problem. The man will accuse you of tarnishing his reputation. Telling all your friends and relations your husband's weaknesses will not help the situation. Hold forth the word of life; practice this word of life  doctrines of righteousness and truth. Your righteousness must remain perfect in your attitude towards your spouse and children.    **\nWhy are we teaching this? We are doing so to keep you from laboring in vain. We do not want to shepherd people who will not go to heaven. We do not want to work, teach, pray and fast for people who will not go to heaven. We pray that God will deliver you from every kind of sin and evil.    **\n5.2. INSTRUCTIONS TO THE WIFE OF AN UNGODLY HUSBAND   **\nWhat does God say to you who are married to an unbelieving husband?     **\n5.2.1 OBEY YOUR HUSBAND IN ALL THINGS.   **\n Here is what the scripture says.    **\n First Peter 3 verse 1 to 5   **\n Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; 2 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. \n3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; \n4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. \n5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands   ** \nThe holy women do face challenging situations, but they trust in God. Your husband may not be a believer or he is of another religion. He is a 100% sinner, doing the unthinkable evil; you still have the responsibility to obey him.    **\nPractice righteousness and holiness as you live with your husband. Respect him even in his sin or evil. Live righteously so that as he watches your life, even though not appreciating you, God who is with you will convict him by your life. The Lord must pass through you to convert him. Do not think that if you dress the way he wants, as an unbeliever, or if you do your hair the way women do in the world, you will win him over. If you do that, you will displease God, the only person who can convert your husband and deliver him from Satan.   **\n If you go the way of sin, you will miss it. That is why the above scripture says you cannot win him by plaiting your hair with ungodly hairstyles. The holy women of old, who suffered the same condition as you, never overcame their situation that way. They did not overcome their predicaments by wearing gold or jewelry before their husbands.    **\nPutting on fancy apparel or exposing your body through the way you dress will not help either. You might say, “Is he not looking for naked women? So, I will dress to win him over. Doing so will mean you are living for your husband, not God.  **\nUnfortunately, he is too familiar with your soup and now wants soup cooked by another woman. So whichever way you garnish your soup is not the answer. It is the grace of God only that will save him. Maintain the way of truth, righteousness and holiness in your relationship with him so that God Himself will intervene in your case.   **\nThat is why your adornment should be the hidden man of the heart. That is the righteousness that pleases God.\nYour husband may disdain it, but it pleases God. You must beautify your heart with that which is not corruptible Do not adorn your body with ornaments thinking that you will make yourself more beautiful before your husband, to be accepted and cherished by him. Satan is fighting you through your husband, and you cannot overcome him by following the way of the flesh. Your adornment should be the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit. What a beautiful thing to have a quiet, gentle and humble woman! It will break the man; it will humble him. When you are down, to come down to you, your husband must bend down. Therefore, you pull him down to yourself with your humility. You must have a meek and quiet spirit; this spirit does not speak back; it does not answer harshly. Be as quiet as Jesus before the judgment tribunal. They marveled at his quietness to his honour.  **\nPresent godly character, and God will use it on your husband for his salvation because the holy women of old lived this way. They dressed modestly, not flamboyantly, not with jewelry, not in nakedness. They did not depend on the styles or hairdos according to the world's fashion. Is that what your husband wants when you put on fake Chinese and Indian hair? This is not the way of scripture. Follow God’s way as stated in scripture, and God will come your way for your salvation, protection and comfort.   **\n 5.2.2. DO NOT DIVORCE, EXCEPT FOR SEPARATION, DUE TO UNBEARABLE SITUATIONS.    **\nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 10 to 13    **\n10And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband, \n11But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband, and let not the husband put away his wife. \n12But to the rest speak I, not the Lord, If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. \n13And the woman which hath a husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.    **\nNote the difference between Apostle Paul’s advice and the commandment of the Lord. He gave the commandment of the Lord first in verses 10 and 11. But to the rest, he gave advice, not a commandment from the Lord.   **\nIf any man has an unbeliever as a wife, he should not divorce her because she is a drunkard, witch, adulterer, or whatever sin she willfully commits. Because she is an unbeliever, she can commit any sin, including adultery. Those who say if your wife commits adultery, you should put her away do not understand the scripture. The same applies if the man is the adulterer. If the man still desires to live with you as your husband, the Bible is clear  do not divorce him.    **\nIf your wife dresses worldly, wearing pants (trousers), wearing the hair of demons, but she is still willing to remain in the marriage, cook for you, give herself to you, or take care of your children, do not send her away.    **\nWhat if you have a husband who does not know God and does not want to know God but chooses to stay married to you? Do not think you have to leave him to serve God. Has the man asked you to leave? You do not have to go. According to his unbelief, he may even take in more wives, a second, third, or fourth, making you share him with other women; you may have to wait two weeks for him to make his rounds before getting to you. If he is still willing to be your husband, you do not have to manifest anger and pride and leave the marriage.   **\n That is Paul’s counsel to you, and it is scriptural counsel. Next, he gives reasons why the spouse should not leave.   **\n First Corinthians 7 verse 14 to 15    **\n14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband, else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. \n15 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases; but God hath called us to peace.    **\nGod is in you; Jesus is in you. As a result, the people in that house find themselves in the presence of the Lord. He can touch them at any time. God is also laboring with you. When your fellow brethren visit your home and share the Word, your husband benefits, though he may not seem to be paying attention. He is better off than a sinner who does not hear the Word. The presence of God, therefore, covers him too. If it is raining, the shelter God provides for you will protect him too. Witches and wizards cannot harm him because you are there. He is protected.   **\n Similarly, your presence is a blessing to your unbelieving wife because the presence of the Lord covers her. She is in the presence of the Lord because of you. When your brethren visit you and her, they will greet her, share with her, bless her, and pray for her. So, please do not send her away. She will respect you and be willing to stay in the marriage when she observes your righteous and holy life and sees that you do not respond harshly to her sins.    **\nWhat happens to the children if she leaves? She may take them with her, and the children will go into utter darkness. If she is a Muslim, you will lose the children entirely. If she leaves, she takes them to the bondage of Islam. But if she stays with you, they get to hear the Word, pray with you and copy many other godly attitudes, and may be converted to Jesus.    **\nWhy do you want to send the woman away? Why do you want to leave the man? It will affect the children. The man may go with the children or take you to court for the children. The courts may grant him custody of the children, and you lose them. Therefore, stay with the man since he is willing, or for the sake of the children that may be saved in Christ because of your presence.    **\nVerse 15 advises that if the unbelieving partner wants to leave, let them leave for the sake of peace. Allow the prodigal son to go. Why must he disturb you to the detriment of your peace when God has called you to peace? If your husband regularly abuses you, hits you, terrifies you, and then asks you to leave, please, go and have your peace; otherwise, you will not be able to practice the Christian life because you will be constantly harassed and tempted. One day you will get to the point of fighting back, exchanging blows, and may even succeed in overcoming him physically. But your Christianity will be gone. Leave, and God will take care of you.   **\nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 16   **\n16 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?    **\nWhy continue to subject yourself to torture, pain or suffering? Leave  but you say “I want him to get converted.” Who told you that you would eventually succeed in converting your partner? Is it everyone that gets converted? Not everyone will be converted. You have relations you have been preaching to and laboring for their salvation. Many of your parents died in their sins, despite your efforts. Have they been converted? Allow your spouse to go so you can save yourself.   ** \nShe can return if she leaves and gets converted tomorrow like the prodigal son. Allow her to go and learn the experiences of life that may lead to her repentance. It is wise to allow the prodigal son to go. If you leave the man and he gets converted tomorrow, he can come back for you. You may have him again.    **\nA woman who separates from her husband cannot marry again while he is still alive. He may get converted and desire you back. Therefore, you are not allowed to marry someone else. If you marry another man, you will be considered an adulterer before God.   **\n Romans 7 verse 2 to 3    **\n2 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. \n3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress, but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.   **\nThe meaning of this is that the moment a married woman gets converted, she must leave the second marriage and return to her husband so that she is no more an adulteress. So, she may come back as the prodigal son did. He said I will return to my father and confess that I have sinned against God and him. As a result, the husband must not remarry again if his wife leaves him.    **\n Likewise, like the prodigal son in a far country, the husband might meet with God and return to the wife. She is not to marry but to stay separate according to God’s Word. The reconciliation may or not be possible. The believer should remain single to serve the Lord according to His will and grace.\nThese are God's commands for husbands and wives in cases where one is a believer and the other is not. Husband, love your wife, and wife, obey your husband in all things.    **\n\n\nCHAPTER 6   **\nPRACTICAL DEMONSTRATIONS OF WIFE AS SERVANT AND HUSBAND AS MASTER   **\nSarah called Abraham lord and master. There is servant to master relationship between the wife and the husband. Christ took the form of a servant to do the will of His Father, the head of the Trinity   **\nPhilippians 2 verse 7    **\n7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men   **\nThe wife must also take the form of a servant to enable her to serve her husband and do his will joyfully. Similarly, Christ is the head of the man, but to serve and save them from sin and Satan, He made Himself a servant to men.    **\nJohn 13 verse 12 to 15   **\n 12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? \n13Ye call me Master and Lord  and ye say well; for so I am. \n14 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.\n 15 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.    **\nSimilarly, the husband is the master over his wife but must demonstrate Christ-like life of humility and servanthood before his wife to save her from sinful habits and disobedience.   **\n 6.1. THE SERVANT LEADERSHIP OF THE HUSBAND    **\nThe husband is a servant to Christ and a Master to his wife. As a servant to Christ, he must obey Christ’s command toward his wife. \nThere are attributes of righteousness for a servant master who lives in peace and harmony with his wife and makes it to heaven.    **\n 6.1.1. SELF-SACRIFICE    **\nMatthew 20 verse 28    **\n28 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.    **\nChrist came to minister, to give His life as a ransom, paying the ultimate sacrifice of our sins. To be the Savior of the world, He willingly gave Himself up, enduring the cross unto death. For the man to be the savior of the family, he must be willing to give himself entirely to his wife and family.    **\nIt is your responsibility as the man to supply the needs of the home. Failure to do this makes you disobedient to Christ, your Master.    **\nFirst Timothy 5 verse 8    **\n8 But if any provide not for his own, and especially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.  **\nJoyfully give yourself to your wife and children by supplying their needs whether you are assisted or not, even though good wives willingly support their husbands in family affairs. You are to do this whether your wife appreciates you or not, whether she is a believer or not. Though she may not be available for you when you want her to be, due to the sin in her life, if you don’t give yourself entirely to her and the family, it will affect your standing before the Lord.   **\n6.1.2. BE SECURE IN YOUR POSITION    **\nYou are the head of the woman, as Christ is your head. Do you think Christ doubts His position?     **\nJohn 13 verse 3    **\n3 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God, and went to God.   **\nJesus knew who He was and was secure enough to wash His disciples’ feet. He did not see the action as reducing Him in their sight. Instead, it was a glorious action worthy of their praise. The man is the head as ordained by God. No one can take this away, and no one can change it. Even if your wife provokes you verbally or by her actions, do not go carnally to prove that you are the head. You are the head; be secure and confident in that.    ** \n 6.1.3. KNOW WHERE YOU ARE GOING    **\nJesus knew where He was going and communicated that to the church. He set a direction before the church, which was heaven. He promised them eternal life if they would serve Him to the end. Be visionary. Lead by knowing where you are going and expecting your wife and family to follow without missing steps. Ask God to help you.    **\nProverbs 29 verse 14    **\n14 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.    **\nWhat vision do you have for yourself, your wife, and your family? What vision do you have for the future that can give your family hope? Do you have one? Do you communicate the vision? Christ preached the gospel and promised eternal life.    **\nFirst John 2 verse 25    **\n25And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal life.   **\nThe promises, hope and confidence of eternal life inspire us to follow Christ, seek Him more, and abide in Him. What reasons do you give your wife and family to follow you, to obey you like the Word of God demands? Set heaven before them. Promise them your commitment to their good.    **\n6.1.4. LEAD BY EXAMPLE   **\nJohn 13 verse 15 to 17    **\n15For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.\n16 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. \n17 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.   **\n Jesus led by example. He demonstrated servant leadership to His disciples by washing their feet. Are you the man that says, “Do what I say, not what I do?” If you want her to respect you, show her respect. If you want your children to respect you, respect them. If you do not want them to be rude to you or one another, do not be rude to them. It is as simple as that!    **\n6.1.5. LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY, TILL THE END    **\nAre you one of those who only love when times are good? When life is good, you love your wife; when life is terrible, you do not. Jesus loved unconditionally till the end.    **\nJohn 13 verse 1 to 2    **\nNow before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end.    **\nJesus had been betrayed and was about to be crucified. Yet, He loved to the end. That includes Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Him. When your wife does something wrong or makes a mistake, do you still love her? Verbalizing your anger by saying, “I hate you, I do not love you anymore, or I should never have married you,” is not a reflection of love. Christ loved till the end! You must do the same.    **\n6.2. WHAT IS THE LORD’S COMMAND TO SERVANTS?    **\n Colossians 3 verse 18 to 25    **\n18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord. 19 Husbands, love your wives and be not bitter against them. \n20 Children, obey your parents in all things for this is well-pleasing unto the Lord. \n21 Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. 22Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye service, as men-pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God; \n23And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men; \n24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for ye serve the Lord Christ. \n25But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done, and there is no respect of persons.     **\nHusband, love your wife even though your wife is a sinner. Do not be bitter towards her. You must work on your heart concerning this.    **\n 6.3. THE WIFE AS A SERVANT TO HER HUSBAND    **\nSarah called her husband lord. You are a daughter of Sarah, with all humility if you act like her. How do you rate yourself now? Servants, obey in all things, your master according to the flesh. You do not have to discriminate. Your master may not yet know Christ. You must obey God’s command to obey your master as a servant. Your husband may not be in Christ, but he is your husband; he is your master (Sarah called Abraham master). Obey as God commands. It is the right thing to do. And God will be glorified.    **\n6.3.1. LIVE WITH HIM, NOT WITH EYESERVICE.    **\nLet God also know you love your husband. A story was told of a wicked man who died in a community, and a man in that community would not speak evil of any man; he would speak only good. But all the people in the community knew that this man who passed away was wicked. When the good man came to the bereaved home, he was challenged to speak about the dead man. “You who speak ill of no man, what do you say about this man?” He came and examined the dead man; his mouth was open. The man then said, “This man has nice teeth.”    **\nThere are many things good that your husband has done and does to you. Tell people those good things about him. Thank God for those good things in him.   **\n6.3.2. LOVE WITH SINGLENESS OF HEART    **\nAs a wife, there must be something you can love, no matter how wicked your husband is. Fix your eyes on that which is good, and comfort yourself. Pray that God gives you the heart to love for your husband. Overcome his ills, hate and evils with love, which covers a multitude of sins. You can achieve this by prayer and practice.    **\nFirst Peter 4 verse 8    **\n8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves, for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.    **\nYour husband may spend nights outside. Yes, this is not right, but if he feeds and clothes you, fix your eyes on the good he does in supplying food and clothes. His wickedness is not a hundred per cent, by the way! Love with singleness of heart.   **\n6.3.3. DO UNTO HIM AS UNTO THE LORD    **\n Do whatever you must do for your husband as unto the Lord. Though he may not deserve it, God deserves it. Do it to him, for God’s sake. Let God know you are righteous, and He will reward you.  **\nI know of a woman, a government worker, whose husband abandoned her. He deserted the marriage to marry another woman, leaving the woman and their children for about twelve years. Then the husband encountered Jesus, repented, sent away the second woman and returned to his wife. He knelt before his wife and pleaded for forgiveness. Thank God the husband returned after twelve years and found the wife still faithful to God and him.     **\n 6.3.4. KNOW THAT GOD WILL REWARD YOU.    ** \n God will reward, restore, and redeem you when you do good.    **\nFirst Corinthians 10 verse 13    **\n 13There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man, but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.   **\nAs hard as the unbeliever may be, though a child of Satan, God will make you overcome in that house. Why? You are with God, and His promises must be fulfilled in your life. He knows how to part the waters of the Red Sea for you to cross. But give Him righteousness, truth, holiness, commitment, servitude and love, and you will see what He will do. Your case will be different. You will be inside the fire but will feel relaxed. The Son of God will be with you in the fire. You will be in the lions' den, but the Lord will seal their mouths against you to His praise and glory and your promotion in the sight of men.    **\n 6.4. THE UNGODLY MARRIAGE PARTNER    **\n Do unto your husband, the sinner, as God says you should do unto him. Do unto your wife, the sinner, as God says you should do unto her. You will see God with you and make it to heaven when you do.    **\nActs 4 verse 18 to 20    **\n18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. \n19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. \n20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.    **\nHere is a wife before an authoritative lion-like unbeliever, a husband whose voice releases the fear of Satan. “I told you not to go to that church anymore. If you do, I will deal with you. Any time I see you go there, you will see what I will do!” Forget that voice and speak the way Peter and John did. “God created me and brought me to you. If you do not want me, I go to Him. Your wickedness will not send me to hell. I will attend church in this house because I serve God, who created me. You are not my creator!”   **\nDo not fear, and God will take care of your relationship. You are not a slave to your husband. You do not have to walk naked in the street because your husband says so. You do not have to put on pants because your husband says so. You will go to hell! You will stand before God and tell Him who is greater  your husband or Him? Who has charge of your eternal life? Your husband married you in the flesh; he did not marry your soul.   **\nEzekiel 18 verse 4   **\n4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine, the soul that sinneth, it shall die.  **\n Should you sin and disobey God because of your husband? Then you have lost heaven. You, too, have become an unbeliever! You disqualify yourself from heaven by disobeying God in making your husband your god. Christian wives must not mind their husband’s threats lest he becomes an idol to them to provoke God into jealousy, anger and judgement. \nThe three Hebrew children said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “Oh king, we will not speak carefully or honorably to you in this matter. If you say you are throwing us into the fire, our God shall deliver us. We are ready to die if He does not, but we shall not worship your image.” Woman, tell your husband that.    **\nIf your husband wants you to perform sinful sexual acts like anal sex, tell your husband the purpose of your anus. Tell him that it is an exit port only to pass out excrement, and he is not permitted to insert his manhood in it. That is not what God sent you to his home for. If you are not ready, I will close myself; that is all there is to it. He may say, “I will leave you for someone else.” “Go to others who are willing to perish with you. But not me.” Speak boldly as the child of God that you are. The righteous are bold like the lion.    **\nAnd you man, do not be a slave to a woman. “My wife said before she gives herself to me, I must not go to church. My wife said before this and that.” Have you not learned from Adam, who ate the fruit from his wife, and both became naked? Are you listening to an unbelieving woman, obeying her commands? She decides when you should read the bible and when not to; when to go to church and when not to; when to serve God and when not to; when to travel for a conference and when not to. You have left the way! That is what it means. Answer her boldly; answer your unbelieving spouse boldly. You are the head, not her. You are the one in control, not her. You will not respect her in such matters.    **\n 6.5. LEARN FROM ABIGAIL, THE WIFE OF NABAL     **\nFirst  Samuel 25 verse 14 to 23, 32 to 35, 37 to 38     **\n14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them. 15 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields; \n16They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 17Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him. \n18 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses. 19 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband, Nabal. \n20 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them. 21 Now David had said, surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for good. \n22 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. \n23And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, … \n32 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me; 33 And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand. \n34 For in very deed, as the Lord God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. \n35 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person… \n37 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. 38 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the Lord smote Nabal, that he died.    **\nWhat was the story? In the wilderness, David protected the sheep of Nabal; he instructed his men not to touch Nabal's sheep. Generally, in the wilderness, people raid sheepfolds. But because of David and his men around them, thieves were afraid to raid Nabal's sheep. A time came when Nabal celebrated at the end of the year, giving presents and thanks to people he loved. He called all his shepherds to eat and rejoice. David sent men to Nabal to ask for something to eat too.   **\nNabal refused and spoke evil of David. When David heard about it, he was furious and decided to destroy Nabal and all he had. David’s decision reached Abigail. She did not know that David had made any demands from her husband to help them in the wilderness. What did she do? Did she wait for permission? Did she go to the husband to say I want to appease David? It would have been nonsense to the Nabal. He would not have listened, let alone responded kindly to that. It would have been a problem, yet doing this was required for righteousness and peace. Abigail did what was right to save herself, her husband and her household.   **\nThis is a lesson for women who may be in similar situations. You must not tell your husband everything, especially when you know he is a wicked, foolish, and ungodly man. Why must you tell your husband before you give your tithes or before you support the cause of Christ? Does it mean you cannot practice righteousness unless your husband permits? Abigail practised righteousness, and that righteousness saved her life and household. When she came later to explain what happened to lead her husband to repentance, it tended instead to his death, the reward of his wickedness. \nWhat does the bible say about not doing what you know you must do? To refuse to do good or save a life when you can be a sin.   **\nJames 4 verse 17   **\n 17Therefore, to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.  **\n Do not hide behind your husband and become unproductive. Because your man will not serve God, fear God, nor be charitable to Him, is no excuse for you to do the same. You must use wisdom to serve God in righteousness. Abigail was a righteous woman who obeyed her husband despite his wickedness. \nWhen the Lord leads you to practice righteousness, and you know that you are not doing it out of pride, and you are not wasting the family resources, go ahead and do it and give glory to God. When you do, you will save yourself, your children and all those in your household. It is not sin to do good directed by God.    **\n6.6. LEARN FROM OBADIAH    **\n First Kings 18 verse 1 to 13   **\n1 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth. 2 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria. 3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly; 4 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) \n5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks, peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. \n6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it, Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. \n7And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah? 8 And he answered him, I am; go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here. \n9And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? 10As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee; and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not. 11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.\n 12 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the Lord shall carry thee whither I know not; and so, when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me, but I thy servant fear the Lord from my youth. \n13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the Lord, how I hid a hundred men of the Lord's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?    **\nObadiah was a righteous man, serving in the government of Ahab and Jezebel. As a wife is a servant to her husband, so was Obadiah to his master Ahab. But Ahab was wicked. He began killing the Lord’s prophets. Did Obadiah take permission from him to hide some prophets? He, too, might have been killed had he dared to. He hid one hundred prophets and fed them with food and water daily.   **\nWhere was he getting the food from? It could have been from the government because he was under the government of Ahab. It could have been from his resources. But he was doing this under the government of Ahab, an unrighteous, polluted and ungodly government. Nonetheless, Obadiah practiced holiness, righteousness, and charity.   **\nYou can serve in an ungodly environment and still be godly. Even when the conditions are contrary, you can do right.    **\n6.7. WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR PARTNER IS UNGODLY    **\n 6.7.1. ASK FOR HELP   **\n If you are married to an ungodly partner, that should not stop you from being a blessing to people, the church, and your community. Being married to an ungodly partner should not make you barren regarding good works. If you have a spouse who will not allow you, please, ask God for help, and He will give you favor, wisdom and counsel.    **\nYour righteousness will always make you overcome. Even when it is risky, the power of righteousness in you shall overcome; you will serve the Lord successfully in wisdom and boldness even with an ungodly spouse.    **\n6.7.2. ASK FOR GRACE   **\nWho is that person who has married an unbeliever and succeeded? It is not by might or power, only by God. Ask for grace from God to help you if you have an unbelieving spouse.    **\nSecond  Corinthians 12 verse 8, 9   **\n 8For this thing, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. \n9And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.    **\nMany wish their spouses were gone or dead  “I am waiting for you to die; I will marry another woman.” The woman also says, “I want you to die so I can marry another man.” Wishing someone dead is evil, so do not do it. Do not wish evil on someone. \nWhat should you do? His grace is sufficient for you. The grace of the Lord is what you need. If you have an unbelieving spouse, ask for grace.    **\nHebrews 4 verse 15 to 16    **\n15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. \n16 Let us, therefore, come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.    **\nGo to God and ask for grace if your spouse is an unbeliever so that you will not go to hell. If your strength is failing, the grace of God is the only solution. Pray and ask God for help. His grace is sufficient.    **\n6.7.3. LIVE A PRAYERFUL LIFE    **\nYou must live a prayerful life. Take prayer as the person with diabetes takes drugs to survive. Take prayer as the hypertensive take drugs to control their blood pressure. Pray day and night to be able to overcome those demons, to subdue them, to be able to get angels to come and help you in that hostile environment.   **\n6.7.4. ASK FOR WISDOM    **\nAsk for wisdom from God to enable you to live with an unbelieving marriage partner. The Bible tells us the vital parts of wisdom.    **\nSecond Chronicles 1 verse 10    **\n10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?   **\n Give me wisdom that I may know how to go out and come in with this woman or man. How can you live with such an evil person, except by wisdom? Ask for wisdom.    **\n Proverbs 4 verse 5 to 13    **\n5 Get wisdom, get understanding  forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. 6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee; love her, and she shall keep thee. \n7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore, get wisdom, and with all thy getting get understanding. 8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee, she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. \n9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace; a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. 10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. \n11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. 12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straightened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. \n13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go keep her; for she is thy life.    **\nGet wisdom; ask for it. Solomon prayed for administrative wisdom to help him know how to lead people. You, too, need the wisdom to live with your spouse. The God of heaven will help you; God will give you grace and wisdom.  **\n\n\n\nPART III  **\nOBEDIENCE AND WISDOM FOR HOLINESS IN MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY LIFE  **\n\nCHAPTER 7    **\nGOD DEMANDS OBEDIENCE TO HIS WORD    **\nThe scripture below tells us that God expects perfection in the lives of His children. Do all things well, do not allow defilement into your life, your walk With God, and your speech. Do not allow lies or abusive or corrupt words to come out of your mouth. Walk in the way of God. Walk in the Word of God. You will be blessed when you keep the testimonies of God, when you keep the commandments of God and when you become a testimony to others to promote the name of the Lord.    **\nPsalms 119 verse 1 to  6    **\n1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord. \n2Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart. \n3They also do no iniquity, they walk in his ways. 4Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. \n5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! \n6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.   **\nGod wants you to seek Him with your whole heart. Do not give in to temptation. Be perfect in your marital relationship, even if you are married to an unbeliever. Even if you are married to a carnal Christian, be perfect so there may be no fault in you. Put iniquity far away from you. Do not tell lies or be abusive. Let your words be righteous. Walk in the ways of God. Keep anger and malice far away from you.   **\nAsk for God's help in prayer to reflect Christ before your spouse. Also, pray that you will obey God's Word and not be ashamed before those you profess your faith.\nObey the word, the commandments of God concerning marriage. Wisdom is needed when things do not flow freely because of contrary circumstances.   **\nYou may face obstacles which may compel you to want to compromise your holiness and righteousness in your marriage. Apply wisdom from God to enable you to leap over or manoeuvre around these obstacles. Obedience and wisdom will make you live the holy and righteous life in your marriage that God expects from you. He expects you to be perfect and holy in marriage and family life.   **\n 7.1. WHO WAS APOSTLE PAUL WRITING TO?    **\nEphesians 5 verse 2 to 27    **\n22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 23For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church, and he is the saviour of the body. \n24 Therefore as the Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. 25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it; \n26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.    **\nWho was Paul writing to in this book? He tells us in   **\n Ephesians 1 verse 1 to 2      **\n1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus; 2 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.    **\nThis epistle was written to the saints (both male and female) and the faithful believers in Christ Jesus. Paul was giving them an instruction. If you are a believer, this is what God expects of you as a married woman or man  faithfulness.   **\n Paul is not writing to ordinary saints but to faithful saints who have accepted to follow God's Word diligently. He said, “Brother, I expect this in your home, in your family. Sister, by your confession and testimony that you are a Christian, I expect this in your marriage and home.”    **\n7.2. INSTRUCTIONS TO WIVES    **\n7.2.1. WIVES, SUBMIT TO YOUR HUSBANDS.    **\nEphesians 5 verse 22    **\n22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.    **\nWives, submit yourselves to your own husbands. Some wives respect people and treat other men with honor and humility. The Bible says to do the same to your husband. Why do you love people outside more than your husband? Why are you obeying people outside more than your husband? Why do you submit to leadership  your boss, even your pastor, more than you do to your husband? Why do you deal cheerfully, lovingly, with neighbors more than your husband? Make sure you submit to him, too and much more.   **\n 7.2.2. DO NOT DELAY IN OBEDIENCE TO YOUR HUSBAND    **\nThe scripture further says you should submit to your husband as unto the Lord as if your husband were the Lord Jesus Christ Himself. How would you have treated Jesus if you saw Him physically? You would have been excited; you would laugh and want to kneel before Him, thank Him, bless Him, obey every word He speaks, and make promises and commitments. Therefore, do so to your husband. Holy wives should not break the commandments of their husbands just as they will not break those of Jesus Christ.    **\nPsalms 119 verse 59 to 61     **\n59 I thought on my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. 60 I made haste and delayed not to keep thy commandments.    **\nPlease do not delay in all matters about your husband  to obey and submit to him.    **\n7.2.3. LET YOUR HUSBAND BE YOUR HEAD    **\n Ephesians 5 verse 23    **\n 23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church,  and he is the savior of the body.    **\nLet your husband be your head. Allow him. God gave it to him because he is a man. Headship is not given to you because you are a woman. There is no other qualification. It is not because he is born-again, educated, or intelligent. But because he is a man, he is automatically the head of the marriage and family. God divinely decided that. Letting your husband be your head means you should allow him to lead, command, reproof you and be the final authority in all decisions in your marriage. Apostle Paul writes to the faithful saints in Christ Jesus, giving them these rules. If you are a married Christian woman, this also applies to you. God wants you to be perfect. Please do not allow the desire of the flesh to make you disobey God’s instruction. This will reflect unrighteousness, uncleanness, and ungodliness. If you allow money, the comfort of yourself, and the pride of life to affect this, you are not faithful in Christ Jesus.    **\nIf money, the flesh, and the love of the world are why you are unfaithful in your calling as a wife, you are not faithful in Christ Jesus. Obey your husband in all things and all legitimate ways.     **\n 7.2.4. SEE YOUR HUSBAND AS THE CHURCH SEES CHRIST IN SUBMISSION, OBEDIENCE, AND LOVE   **\nThe husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church. Nobody will compete with Christ in authority. None will ever lift their head as though they are Christ in the Church. None will ever take the position of Christ.   ** \nFirst Peter 5 verse 1 to 3    **\n1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed;\n 2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;\n 3 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being examples to the flock.   **\nAs ministers of the gospel, we give Christ His place. He dictates our ways. We seek primarily to please Jesus. Our mind is on Jesus. We sing His praise and appreciate Him. If He says go, we go, and if He says we stay back, we stay back. Woman, let your husband lead. Do not speak ill of your husband to your children. Always speak well of your husband, their father, to them. Love covers a multitude of sins.    **\n Do not succumb to temptation because your life is more than marriage. Humble yourself in the marriage so that marriage will not affect your soul and stop you from going to heaven. Be careful with your marriage; otherwise, you shall be disqualified from entering heaven.    **\nMark 8 verse 36    **\n36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?    **\nWhat shall it profit a woman if she gains her convenience, is great in the marriage, thinks the way she wants, is feared by the man and the children, and takes the seat of lordship but eventually goes to hell?    **\nWhat is the benefit? See your husband as the Church sees Christ in submission and obedience. Respect, submit to, honor, and do not speak back at him. Please do not be rude to him.\n Remember, the Bible addresses you as a saint, as faithful in Christ Jesus. So, the Bible does not expect sin in your life or marriage.   **\n7.2.5. SEE YOUR HUSBAND AS A SAVIOUR, SUSTAINER, AND       PROVIDER OF THE FAMILY    ** \nSee what the scripture says in verses 23 and 24. Do we not call on the name of the Lord every time we are in need? See your husband in the same light. Do not live a life of independence. See your husband as the Church sees Christ. Christ is the savior of the body. Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Do not belittle your husband by not seeking his counsel or instruction. It is unrighteous not to listen to his contributions but do whatever you desire.   **\nWhen you despise your husband, it is proof you do not submit to him. When you submit to your husband and ask for help when you need it, even financial assistance, he will willingly give you. Be happy you trust and honor him and expect him to do his role as your husband, even if he does not have to give.   **\nYour husband is the provider. All you do should be under his instruction. Let your conduct prove that you recognize him as the head of the house. For example, would you not tell your boss your whereabouts as a worker? Would you not take permission from your boss to be absent from work if a need arose? Would you not report to him when you are sick? Your husband is the boss of your home. Why do you do things without his permission? Why do you go out as you want, come in as you want, stay out as you wish, and say I have no account to give to anybody? That is ungodly. If you live that way, you are not faithful in Christ Jesus; you are not the saint this scripture is written to.    **\nSubmit in all things. A man was dying. He called his only son and said, \"I have achieved all these things in life  buildings, businesses, cars, a manager, and many servants. But you are only going to take one thing. The rest will not be yours. What will you take?\" Knowing that the manager is conversant with all the father has and that the father owns even the manager, he said, \"I take your manager.\" That is a wise man. If the manager is the one who manages all the resources, and the manager is under me, he will oversee the resources for me as if it were for you.” This is wisdom!    **\nYou own much personal wealth, financial and material resources, but the Lord has put you under a man. Therefore, all your wealth belongs to him, your husband.   **\n 7.3. INSTRUCTIONS TO HUSBANDS    **\nRemember, this instruction is to the saints, who are faithful in Christ Jesus. The apostle is speaking, knowing you are a saint, not just a saint by name, but one faithful in Christ Jesus. The apostle considers you to be born-again, a man preserving his faith and does not want to be ashamed before his wife, lest she says, \"I thought I married a Christian.\" The Lord expects you to be a man who strives to preserve his faith before his children, lest they say, \"I thought our father was a true minister of the gospel.\" He wants you not to be ashamed before your neighbor if they hear you screaming, shouting, and barking like a dog at night. Minister, your house should be as the scripture says; your marriage should be as the scripture says. The verses that carry the instruction for men who are faithful in Christ are     **\nEphesians 5 verse 25 to 27   **\n25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it; \n26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, \n27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. \n7.3.1. LOVE YOUR WIFE    **\nOpen your heart to your wife. Learn to smile and laugh joyfully with your wife. Learn to be joyful in her presence. Cherish your wife. Always enjoy the companionship of your wife.    **\nIt goes beyond that – Love your wife as Christ also loves the Church. Do not love in the realm of the natural man. Go to the realm of Christ. Christ loved the Church. How did He love the Church?    **\nFirst Corinthians 13 verse 4 to 6     **\n4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, \n5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; \n6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;    **\n\n7.3.2. BE PATIENT WITH YOUR WIFE     **\nCharity here means love. Love is patient. Be patient with your wife. Do not be quickly provoked. Do not speak harshly to her. Why do you want to make your wife know that you are a pretender? If you say harsh words or abusive words at her every mistake, it shows your profession of Christianity has all been fake. When you smile at her later, she will call it the smile of a hypocrite. Learn to be patient with your wife.    **\n7.3.3. BE KIND TO YOUR WIFE     **\nLove is kind. Be kind. Give good gifts to your wife. Speak kindly to her. Be soft and tender. Even when she does wrong, please, respond softly and gently to turn away evil.    **\n7.3.4. DO NOT ENVY OR COMPETE WITH YOUR WIFE    **\nCharity does not envy. Do not envy the position of your wife in case God blesses her more financially. The money is coming to the entire family. All windows in a room are open to let in air. So, she is a window by which air comes into the house. It should be a blessing. If your wife is in a better position or qualification that will bless the family, that means more income and honor for the family. Why should you be envious? If your wife has a talent that is a blessing to the home, why do you envy her? Love your wife, do not envy her.    **\n7.3.5. DO NOT BOAST OR BE PROUD TO YOUR WIFE    **\nThe above verse continues, saying that charity does not vaunt itself, is not proud and not boastful. Why do you say, \"I have to show this woman I am greater than her; I am this or that?\" Did Jesus show us that we are nothing? Do we not know that He is all things? Why should your wife be under bondage because of you? You say I am great; I am the man; I am the head. So what? Should your wife see you as a terrorist in the house? Should that subject her to bondage? Should that make her a second class in your home?    **\nDo not be boastful. Do not boast of your talents. Does the Lord boast to the Church? Instead, He says, \"What I have is yours, all my Father has is yours, all I have acquired is yours. There are yet more riches you have not seen. There are yet more riches waiting for you.\" So, make your wife understand that all you shall have in life is hers.    **\n7.3.6. DO NOT BE CARELESS AND FOOLISH    **\nCharity does not behave unseemly. Why do you misbehave as a fool? Why did you pour water on your wife because she made a mistake? Why did you beat your wife or throw her to the ground? That is foolishness. You lose your respect by doing that. Your behavior shows how irreverent you are. She thought you to be a man of wisdom but is seeing folly in you. A little folly in a man esteemed to be a man of wisdom turns him into a fool. So, do not behave foolishly.    **\n7.3.7. DO NOT BE SELFISH TO YOUR WIFE     **\nLove seeks not its own. You went out, bought some roasted meat, and sat in the living room, eating it alone. You did not give your wife or children. If what you eat is good, it is also good for your wife. Do that which gives joy and satisfaction to your wife as Christ would do for the Church.    **\nThere are some things natural people cannot do because of the law of sin, the power of sin in the world, and the nature of sin in them. They cannot overcome it. But you can overcome because you are an overcomer through Christ Jesus and are faithful in Christ Jesus. Do more than your neighbors are doing. Do more than your biological brothers are doing. Go beyond what your father, who was not born again, did. Your father was not a faithful saint, so do not copy what your father did; go beyond that.    **\n7.3.8. DO NOT BE QUICK TO ANGER AT YOUR WIFE    **\nLove is not easily provoked. Anger destroys a marriage. A man that is in bondage to anger should not be a pastor. A bishop must not be quick to get angry. The Bible says, make no friendship with an angry man.    **\nProverbs 22 verse 24    **\n24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go    **\nWoe is the life of she who has married an angry man. Her life will be tough. Her laughter and smile will be hypocritical  done only to please the angry man. She will always cover herself to hide the pain, fear, and sorrow.   **\nDo you know the type of fear anger communicates? Do you see the chain an angry man holds? Can you perceive the degree of fear a chained, mad dog can still communicate? Even though you know the dog is chained, you still pass by it with great fear. You may decide not to go by the chained dog's but go through another way or retreat altogether. This is how an angry man has made his family live with him. We must note that women can also be angry.    **\nThe Word says if you are an angry man, you are not fit to have a wife. It would be best to be alone because you would disturb and inconvenience your wife. You will not permit her to make mistakes as everyone does; you will not accept a simple error like adding too much salt to food. Put that anger away from your life. Take it to God in prayer. Cry against it.     **\nLove is not easily provoked. When your wife does or says something wrong, make room for learning. No one is perfect. Your home will be fantastic when you make room for people to learn from their mistakes instead of quickly getting provoked each time.    **\nNaturally, when your wife makes a mistake, she will be troubled, wondering, \"What will I tell this man? I do not know what happened. The wind came in and blew this down. But if I tell him, he will not agree and say I did it.\" Now imagine when you come home, and she tells you what happened, and you simply say, \"It is okay,\" and even check if she is okay, she will rejoice in her heart, giving God thanks for a wonderful husband. So do not be so quick to be provoked into anger.   **\n7.3.9. DO NOT BE EVIL TO YOUR WIFE    **\nLove thinketh not evil. Work it out in your heart. Actions come from thoughts. As a man thinketh, so, is he? Evil starts with a thought. The thought produces the force of action. Therefore, remove the evil thoughts from your mind if you do not want to act ungodly. Reject those evil thoughts you have towards your wife immediately after they come. Keep sweeping your mind, so those evil thoughts will not settle against her. If your wife has a blemish or infirmity in her physical body, set not your mind on it. Love does not rejoice in iniquity. Do not rejoice when your wife is sick, saying, \"You think you can do everything. Now you are helpless and sick; good for you!\" When such thoughts invade your mind, kick them out. Do not allow your wife to notice that you delight in her fall. Do not let her see you amused or glad by a mishap in her family. That is the heart of a devil. Love your wife as Christ also loves the Church.    **\n7.3.10. BEAR WITH YOUR WIFE AND BELIEVE HER     **\nLearn to bear all things. Learn to believe what your wife says. Be hopeful to see her grow and improve in many things. Endure all things. Endure even though she may be rebellious. This is love. And you are to love your wife as Christ loved the Church and gave Himself for it.     **\nEphesians 5 verse 25 to 27    **\n25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it; \n26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, 27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.   **\n7.3.11. GIVE YOURSELF TO YOUR WIFE AS CHRIST GAVE HIMSELF TO THE CHURCH    **\nGive yourself to the care of your wife as Christ gave Himself to the care of the Church. Give yourself; do not be nonchalant. Make time for your wife as Christ also spent on the Church; it cost Him. He gave Himself for the world to make them part of the Church when they believe in Him. When He gave Himself for the Church that has now become His bride, it was so that He might sanctify and cleanse it by the washing of water by the Word.    **\nHusbands, love yourself by giving yourself to perfect her. Learn to teach your wife essential knowledge. Teach your wife to make her what you want. You may invite a professional to teach her how to cook. If your wife does not speak good English or your language, you can employ someone to teach her at home to improve her literacy. You can send her to school to improve her. Such actions improve and increase her worthiness to your joy and satisfaction.    **\nCleanse her with the right words as Christ cleanses the Church. This water is the Word of God. Use the Word of God on your wife.   **\n 2 Timothy 3 verse 15 to 17    **\n15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;\n17 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.    **\nLearn to use the scriptures on your wife. Reproof her with scriptures in the areas of her fault. Open her eyes to the scriptures to let her know she is wrong. Correct her with the Word of God. Let her know what the Bible says about her actions. According to the scriptures, instruct her in all matters of righteousness to make her a perfect person. Use words to perfect your wife. Speak  do not be quiet. Why are you silent about her many mistakes? Explain to her what wrong she is doing, backed by scriptures.     **\nThis also applies to a Christian, born-again woman, a saint, and faithful in Christ Jesus. To such, the Bible says, give counsel to a wise man, and he will be wiser.   **\n Proverbs 1 verse 5    **\n5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels    **\nThis is not for a woman in the flesh, a carnal woman, or a woman who is a sinner. Reproof not a fool lest he hates you. A woman that does not love the Lord Jesus and is not ready to submit to God’s Word will despise correction.     **\nProverbs 9 verse 8    **\n8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee; rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.     **\nA woman looking for perfection for heaven will not want to live in sin as an unbeliever in the marriage. Are you not looking for perfection? Do you want to miss heaven?    **\nThe Lord has told your husband to do as Christ has done to the Church by using the scripture of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding to perfect you by giving you scriptural reproof, correction, and instruction. But you say, “I do not need your correction; I do not need your instruction; stop shouting at me.” How, then, can you be perfect?    **\nThe man is doing this to present you to himself, the woman of his vision, as Christ did to the Church, to present her to Himself holy and without blemish. This man is training you to live in a way that would make him happy with you, how he can play with you joyfully, how he will reward you joyfully, and how he will boast of you as his wife before others. You say no?     **\nKing Ahasuerus wanted Vashti to come before the people, to make them know how much he had invested in her for his glory. If a man wants to boast about his wife to others, he must perfect her according to scriptural truth. Your husband is doing everything to perfect you, boast of you, and give testimony about you. Why, then, are you resisting instruction, reproof and correction?    **\n As a wise man knows that he does not know enough, become a wise woman and understand that you have not learned enough to receive more. Your husband is instructing you just as Christ is teaching the Church. How? By the washing of water to cleanse her by the Word, to present her to Himself, a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy, and without blemish.     **\nThis means that you are not perfect. Though married for many years, you are not yet perfect. You need to know the man more; you need to know his likes and dislikes. And these you cannot know in one day. Even if you read them from a book, you will forget and need to be reminded repeatedly. Therefore, be humble to receive instructions.     **\nJesus said if I do not wash your feet, you do not belong to me. Permit your husband to do what he is responsible for doing to present you to himself, the wife he loves to live with. Do not frustrate him. Instead of living with him with dust on your feet, permit him to wash your feet. Do not sleep next to him with dust on your feet. Do not behave like Peter, who refused that his feet be washed.    **\n“If I do not wash you, if I do not correct you, if I do not reproof you, you will not be the man of my vision; you have nothing to do with my life,” a paraphrase of Jesus' words to Peter.    **\nThese are the instructions God gives man (husband)  to obey, to present a glorious woman to himself.    **\n\nCHAPTER 8   **\nREASONS FOR DISOBEDIENCE TO GOD IN MARRIAGE   **\nObedience is required for Christian wives and husbands to keep their marriage and family righteous. Do you think it is difficult for a husband to miss heaven because of his wife? Do you think it is difficult for a wife to miss heaven because of her husband? Is your marriage a marketplace where Satan comes to market his goods? With his power, he can keep the couple grudging each other all week, yet come Sunday morning, they go to church. Is that what Satan is doing in your home? Then you are not saints; you are not faithful in Christ Jesus. You are not on your way to heaven, and your marriage is miserable. It is better you were never married than married, and you are going to hell.    **\nThe Lord is looking for perfection. When Adam said, “The woman you gave me served the fruit as food for me to eat,” did God keep him in the Garden? That excuse was true, but it did not stop God from banishing Adam from the Garden. Make no excuses because of your wife. It will not give you heaven. When the woman said, “it was the serpent that gave me to eat,” did it excuse her from the judgment? Your excuses, however genuine, will not exclude you from hell. They will take you to hell. So, please make up your mind to make it to heaven since you are already in the marriage. Sit down, count the cost, and stand for it so you can make heaven. You do not need to be comforted in your sin. God will not pity a sinner or backslider and give him heaven.    **\n8.1. REASONS FOR DISOBEDIENCE TO GOD   **\n8.1.1. SIN AND CARNALITY IN ONE OF THE PARTNERS     **\n Ephesians 1 verse 1, 2     **\n1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus; 2 Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.    **\nThere are people this Epistle is not written to. Who are the people? Those who are not saints, those who are not faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace is given to those who already are in Christ Jesus. Grace is not given to those who are not in Christ to help  them practice the Word of God until they become born again. You fan the flames under a pot where a fire is already burning to increase its intensity, but what do you fan when there is no fire under the pot? Marrying outside the will of God is the beginning of sorrow because your spouse will not be able to receive nor keep God’s divine instructions on marriage. It will be like driving a car with deflated tyres. You will have to struggle to move the vehicle. The Lord commands His children not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers.    **\n second Corinthians 6 verse 14    **\n14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers, for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness?    **\nWhat about Christians who marry some who claim to be born again but are not? Using the fire and pot analogy, they have no fire under their pot and, therefore, no grace for a successful marriage. Child of God, if you are thinking of heaven and want to make heaven, make sure you marry a faithful Christian. Ask God for help. Do not allow anything or anyone to rush you into marriage.    **\nWhat about those who are already married and married in Christ? It’s a good thing. But if one backslides, it becomes terrible. Once they backslide, they lose the fear of God and possibly the love for their spouse. Their thoughts may become vengeful and wicked. They could embarrass their spouse or lead them to sin. Therefore, be careful not to cause your spouse to backslide. If you do, you will reap terrible results as a consequence.    **\nWhere one person in the marriage is an unbeliever, and you are the believer, life may be challenging, but remember God’s Word  you must be perfect and holy. The standard does not change whether you are married to an unbeliever. Satan is in the world, but some live righteously and in holiness by God’s grace. He expects that you seek His help if you have such a case. If one spouse is not fully committed to God, the other will suffer many things. ‘Not committed’ means the flesh has come in, and carnality has taken over, even though the home is considered a Christian home. There will be problems because the carnal partner cannot flow in righteousness.    **\nBe careful not to make your partner backslide. Your punishment will be too great for you, as Cain said. Likewise, the reward will be too great above whatever you enjoy in your backslidden state. Promote righteousness in the marriage. Encourage your spouse to remain righteous for your good. Spend time praying for your spouse to remain faithful in Christ Jesus.    **\n 8.1.2. LACK OF PRAYER    **\nLack of prayer means a lack of fuel for your spiritual engine to drive your Christian life. Jesus' instruction as part of the Lord’s Prayer says, “When ye pray, say, give us this day our daily bread.” Among many benefits, prayer empowers us to live above sin successfully. But when we stop praying, we become vulnerable to the devil and our former sinful habits. Our boasting over sin and Satan will cease as prayer ceases.     **\n John 14 verse 30    **\n30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you,  for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.     **\nSatan will surely come and will never stop coming. Grace received through prayer keeps Satan from seeing fault in you. You will lose your ability to resist the temptation Satan will bring through your spouse if you are no longer prayerful. The carnal mind does not understand the things of God because they are spiritually discerned. Prayers will give you the grace to understand and overcome the temptations of Satan through your spouse.     ** \nFirst Corinthians 2 verse 14    **\n14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.   **\nWhen you misinterpret things because your spirituality is down, every little word spoken by your partner will anger you. This is because your prayer life is no longer vibrant. Watch and pray that you do not fall into temptation.    **\nMatthew 26 verse 41    **\n41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation, the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.    **\n Because you do not pray anymore, lust will show up. Other women will become more attractive than your wife. You will desire them. Lustful thoughts that were never there will take over your mind. The maid that has worked for your household for a long time without you thinking or desiring her will suddenly become attractive. You will no longer have the grace to overcome those thoughts because your prayer life is down.    **\nPrayerlessness can also make the wife quick-tempered and easily irritable; all kinds of sins she lived in will start shooting up. Your spouse’s weaknesses, which you had learned to overlook, may soon become an issue again. Encourage one another to pray and learn to pray together. If your prayer life is dwindling, arrest it quickly. Cry to the Lord; do not allow the devil who used to come and find nothing to accuse you of, to now come and see something in your life to hold on to, to ruin your marriage.     **\n8.1.3. FOLLOWING WRONG COUNSEL.    **\nWrong counsel is like a foreign object in one’s body. Think of a speck or mote entering your eye. If that happens, the eye will naturally blink, losing its ability to see things comfortably or clearly for a moment. Wrong counsel immediately affects righteousness in the home. You begin to behave like a blinking eye; one moment, you are righteous, the other, you are down. Take every counsel you receive to God in prayer for His confirmation or rejection.    **\n8.1.4. FOLLOWING THE WRONG COMPANY.    **\n Naturally, evil communication corrupts good manners.   ** \nFirst Corinthians 15 verse 33   **\n33 Be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners. \nFollowing or learning from the wrong company will corrupt you. Amnon was a friend of Jonadab. Jonadab gave a wicked counsel. Amnon committed incest with his sister Tamar. He was eventually killed by the bad counsel he received.   **\nsecond Samuel 13 verse 3 to 14    **\n3But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, and Jonadab was a very subtil man.\n4 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? Wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.\n5 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick, and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand. \n6 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand. \n7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat. 8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. 9 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him. 10 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon, her brother. 11 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.\n 12 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me;  for no such thing ought to be done in Israel, do not thou this folly. \n13 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now, therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee. 14 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.    **\nAvoid the company of those who can lead you into sin; be they your friends or relations. \nSo how can a Christian couple remain obedient to God and enjoy marriage? The Lord Jesus says,   **\nMatthew 5 verse 48    **\n48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.   **\nTherefore, the couple should aim for perfection. Their commitment should be first to God and His Word. In a Christian marriage, when the parties involved commit themselves to the Word of God as individuals, their marriage will succeed. Make your marriage succeed through a life of obedience, righteousness and holiness.   **\nCHAPTER  9    **\nWISDOM AND PRUDENCE TO MAINTAIN RIGHTEOUSNESS IN MARRIAGE     **\nWisdom asks the question  what should I do, given that my partner is not righteous, is not born-again, is carnal, is in the flesh, does not fear God and will not keep His commandments? How do I play my role in righteousness? Here are a few things you should do    **\n9.1. ASK GOD ALWAYS    ** \n Seek God’s face in all matters. Men ought always to pray and not faint.   **\nLuke 18 verse 1    **\n1 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray,  and not to faint;     **\nBe prayerful in your marriage to always know what to do.   **\nJames 1 verse 4 to 5   **\n 4 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. \n5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.   **\n To be perfect, entire and in want of nothing, you must be patient with the other person, no matter what they do. Control yourself and your emotions. Refuse to set your mind, eyes and heart on evil.    **\nAsk God if you lack wisdom in responding to your husband or how to treat your wife. Always ask God what to do and how to do it when dealing with an unbelieving or backslidden partner. Ask God for help. If you must correct your spouse, receive grace from God to do it correctly. Remember, God is always a ready help in times of trouble. He understands what you are going through and will not fail to help you as you go to Him in prayer    **\n 9.2. FOLLOW THE SCRIPTURES ALWAYS IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP    **\nMake sure all you do is scriptural. That is where your comfort is. It is also where your wisdom and victory are.     **\nRomans 15 verse 4    **\n4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. \nDetermine to act only according to the scriptures, for you will find comfort, strength, peace and support in the scriptures. As you obey the scriptures, whatever abuse comes, as a result will be considered persecution, and your conscience will not be guilty before God. It is better for your spouse to be offended than God; God should be at peace with you than one on earth because He is the owner of your life and the judge of all.    **\nAvoid engaging in activities that are clearly against the scriptures. Remember, for heaven's sake, you are to be perfect in your dealings with your spouse, seeing that the rapture will not give anyone time to make things right before they are taken. The rapture will happen suddenly and according to God’s time, not yours or your family's. Not when your spouse can now let you do some or all the godly things, they had stopped you from doing in the past. You must remain perfect.    **\nIf the believing spouse is eventually kicked out of their marital home, they should not be surprised; it is scriptural. The Bible says you will be persecuted and cast away from the synagogue. The rejected spouse should be comforted by being sent out from their home because of persecution, not because of their sin. God will take care of them. David expresses his dependence on God in words below    **\nPsalm 27 verse 10    **\n10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.   **\nHe knew that God would help and sustain him without any doubt if all other help failed.    **\n9.3. SEEK COUNSEL FROM THE RIGHTEOUS AND HOLY     **\nGod gives righteous preachers wisdom to counsel you for holy living. Ask for advice from the righteous and holy so that you will know precisely what the mind of God is. Solomon, the teacher, said     **\nProverbs 15 verse 22    **\n22 Without counsel, purposes are disappointed, but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.    **\nIt is necessary to seek counsel from the experienced in important matters. Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom.    **\nColossians 3 verse 16    **\n16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.    **\nAlways apply wisdom to the Word of God. Counselling will help you deal wisely with the practical situations of life. Do not be independent; learn to go for counselling since, typically, there is more insight from many people than from one person.    **\nThe wise man Solomon tells us, “Two are better than one, they have a better reward for their labor” (Eccl. 4 verse 9). Therefore, getting some godly eyes to see with you or godly brains to reason with you will definitely lead you to make the right decision that will go a long way to help your marriage.    **\n9.4. CURTAIL INFORMATION     **\nBecause your spouse is not born again, learn to control what information you share with them.   **\n Micah 7 verse 5, 6    **\n5 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide, keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. 6 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law, a man's enemies are the men of his own house.    **\nThere is truth, and there is wisdom. Truth is eternal, and wisdom greases truth so that truth can be acted upon without causing injury. It would help if you acted on the truth, but you need the wisdom to lubricate that truth to make it move peacefully and smoothly. Like Abigail (in first Samuel 25), know when it is appropriate or not to talk, to share sensitive information with your spouse. When she saw that Nabal, her husband was drunk, she waited until morning when he would be sober to talk to him. So learn to curtail and control what you say to your unbelieving or backslidden spouse.     **\n9.5. BE LOVING AND CARING     **\nBe loving and caring because it is healing. Love your enemies. You might, by love, convert your enemies.    **\nFirst Peter 3 verse 1 to 2     **\n1 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; 2 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.    **\nThis is an unbelieving husband. Your character towards him can convert him. He might not bother to appreciate your character, but you have given God something to work upon and draw him to Himself. Man, love your wife, care for her though she may be stubborn. God is your witness. He will favour you, comfort you, fight for you, justify and rapture you because He knows you are keeping His Word.    **\n 9.6. MAKE SURE GOD IS ON YOUR SIDE    **\nPsalm 118 verse 6 to 7    **\n6 The Lord is on my side; I will not fear, what can man do unto me? \n7 The Lord taketh my part with them that help me; therefore, shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.    **\nClearly, in the scripture above, the psalmist was in trouble but chose not to walk in fear or discouragement but to acknowledge the presence of God. Confidently, trust that God will handle your enemies. God is always on the side of the righteous to help them. To the psalmist above, his enemies were his opponents that he desired God to judge. But as for you whose enemy is your spouse now, you do not wish that God will do evil to your spouse. However, your desire should be that God will handle him in way whether it be judgment or any other means that will make him come back to his senses and get repented so that you can enjoy eternal life together.    **\n9.7. EXERCISE WISDOM AND PRUDENCE.    **\nPrudence is wisdom in action.   **\nProverbs 12 verse 23   **\n23 A prudent man concealeth knowledge but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.    **\nWisdom and prudence will let you know when to withhold or let out information to your unbelieving spouse. For example, you are a wife, and there’s a Christian conference you wish to attend. It so happens that your unbelieving husband, who would typically not want you to attend such a conference, is away. Wisdom demands that you quietly go to your meeting and enjoy yourself rather than tempt him to seek his approval when you already know the outcome. Likewise, a prudent man will not share information that may stir up problems with an unbelieving partner.    **\nEsther in the Bible is a clear example of one who exercised lots of prudence in her dealings with her husband, the king.    **\n Proverbs 13 verse 16    **  \n16 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge, but a fool layeth open his folly.   **\nAs a prudent person, always make sure you act with knowledge, accurate knowledge, about a matter, not suspicions. Get all your facts straight before you confront your spouse about any matter. Accusing them falsely might provoke them to rebel or become more rebellious.   **\nProverbs 14 verse 15   **\n15 The simple believeth every word, but the prudent man looketh well to his going.   **\nThe prudent man judges. He considers and examines everything to know the truth.  **\n Proverbs 18 verse 15    **\n 15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.   **\n Get more knowledge. There is safety with more information or knowledge. Commit yourself to listen to sound biblical teachings. Read more and more books. Knowledge will enable you to be more confident and help you handle matters better in your marriage and life.    **\n Proverbs 19 verse 14   ** \n14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the Lord.   **\nWives, God wants you to be prudent, to know how to always deal with your husband and in every matter.    **\n Proverbs 22 verse 3     **\n3 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself, but the simple pass on, and are punished.   **\nA prudent man thinks ahead. He considers before taking steps. He will say, “If I follow this course, this might be the result. I want to avoid that, so I will not go that way.” Meanwhile, a thoughtless person passes on and suffers the consequences.   **\nDeal prudently in your marriage, especially when your partner is not righteous. Abigail had an unrighteous husband and dealt very wisely with him. So, make sure you deal well in your home to allow righteousness to reign.  \nMay God use this book to bless your marriage and the marriages of many others through your efforts. **\nPastor Paul Rika\n",

      "body": "MAKING YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER GLAD BY YOUR LIFE  **\n\nINTRODUCTION  **\nMaking your father and mother glad by your life is an inspired book written to children and youths on submission and obedience to parents and their leaders in the way approved by God. This book will open the eyes of many children and youths to God's word and commandment to them and will compel many to submit and obey their parents. God promises reward to children that obey their parents according to the will of God. The author also stresses that the scripture condemns anyone who obeys the instruction of parents, if such are contrary to the word of God.    **\nEphesians 6 verse 1 to 3   **\n 1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this is right. \n2 Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) \n3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.   **\nThe book is written to promote godliness and holiness in children and young men and women in the church and in the society for the joy of God and their parents.\nProverbs 23 verse 25  **\n 25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. \nProverbs 27 verse 11   **\n11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.    **\nYouths who desire to please God should make this book a companion for regular reading. Parents should get this book into the hands of all their church and encourage them to read it. Families and churches can use this book as a devotional study or Sunday school manual. May the Lord use this book to deliver many young lives from the hand of Satan in Jesus name. \nIsaiah 49 verse 24, 25    **\n24 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?\n 25 But thus saith the Lord, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered,  for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.   **\nEphesians 6 verse 1 to 3    **\n1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord  for this is right. \n2 Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)\n3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.    **\nThis scripture is tied to obeying your father and mother in the Lord. Your obedience should be in areas that will make God happy with you and not in areas that will make Him sorrowful. Your father should not ask you to go and kill somebody or marry someone else's wife; neither should your mother ask you to go and steal someone's goods and you heed.    **\nDeuteronomy 13 verse 6, 8   **\n 6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;\n8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him;    **\nThat is not obedience in the Lord. God is not happy with such assignments and in that case, you and your parents will be judged, because they have used you to do wickedness. However, in matters of legitimacy, things that are right, like “fetch me water, wash plates for me, go on an errand for me”  and so on; that is good and acceptable. Make them happy by doing that and they will bless you. Even if they do not pronounce blessings on you, God will certainly bless you. If you continue in this manner, it shall be well with you in life and many death situations will be averted over you for obeying God's word towards your parents.   **\nMatthew 15 verse 4    **\n4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother; and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.    **\nHe that beats up father and mother is cursed. In fact, that child is wicked. Even if your father or mother abuses you or speaks evil against you, do not curse them. Assuming your father fights you, do not attempt to fight him back. The judgment for that is eternal death, unless you repent. Importantly, this is a commandment and God puts the blessings of life on children who are obedient to their parents. God as well curses those who are disobedient to their parents. The scripture makes it plain that parents are glad when their children behave well and are sorrowful when their children are stubborn.   **\n Proverbs 23 verse 25    **\n25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.   **\n\nCHAPTER ONE   **\nTHE WISE AND FOOLISH CHILDREN    **\n1.1 The Character of the Wise and Foolish Children.   **\n Proverbs 10 verse 1  **\nThe proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father, but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.   **\nA wise child will make the father and mother glad and even his relatives and guardians. The neighbors will appreciate him and point him as a good example to their children. On the other hand, if the child is stubborn or foolish, he will bring pain and sorrow to his or her father and mother. Have you ever thought about this, that the scriptures always emphasize on the sorrow of the wayward child on the mother and not the father? The reason is because the father will automatically turn his back on that child, denying him as his child but rather putting the waywardness of that child on the mother to bear the shame alone. Unfortunately, the mother cannot deny him so easily like the father. She must shoulder the pain and the sorrow. King Saul in his anger against Jonathan said to him “thou son of the perverse rebellious woman,”    **\nFirst Samuel 20 verse 30   **\n Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?   **\n You should understand that a wise child is a child that behaves and performs well, and is well-spoken of in the school, in the society, and in the church. People do praise and hail a child for his good conduct and excellent spirit. While on the other side of the coin, if the child is foolish, the mother will live in shame and sorrow. In the above text, was Jonathan's mother present? Not at all. What evil did she do for giving birth to Jonathan? It is because the son behaved contrarily to King Saul's interest. This make him abused and condemned the mother for giving birth to him. Here you can clearly see the weight and burden of blame that is being shifted to your mother all because of your disobedient and stubborn attitude.   **\n 1.2 Characteristics of a foolish child    **\nA foolish child is he that despises his parents and may curse or fight them.    **\nProverbs 19 verse 26   **\nHe that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.    **\nThe foolish child goes about making mockery of his parents and speaking evil against them at the slightest offence. He shows no regard to them; rather, he despises them. He is not of help to them neither does he bother about their cry for help. He does not obey their instructions, rather, he chases them away and put them to shame. Do not behave this way to your parents. Love and obey them and they will be glad that you are their son or daughter. God will bless you too.   **\n Proverbs 23 verse 15 to 16  **\n15 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. \n16 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.    **\nThis is a parent talking to the child; advising the child to submit to instruction of wisdom, to walk on the good path and to submit himself to God for a change of life so that God can make him peaceful,  happy and glad. Are you the type of child that always tell lies? Your good parents will want you to always speak the truth. God also will want you to speak the truth, even if you fear that it will hurt you. Speaking lies makes you a child of Satan.   **\nIsaiah 30 verse 9   **\n 9 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the Lord     **\n John 8 verse 44  **\n44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own;  for he is a liar, and the father of it.    **\nSome evil children beat up their parents to disgrace them or abuse them. There is a great judgment of God against such children in this world and in hellfire.    **\nProverbs 30 verse 11, 17    **\n11 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. \n17 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.   **\nProverbs 20 verse 20    **\n20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness. \nMatthew 15 verse 4    **\n4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother;  and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.    **\nSome children steal from their parents thinking it is not a sin. It is the same offence as stealing from somebody else.    **\n Proverbs 28 verse 24   **\n 24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.    **\nThere are children that will kill their father and chase their mother from the house because of their wickedness.      **\nProverbs 19 verse 26    **\n26 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.    **\nThis kind of children are corrupt and have forsaken the Lord. Satan uses them as instruments of evil and wickedness among men in the society.     **\n Isaiah 1 verse 4    **\n4 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters, they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.    **\nFirst  Samuel 2 verse 12     **\n12 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the Lord.    **\nThe situation looks more terrible and pathetic when the parents are ministers of the gospel  the society ordinarily would expect such children to be godly in their character, but Satan always try to corner them into his kingdom. That is why the children as well as their parents and the church need to pray for the deliverance of the children from the hand of Satan.    **\n1.3 What God-fearing Parents desire for their Children.    **\nParents normally instruct their children to live godly so that they can be happy. Christian parents go the extra mile to preach to their children to submit their lives to Jesus so that they also will be holy, happy and inherit the kingdom of God in the end    **\nProverbs 23 verse 24 verse 25   **\n24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice; and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him. \n25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. When you are a good child, you make them happy.   **\nYou may be the only child but how awful it is if you the only child is an armed robber. But imagine if the only child is a godly child  humble, respectful and well behaved, you will be more to your parents than 10 children, just like John the Baptist. Parents rejoice when they have good children. On the other hand, parents of bad children suffer reproach from people in their neighbourhoods, schools and in the church. People laugh and sneer at them.    **\nYour mother is in continuous sorrow and bitterness because of your contemptuous lifestyle. With this attitude, many parents plead seriously with their children not to come around when they have visitors. Their dresses are evil and ungodly. Their appearance shows insanity. Their nakedness and indecency plague their parents and bring shame to them. Hence they desire in their prayer that their children should be saved and delivered from indecent and irresponsible lifestyle that brings reproach to them. Wearing short gowns, skirts, tight fitting dresses, ungodly hair do, bleaching, funny haircut, exposing your buttocks, wearing torn dresses, etcetera. are activities that bring shame to godly parents.   **\nProverbs 27 verse 11    **\n 11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.    **\nTherefore, be a good boy and a good girl. Do not allow evil reports about you to enter the ears of your parents for what you have shamelessly done in the school or society. Change your attitude so that your parents can have what to say to their accusers if they try to reproach them. Jesus also is calling you to come and follow His lifestyle.     **\nProverbs 1 verse 22 to 23    **\n22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? \n23 Turn you at my reproof, behold, I will pour out My spirit unto you, I will make known My words unto you.    **\nGod will bless your parents and your family if you co-operate with your parents to live godly and holy life.    **\nSecond John 1 to 4    **\n1 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; \n2 For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever. \n3 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love. \n4 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.     **\n1.4 Godliness and Wisdom are good for you  **\n Proverbs 29 verse 3     **\n3 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father, but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.   **\nProverbs 4 verse 7 to 10    **\n7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom, and with all thy getting get understanding. \n8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee, she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. \n9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee. \n10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.    **\nThe word of God to you then is, give yourself to the life of truth, righteousness and holiness. Be godly and pursue wisdom. Be clothed with Jesus all the days of your life. Repent, and change the testimony of your life in the family, society and in the church. Make up your mind and change.    **\n1.5 Meditate on these words     **\nJoshua 1 verse 8    **\nThis book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein,  for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success    **\nLay hand on yourself and say I make up my mind to change today, I will no longer be wicked, I will no more be disobedient and rough in my life. I will bring good testimonies upon my life. People shall hear new things about me. My parents shall see the difference or changes in me. I will take away the anger from my father. Some of you are the reasons why your father and mother always quarrel, hence ponder on the words above and stop bringing quarrels between them.   **\nLuke 15 verse 17 to 24     **\n17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! \n18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, \n19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son, make me as one of thy hired servants. \n20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. \n21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. \n22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; 23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry \n 24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.    **\nAfter you have repented, it will do you good if you maintain righteous and holy life. join a true fellowship of God's children to learn godly teachings from the word of God.    **\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 22    **\n22 Flee also youthful lusts; but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.    **\n First John 1 verse 3 to 7     **\n3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. \n4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. \n5 This then is the message which we have heard of Him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth; \n7 But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.   **\nColossians 2 verse 6 to 8    **\n 6 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him; \n7 Rooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.\n 8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.   **\n\nCHAPTER TWO   **\nBIBLICALACCOUNTS OF SOME UNGODLY CHILDREN   **\n2.1 Examples of Children that Brought Sorrow to their Parents    **\nThe Bible gives us an account of some children that brought sorrow and shame to their parents. We shall consider five of them    **\n2.1.1 Dinah     **\n Genesis 34 verse 1 to 7    **\nAnd Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. \n2 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. \n3 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. \n4 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. \n5 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter,  now his sons were with his cattle in the field and Jacob held his peace until they were come. \n6 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. \n7 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.   **\nJacob and his family were moving to the Promised Land, so they came to a land where they camped there for a while. Then Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, went to play with the children of the land. She went, definitely unknown to her people. But that day she did not escape. They got her and defiled her in immorality, and locked her up with the man. The report got to her parents that Dinah had been deflowered. What a sorrow to her mother and to Jacob the man of God. The only female child amongst his twelve sons.     **\nLeviticus 19 verse 29     **\n29 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.    **\nHow painful it was to the brothers! It grieved them much. You think this immoral act you engage in, is a simple or light thing? It is a pain and an embarrassment to your parents and to the church. Yet this is what many youths do to corrupt themselves and bring God's judgment upon the church and their families.    **\nFirst Corinthians 5 verse 1, 2    **\n1 It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. \n2 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.    **\nFor instance, a case was brought to me of a boy that came to the 2019 international youth conference from Gwagwalada, Abuja, Nigeria, and a girl who came to the same conference from Port Harcourt, Nigeria. How they knew themselves is beyond me. I was told they went to the nearby bush to commit immorality. Although I was aware that our security personnel flogged them mercilessly and the boy was sent away from the camp. But you can imagine how this untoward act has brought sorrow and shame to their parents. I instructed that the girl should be handled appropriately and chastised for bringing disgrace to her parents. Take note of this  if you see anyone engage in this dastardly act or any form of sin, to bring shame and disgrace to the camp and people of God, the person should be rebuked and reported for appropriate action to be taken because the conferences held or organized in the name of God as well His camp should not be defiled with immorality or other sins whatsoever, for the presence of God is always with His righteous children.     **\nDeuteronomy 23 verse 14    **\nFor the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy, that He see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.    **\nEphesians 5 verse 3 to 7    **\n3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; \n4 Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient  but rather giving of thanks. \n5 For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. \n6 Let no man deceive you with vain words, for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. \n7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them.     **\nProverbs 31 verse 2 to 4    **\n 2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows? 3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings. 4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink     **\nThe devil has poured down the spirit of immorality upon the human society and even the church of Christ. Various kinds of sexual immorality are being practiced by young ones; this include  Masturbation, fornication, homosexuality, lesbianism, incest, bestiality sodomy, etc. Youths these days engage themselves in pornography and sexual films to arouse themselves. There is also child fingering and child abuse. The glory of marriage is highly reduced as many run into it because they have abused the privilege. Many come to the marriage altar already defiled and pregnant to the shame of their parents and defilement of the church. God will judge them for all these except they repent. You who fear God, remove yourself from this kind of life. Do not join them. Do not seek for a wife or husband among these kinds of youths. Walk with God in righteousness and look to Him for all your needs. Serve Him with all your heart and He will bless you.     **\nSecond Corinthians 6 verse 14 to 18.    **\n14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers, for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? \n15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? \n16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. \n17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, \n18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be My sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.     **\nIsaiah 1 verse 16 to 20    **\n16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; \n17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. \n18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. \n19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land \n 20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.     **\n 2.1.2 Simeon and Levi      **\nThese were two sons of Jacob who were prone to anger and cruelty. They were always interested in fighting other children and going for tribal war. Jacob lived in fear for the repercussions of their lives. There are children like this who are always troublesome and naughty. The police have often been called on several occasions regarding their misbehavior.    **\n Genesis 34 verse 25 to 30     **\n25 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. \n26 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. \n27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. 28 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field, \n29 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the house. \n30 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.     **\nSome children engage in smocking and taking hard drugs. Some are into great evils in the society, such as murder, assassination, armed robbery, rape etc. They are the social miscreants and political thugs. They engage in kidnapping for fast money. They will want to make friendship with you and make you join them. They engage in sensual and devilish or worldly music. Keep yourself far from them. Do not join their company nor desire their gains. They will soon disappear by death and divine judgment into everlasting fire.     **\nProverbs 1 verse 8 to 19      **\n8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother;\n9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck. \n10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. 11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause; \n12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit;\n13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil  \n14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse; 15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path; 16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. \n17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. 18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. \n19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.     **\nYou can imagine the repercussion of waywardness as portrayed in the above verses of the scripture. You are enjoined to run away or desist from evil company and character.      **\nGenesis 49 verse 6    **\nO my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united,  for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self will they digged down a wall.     **\nSome children are like this. Your parents are weeping, even cursing, because of the humiliation you are bringing to them in the society by your wayward life. Eli lamented until he died because of the evil behaviors of his children in the house of God. God killed his children because of their wicked life.     **\nFirst Samuel 2 verse 12, 17, 22 to 25, 34      **\n12 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the Lord. \n17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord,  for men abhorred the offering of the Lord. 22 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. \n23 And he said unto them, why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people. 24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear; ye make the Lord's people to transgress. \n25 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him  but if a man sin against the Lord, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the Lord would slay them. \n34 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.     **\nReject this wicked living. Turn away from those cursed boys and girls and follow Jesus.     **\nPsalms 119 verse 59, 101    **\n59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto Thy testimonies. \n101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep Thy word.  **\n2.1.3 Esau    **\nProverbs 23 verse 19   **\n19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.    **\nThe marital union of Esau with a Hittite woman was not in consonance with his parents' wish. He married anyhow to the grief of his father and mother.    **\nGenesis 26 verse 34 to 35    **\n34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite; \n35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.    **\nWhat Esau did was a grief of heart to Isaac and Rebekah. His decision and the way he went about his marriage was unbecoming, just like most youths are doing today.   **\nGenesis 27 verse 46    **\n46 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth, if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?    **\nRebekah was not happy at what Esau did and complained about it to Isaac, she feared that Jacob might do the same thing if not restrained. Some people will even prefer to go and marry Muslims, knowing fully well that they do not recognize Jesus Christ as the Lord and Savior. Others marry terrible people despite God's warning. Meanwhile, your parents who frequently attend others' wedding are waiting for your turn to come, only for the tide to change. If at your turn, it is discovered that you are already pregnant before the wedding, what a calamity and grief will that be to them!    **\nJob 3 verse 25     **\n25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.     **\nProverbs 15 verse 20    **\n20 A wise son maketh a glad father, but a foolish man despiseth his mother.   ** \nYour parents will be disappointed and ashamed to hear that their honorable son has impregnated a lady and will no longer wed with her in the church. To make matters worse, in some countries outside Africa, like Europe and America where the Bible has been turned upside down, it is the parents that submit to their children and not the other way round. 'They told the children in school to report their parents to the police if they beat them so that they will never touch them again.' This is said to be done in obedience to 'Child Rights Laws.' For instance, a woman was talking to her 8-year-old child, and she had to speak out loud because she was suffering from partial deafness. The daughter was not aware of it. So, she spoke in a loud voice to her little daughter who rather was provoked at her. Being ignorant of her hearing impairment, the daughter phoned the police. The police came in to the house to the shock of her mother. The woman asked the police what they had come for. They replied that someone had called them from the house. She wondered who the person could be, since the woman and the daughter were the only persons in the house. Then the police asked the child whether she was the one that called them. She admitted and said she was the one that called because she did not like the way her mother was shouting at her.    **\nThis attitude is quite common amongst children living in the western world because of the morally corrupt and ungodly system in place. Notwithstanding, parents should not be afraid of this. They should follow the commandments of God and the principle of the Bible. Sincerely, where it requires flogging, the children should submit to their parent's chastisement as God commanded them. Do not report your parents to the school, the police or government for beating you. If you escape your parent's punishment because of your stubbornness, God will take over your punishment which may end up in hellfire. The scripture has given the parents to train up their children in all forms of godly chastisement so that they will grow in the fear of God.   **\nProverbs 22 verse 6   **\nTrain up a child in the way he should go and when he is old, he will not depart from it.    **\nProverbs 29 verse 15    **\n15 The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.    **\n Proverbs 23 verse 13, 15    **\n13 Withhold not correction from the child, for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. \n15 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.    **\n2.1.4 Micah    **\nMicah was a thief. He stole money from his mother. The mother made enquiry concerning her money, but he hardened his heart towards it. Then, she began to rain all manner of curses on the person that took the money. In fact, the cursing became so much that Micah had to return the money instantly.    **\nJudges 17 verse 1 to 2     **\n1 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.\n2 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the Lord, my son.    **\nMany boys and girls go the way of stealing to the grief of their parents. They start gradually from the home and graduate into big time robbers in the society. Some parents even prefer their children to remain in prison to being at home because of the humiliation they receive from them.    **\nProverbs 28 verse 24    **\n 24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.    **\nApart from that, there are many sins that go with stealing, like smoking, drunkenness, and immorality. Many of these children have been empowered by the spirit of stealing. They steal against their will and have no power of their own to stop the practice. Only Jesus can save them and deliver them from that power. Young man, believe in Jesus; call on Jesus. Cry to him to deliver you.   **\nRomans 7 verse 19 to 25    **\n 19 For the good that I would I do not  but the evil which I would not, that I do.\n 20 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. \n21 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. 22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man; \n23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. \n24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?\n25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.    **\nSome children of pastors even put their parents to shame by stealing the church money that their parents keep in the house. This is an abomination which should not be found among the children of God.    **\nJeremiah 4 verse 22    **\n22 For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have none understanding, they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.    **\nProverbs 17 verse 25    **\n25 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.   **\nThe Lord is calling you, and I am pleading with you to stop your evil life and give your life to Jesus Christ so that your parents will be glad, your generation will be proud and happy about your godly lifestyle and you will make heaven at last.   **\n Acts 16 verse 30 to 31   **\n 30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\n31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.    **\nSeek deliverance in a righteous church. Seek prayers for your deliverance. Only true and righteous ministers of God can pray and break the yoke of sin or ungodliness in your life.    **\n Isaiah 10 verse 27    **\n 27 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.    **\n 2..1.5 Hophni and Phinehas     **\nThe sons of Eli Hophni and Phinehas were evil children. The Bible calls them the sons of Belial, that is, children of Satan. They were vigorously serving the devil and defiling the holy temple of God. They were greedy, adulterous, covetous and sinners. They corrupted the service of God to the grief of their father. This brought divine judgment upon them and their father. God saw Eli as a weak man; one that could not exercise his authority against the wicked acts of his children. Instead of removing them from the service of God, he behaved ordinarily towards them as they continued to desecrate the temple of God.    **\nFirst Samuel 2 verse 12, 17, 22 to 24    **\n12 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the Lord. \n17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord  for men abhorred the offering of the Lord. \n22 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.\n 23 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people. 24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear; ye make the Lord's people to transgress.    **\nThat was a weak voice without action. Due to their untoward attitude, many were no longer coming to the temple to render service to God. This is exactly what is currently happening amongst the children of the pastors. The devil is drawing close to them to fill them with all evils and cause grief to their parents. Children of pastors should know that the devil wants to use them to shame their parents and destroy their ministry. As a child of a pastor, contribute to the ministry of your parents through godly living and by resisting the devil. Avoid evil friends and those the devil sends to you to achieve his purpose. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.     **\nJames 4 verse 7     **\nSubmit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.    **\n2.2 Examples of Children that made their Parents glad  **\n The bible also gives us an account of children that made their parents glad. Some of the include the following      **\n2.2.1 JOSEPH     **\nGenesis 37 verse 1 to 16    **\n1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. \n2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. \n3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a coat of many colours. 4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. \n5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren; and they hated him yet the more. 6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed; \n7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. \n8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.\n 9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. \n10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? \n11 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. 12 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. \n13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. \n14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. \n15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? \n16 And he said, I seek my brethren; tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.     **\nJoseph was a child of joy to his parents. He demonstrated a godly attitude always, which earned him the coat with many colors by his parents. He was a righteous boy who hated iniquity. He reported the ungodly acts of his brethren to their father not in criticism but for their salvation. The godliness of Joseph brought joy to his father     **\nProverbs 23 verse 24, 25    **\n 24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him. \n25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.   **\nYoung man, young woman, make your parents glad by your character. Live a different lifestyle from that of other children in your society, and do not follow the multitude to commit sin. Be of God, Love God, and all about Jesus Christ. Be zealous in the church, serving God.    **\nProverbs 24 verse 21     **\n 21 My son, fear thou the Lord and the king and meddle not with them that are given to change;    **\nProverbs 23 verse 15 to 16    **\n15 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. 16 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.    **\nNote the following about the godly life of Joseph    **\nGenesis 39 verse 5 to 12    **\n 1 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. \n2 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. \n3 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.\n4 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. \n5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. \n6 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favored. \n7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. 8 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; \n9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife, how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? \n10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. \n11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. \n12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me  and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.     **\nFrom the above verses, we observed that   **\ni.\tThe favor of God was upon Joseph. The Lord was with him.\nii.\t Joseph was a hardworking and a successful youth. \niii.\tJoseph was a blessing everywhere he was. \niv.\tJoseph was a godly youth who feared God and hated sin. \nv.\tJoseph endured persecution and hardship without complaints. \nvi.\tGod highly exalted him. God will do so to you too, if you learn to live a godly life.   **\n2.2.2 RUTH     **\nRuth, a daughter -in- law to Naomi was raised up as a daughter to Naomi before her husband died. She was young, godly, industrious, and caring. She cared for Naomi. She was so caring that people could see it and praise Naomi. With this in mind, Naomi became interested in her marriage directing her on what to do. Naomi was impressed by her life style.     **\nRuth 3 verse 1 to 10     **\n1 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? \n2 And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor. \n3 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor, but make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.\n4 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do. \n5 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do. 6 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her. 7 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.\n 8 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself  and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. 9 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman. \n10 And he said, Blessed be thou of the Lord, my daughter for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.    **\nIt is a common thing in the world that there are boys that enchant girls with satanic power, through herbalists or (witch doctors) to trap the opposite sex. Our women (especially the female youths) should learn from Ruth in order to avoid youthful lust. Ruth cannot be trapped by that. For you to be a victim of satanic power, you have to be available for that to happen. Ruth was not going about chasing young men because of marriage, even though she had married before and knew what it was to meet with a man, yet, she still kept herself under subjection in righteousness.      **\nRuth 4 verse 13 to 15    **\n13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife, and when he went in unto her, the Lord gave her conception, and she bare a son.\n 14 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the Lord, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel. 15 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.    **\nThe love Ruth showered on Naomi was better to her than seven sons. Your love to your parents should be a comforting and unconditional love. Doing so, you are better to them than seven sons. A blessed child indeed! People saw and could testify of how Ruth loved Naomi; Can people testify of you like that concerning your parents? Are you a lover of your parents or a troubler of them? Speak good words to your parents, fill them with the thought of a good future through you. Treat your parents with genuine love and patience. Do not be like Ham that saw his father's nakedness and began to laugh. It is embarrassing to do so. Rather act like Japhet and Shem, in an honorable and reverential manner, and you will be blessed.    **\nRuth 4 verse 20 to 22    **\n20 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, 21 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, \n22 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David. From the line of David came Jesus. See the honour of Ruth. She became one of the great grandmothers of Jesus! True honour and greatness of life comes from Jesus.    **\n2.2.3 DAVID     **\nDavid was godly and had the anointing of God on him. He was a youth and had the key of Israel's victory in his hands. One thing that was clear about David was that he loved the Lord fervently. He composed so many songs for the praise and worship of God. His love and commitment to God provoked so much love from God to him.      **\nJohn 14 verse 23     **\n23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love Me, he will keep My words; and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him.     **\nDavid kept the commandment of God and was blessed by God. He did not engage himself in the worldly music or songs as the youths do nowadays. Instead, he used his talent to sing praises to God, his Creator. In short, Israel learned so much songs from him by the anointing of God on him.    **\nActs 13 verse 22     **\n22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my will.     **\nSecond Samuel 23 verse 1 to 3    **\n 1 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said, 2 The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and His word was in my tongue. \n3 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.    **\nHe was a valiant man, a warrior. In his youth he defeated Goliath and the people cheered on him and his parents for raising such a valiant child.    **\nFirst Samuel 17 verse 55 to 58    **\n55 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell. \n56 And the king said, Inquire thou whose son the stripling is. \n57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. \n58 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.    **\nDavid was overwhelmed by the victory, but Saul was deeply interested in knowing whose son he was that defeated this giant. Note that when you do good, people will be interested in knowing you to the joy and happiness of your parents. Therefore, avail yourself to be a good and wise child. Who knows, you might be the solution to the nation's troubles tomorrow!   **\nProverbs 23 verse 16, 19, 24     **\n16 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. 19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. \n24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.    **\nProverbs 27 verse 11     **\n 11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.    **\nDavid still remains an inspiration to the world today in the scriptures. Live a godly life and be an inspiration to humanity.     **\n2.2.4 ESTHER     **\nEsther was an obedient child who submitted the leadership of her life to her parents. She was a lady who did not value the use of cosmetics for artificial beauty. Her obedient spirit rewarded her with the highest position amongst women. She became the queen of the kingdom, her husband's people prospered, and her people experienced great salvation and deliverance through her.    **\nEsther 2 verse 8 to 9, 15     **\n8 So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. \n9 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king's house  and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.\n 15 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.    **\nThe materials Esther used for her dressing and adornment were not the ones sinful women used for their cosmetic beauty. Esther chose to live naturally and preferred the glory of God that followed inward beauty.     **\nFirst Peter 1 verse 3 to 5     **\n3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, \n4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, \n5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.     **\nThe glory of the Lord covered her tremendously. Due to her natural appearance, she received divine favour. This was because she received good home training. She was submissive to the instructions of Mordecai without arguments.    **\nProverbs 1 verse 8     **\n8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother      **\nProverbs 4 verse 9     **\n 9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.     **\nEsther maintained the spirit of parental obedience, even up to her marriage. This brought blessing and deliverance to her and her people.     **\nEsther 2 verse 20     **\nEsther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her, for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.    **\nSome people like to argue with their parents and pastors, even if what they are being taught is clearly from the scriptures. Some children are difficult to correct. They feel they know everything already, because of their pride. God deprives such people true knowledge.     **\nProverbs 26 verse 16    **\nThe sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.     **\nLuke 10 verse 1 to 24    **\n 1 After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent them two and two before His face into every city and place, whither He Himself would come. \n2 Therefore said He unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few  pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He would send forth labourers into His harvest. 3 Go your ways, behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. 4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes and salute no man by the way. \n5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. 6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; if not, it shall turn to you again. \n7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give  for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. 8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you;\n9 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you \n10 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, \n11 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth because your names are written in heaven. \n21 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes  even so, Father; for so it seemed good in Thy sight. \n22 All things are delivered to Me of My Father,  and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him. \n23 And He turned Him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see; \n24 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.     **\nThe above verses show the actual and/or possibility of the stubbornness of man, especially the children or the youth, that Satan could harden their hearts against the truth or word of God. It is dangerous, for God's judgment upon such recalcitrant youth or children will be grievous, for they hear the truth and hardened their hearts.   **\nEsther was a humble woman. That was why she rose to the position of a queen. She was not appearing naked as many ladies do today. She was obedient and was in submission to her parents and to the word of God. This is exactly what defines the greatness of a person. God determined the husband Esther should marry according to the plan God had for her. God has a suitable person for you to marry according to His will. If you are humble and obedient as Esther, you will meet your marriage partner at the appointed time.     **\nJeremiah 29 verse 11 to 13     **\n11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. \n12 Then shall ye call upon Me, and ye shall go and pray unto Me, and I will hearken unto you. \n13 And ye shall seek Me, and find Me, when ye shall search for Me with all your heart.    **\nMany boys and girls spoil their destiny through ungodly marriage which is outside God's plan. Be like Esther. Marry in God's will and bless your life, your family, your society, the church and the entire world!     **\n2.2.5 TIMOTHY      **\nTimothy's life is a model for youths who desire to go into ministry and succeed in it. He was a trainable child. He was a goodly boy to his father and a helper to Paul the apostle in ministry. After the ministry of Paul, he continued the work of God as his successor.     **\nSecond Timothy 1 verse 5 to 6    **\n 5 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.\n 6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.    **\nThe family submitted to God and Paul's ministry. Paul testified of the godly training inculcated into Timothy by his parents. He saw it as a gift and a treasure that will help spur his ministerial work.     **\nPhilippians 2 verse 19 to 22     **\n19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. \n20 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.\n21 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's. 22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.    **\nPaul said, Timothy was unique even among others. He was completely submissive. He was much concerned about the affairs of Jesus. He was zealous for the things of Jesus. He yielded fully to it. We are looking for people like this that are fully committed and dedicated to the work of God in righteousness and truth. He was fully acquainted to the doctrines of truth, righteousness and holiness.    **\n Second Timothy 3 verse 15 to 17    **\n15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; \n17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.    **\nTimothy was an example of a life of righteousness and holiness to others. (both young and old)    **\nFirst Timothy 4 verse 12      **\n12 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.    **\nThe likes of Timothy are highly needed for end time revival of holiness worldwide  young men and women in Christ that will preach the truth and be an example in practical godliness are needed for the work of God.     **\nDeuteronomy 30 verse 15 to 20     **\n15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; \n16 In that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply; and the Lord Thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it. \n17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; \n18 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it. \n19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live  \n20 That thou mayest love the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey His voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto Him; for He is thy life, and the length of thy days,  that thou mayest dwell in the land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.    **\nThe summary of it all to both children and youths is  the Lord set before you this day good and evil, blessing and cursing, life and death. On the righthand side are  obedience to God, submission to parents, doing good to them, making them glad and eternal life at the end. On the left-hand side are  evil, cursing, wickedness, stubbornness, rebellion, death and hellfire at the end. However, if you want to continue in your wicked lifestyle, the choice is yours to make, and the decision is yours to take. But I counsel you to choose good, blessing and life so that people can speak good of you and so that the church, your parents, and the society can be impacted positively and richly by your godly life. Amen.\n",

      "body": "Marital Sex, Child Bearing, Adoption and Family Planning.   **\n\nIntroduction **\n The issues bordering on marital sex, child bearing, adoption and family planning are very sensitive and a wrong conception or knowledge about them can make or mar a home and affect one’s Christianity and eventual entry into heaven. Getting and applying the right knowledge of it can make your home heaven on earth and promote your Christian life and testimony. The book exposes deep biblical truth on marital sex, child bearing, adoption and family planning, which if applied will transform your home. Get it right from the right source and not from just anybody so that your life will not be scattered by misleading information. The live teachings of the contents of this book will transform so many Christian homes with great testimonies abounding. May the Lord guide you as you read on these sensitive issues as put forward in this book. **\n\nChapter One  Introduction   **\n \nAdd to your Faith, knowledge  Get the Right information from Matured Servants of God    **\nThe subjects, marital sex, child bearing, adoption and family planning are very sensitive and a wrong conception or knowledge about them can make or mar a home and affect one’s Christianity and eventual entry into heaven. Getting and applying the right knowledge of it can make a home, heaven on earth and promote your Christian life and Testimony. The bible says, “….add to your faith, knowledge. Second Peter 1 verse 5. Faith alone is not enough to handle issues bordering on these areas of life; therefore, it is very important to get knowledge about them; not just any knowledge, the right knowledge. So many Christian couples have  made and taken wrong decisions due to the wrong teachings they received on them, such that many of them rather than enjoying are enduring their marriages and some have separated, divorced or even remarried. \nIt is dangerous to get knowledge from babes i. e. those who are not matured in the word of God, half-baked or those who misinterpret the word of God. You need to get the knowledge, to add to your faith, from matured servants of God, who are exercised in the full gospel and rightly divide the Word of Truth. These are established upon the scriptures and the truth gives eternal life.    **\n\n\nMatthew 28 verse 20    **\nTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.”    **\n\nMalachi 2 verse 4 to 7    ** \n4 “And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. \n5\tMy covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name. \n6\tThe law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips  he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity. \n7\tFor the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth, for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.”     **\nHere we are told that we should teach all things the Lord has commanded us. The scripture tells us that all things essential for life and godliness have been given to us already (second Peter 1 verse 3), and it is the responsibility of the priest that knows God, to have the word of truth, the word of wisdom and understanding, so that people can come and enquire the mind of God from him. People should enquire the mind of God from the priest/man of God who rightly divides the word of truth. \nWhat is the reason why there are differences in doctrine and in interpretations in the churches of Christ today? The Bible tells us in  **\nHebrews 5 verse 13 to 14. \n “For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness  for he is a babe. 14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.” There are people that are babes and will not be able to bring forth truth as it is; they will not be able to clearly divide the word of truth. They are babes not because they just got newly born again, but because they are far behind in the practice of the word of Holiness and truth. It is not of age nor the size of their congregation but how much of God they know “He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me  (and knows me).” (John 14 verse 21). The knowledge of God is in the word and the practice of the word. People who do not have much knowledge of the word, and some of the people who just pick an area of the word of God and specialize on it but are not aware of many other areas of God’s word, are all babes. They may pick on healing and major on it, or on deliverance or on prosperity and major on it. What about other areas of life on holiness, on matters of righteousness, matters of truth, restitutions? They are not aware of them and do not practice those other areas, it is because they are not aware of the fullness of truth. If they are not aware of the fullness of truth, they cannot practice the fullness of life and they cannot know God. They are babes. And when these ones bring up ideas, interpretations, coin out doctrines, they cannot arrive at the truth. How much more of areas that are difficult, that need exercise of the mind; they cannot come out with anything. And that is why you see confusion and division in the churches of Christ. But the Bible says those who are used to strong food, and have learned of it and are practicing it, have their hearts exercised to discern. They can easily hear and understand; they can hear and say this it. Why? They have been patterned to that. So we are not moved by revelations, we are established upon the scriptures, the truth gives eternal life not revelation. Any revelation that contradicts the scripture is not the voice of God or else it is these babes who maybe saw a true revelation but lack the interpretation. Why? They are babes. “For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness  for he is a babe.” Hebrews 5 verse 13.    **\nWhen somebody, because he or she got a revelation of or from Jesus, feels or thinks that he or she is now an authority in Christian doctrine, that person is a babe and his or her listeners who also think likewise, that the person is now an authority in Christian doctrine, are also babes. Because it takes time to study and become an authority in a field. It is not a dream of one day. For somebody to be called a doctor of philosophy, he did not go to school for two or even five years. He has been in the field of learning over ten years. You cannot compare him (who has been studying over ten years) in knowledge with somebody who just dreamt a dream yesterday, or somebody who just graduated yesterday. You cannot compare a doctor of philosophy in knowledge with someone who said he discovered a book just yesterday. That he discovered a book does not make him a great authority? Has he even understood what is written on that book? Understanding takes time to grow; it metamorphoses, because “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child  but when I became a man, I put away childish things.” First Corinthians 13 verse 11.    **\n\nI read that book but I thought like a child. When I became an adult I went to that book and I reasoned on it as a man. Your brain has to mature. How will you think that because somebody got a revelation, Jesus took him/her to heaven or hell, you are scattered to the point that if you are looking for truth it is that person only that will give you truth? You are out of course. The Lord will not put His secret of truth on such ones because there are firstly apostles. “And God hath set in the church, first apostles….” (First Corinthians 12 verse 28). People that are exercised in these things, have followed on, learned them and have understood them. I am saying this so that you will not allow any unverified revelations to scatter your lives. Not because you want to go to heaven, then you ask the people who had those revelations to tell you what the next thing is or what next Jesus said? We do not want to train Christians to be such type of people, because all Jesus has to say have been said already in the bible, those other ones are confirmations just to strengthen us according to divine wisdom.    **\n\nTherefore, on issues bordering on the subject of this book, get your knowledge from knowledgeable and experienced men and women of God. That is why this book is written to give you true knowledge on these subjects. Get it right from the right source and not from just anybody so that your life will not be scattered by misleading information. May the Lord guide you as you read on these sensitive issues as put forward in this book.    **\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nChapter Two  Sexuality or Love Making Between Husband and Wife   **\nWe are going to consider sexuality/love-making in marriage in Biblical perspective. It is a wide topic in itself but the emphasis here is on holiness, for truth and perfection, so that this area should not affect your Christian life. The emphasis and goal of all that will be considered here is holiness. Paul said, “Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom….” What is the aim? “…that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.” (Colossians 1 verse 28). The Lord has chosen us, the Lord had planned from the beginning that we will be used by him, and that is why we must be fortified and leave no stone unturned, in getting the knowledge of truth because truth is a weapon.    **\n  \nDivine Counsel on Right and Wrong Attitudes in Sexuality   **\nProverbs 5 verse 18 to 19 \n“Let thy fountain be blessed  and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. \nLet her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.”    **\nThis is speaking to the man, of course both the man and woman, because love is involved. Release your heart to love your wife. Without a heart released to love that woman, sexuality/lovemaking will be affected; the pleasure of it will be affected, it may affect one or both partners. So the Lord says, that woman you have as a wife is blessed and a gift of God, “Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD” (Proverbs 18 verse 22). Please let your wife be blessed, bless her all the time, be happy with her, love her, care for her, and appreciate her body. The Lord, who spoke these things, knows of the sizes of women, that some have small bodies, some, of course, have medium size bodies and some are really fat, but that is not the interest of God. He said your wife, whosoever she is, is blessed, she is a gift of God. Work on your heart to accept this truth.   **\n “Let  thy fountain be blessed  and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.” Rejoice, do not keep a frowning face, do not be tough in the face and do not be speaking to her in anger. It will affect lovemaking/sexuality in her because you will be a terror to her and her body will not respond to you. However sweet the soup is, if you are eating that soup by compulsion you will never know the sweetness of it. You need liberty, you need freedom, you need to relax in order to eat and know the sweetness of a thing. When there is always quarrelling, fighting, criticism, sexuality is affected. It is a delicate issue. When there is rough language or hard face from a woman, the body of the man will cool down, he will not have strength again. The emotion raised has to be sustained and since it is emotion it can easily die. That is why holiness, righteousness, love, truth, play significant role in marital sexuality/love-making.  **\n\n“Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times”. This scripture therefore shows that, you, woman should release the whole of your body. Do not restrict your husband; allow him access to any part of your body that will satisfy him, because God wants the satisfaction of that man, and whichever part of your body will give the man satisfaction, give him access to it. Similarly man, God wants the satisfaction of that woman. Give her access to whichever part of your body that will give her satisfaction. We had a marriage seminar sometime many years ago and a woman’s problem, in that seminar, was that she did not know the sexual organ of her husband. According to her, they were always meeting in darkness and since she could not look down there, she had never seen it. They do not take their bath together, not even going to the bathroom to see how her husband looks like. It was disturbing her and that became her concern. She wants to know how that thing looks like but she is deprived access to it, because the man would always say the light must be off. Please give each other freedom. There is no boss in that matter. We are eating food; you want to know who is senior in eating? Seniority does not count in eating food; everybody has a stomach that is hungry. So that is what the word of God is telling us.   **\n\n“Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.” “Let her” in your heart, train yourself to see pleasantness in your wife; preach to yourself. The devil will not want you to see pleasantness in your wife. He has many reasons why you should discard her and he has many reasons to give you why you are better than and superior to her. Do not accept that. Go the way of God that cherishes the woman. That woman is a soul, a precious soul. Which soul is fatter than another? It is the body you are seeing not the soul. The soul is the delight of the great God. In the same way woman, work on your heart and do not despise your husband in your heart as Michal did to David. Satan will want you to despise that man and give you many reasons why you should despise him. If you do that, it is to your hurt because as you make your bed so you will lie on it; that water that is calm, having clean top, which you want to stir up into mud, is the same water you will drink; that wrong attitude that you have towards that man will affect your sexuality/love-making. Poor you, you are not enjoying love-making, which God preciously gave as a gift to humanity. Why? You allowed Satan to come in between you and your husband. You allowed evil thoughts to rule your heart. You allowed yourself to have a tough face that has no joy in it, no pleasure and so does not stir anybody.   **\n\nBe satisfied with her love, never think of another woman. Please when you are making love with your wife do not say or even think, ‘I get more pleasure when I imagine that, I am with the other woman’. That is sin, you are committing adultery. “The thought of foolishness is sin…..” (Proverbs 24 verse 9). It is unrighteousness and all unrighteousness is sin. What makes you to be imagining another person? That is a lie, it is the Devil’s lie. Refuse that imagination of someone else. Your imagination of yourself being with another man when your husband is coming in to you is a sin. That pleasure you are receiving is a pleasure of deceit and you will give account of it. That is not the way God made sexuality/love-making. It is not pure, fight against it, resist it, go against it. And some of you have been very wild when you were a sinner. You were wild in sexuality; you committed sexual immorality to the sky, your record was heard of in America, you have travelled to many countries committing sexual immorality, but now, thank God, mercy has come and you are born again. Do not expect your husband to be like the numerous men that have gone through you. Do not expect him to reach that level. No! Work on yourself and pray for grace. It is like somebody who has been a business man who does contracts in millions here and there and then a circumstance happened to him, his business failed and now he is doing a salary job where at the end of the month they put something small in his hand. You know such a person will say, is it I that receive this thing? Work on your heart, your body and your mind and appreciate it. Man, your innocent wife now in righteousness and holiness cannot be as rough as those harlots you were going to. Some of them used drugs to make their body the way it is and you are thinking that your wife should be able to make-up as the prostitutes who go on training for their business? You complain that she is supposed to be like this or like that. Come back to understanding, you are not in that world again. Come down to the world of righteousness and holiness and receive as the Lord gives you there. “A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.” (Psalm. 37 verse 16). That which you feel is not full, because you had seen greater ones, is the best because your conscience is free.  **\n\nSex is a divine provision, it is God that gave it. It is a divine mystery and we cannot imagine it. How is it that you people (married couple), have been living together and having sex all this while and yet are not satisfied? It is a real mystery. You have been looking at the private body of your wife for how many years now, yet you are not over yet. It is a training you do not graduate from; it is new every time. The thing looks new every time, it is a mystery. Again sex is given for intimacy. It is God’s design that there can be such bodily intimacy and closeness and warmth, which gives the heart peace and pleasure. When it is well practiced, the heart is joyful, the heart is happy, and there is a kind of power in the man that turns him off-sense such that if he does not control himself he will begin to make many promises there; it is a mystery for intimacy.   **\n\nSex is also for procreation/child bearing. It is the method which God has given for child bearing. Again it is for protection, \n“Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.” (First Corinthians 7 verse 2). It will protect you from sin, it will protect you from sickness, and it will protect you from death, for many have died by it. It is for protection. Then it is for enjoyment. Ecclesiastes 9 verse 9 “Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity  for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.” Live joyfully. Go and pray that it will happen. Perhaps your tradition has affected you, go and lose yourself from that tradition and go the Bible way. Perhaps in your tribe, your tradition does not recognize the woman, she is a property. You just come into her and go your way; when you have finished with her you tell her to move. No, it should not be so. There should be joy in dealing with that woman, joy and happiness should be there. The woman should see somebody excited before her, she should see somebody blessed, and she should see somebody appreciative. That makes her blessed, that makes her fulfilling something, she has a ministry in the house and that ministry is prospering. That is how it should be - joyfully. If you do not live fully with that woman and you happened to die, she will regret it. ‘My husband did not satisfy me’ will be her concern after your death. If you do not release yourself fully to that man and you happen to die before that man; that vacuum you have created will make him feel you did him evil, even after your death. Why do you want that? You are alive; only one life, give the best you can to your wife; give the best you can to your husband. Only one life that when you go, like Tabitha, your husband will raise up your good works as it is, passionately in his heart. Your wife will raise up your good works as they are, passionately in her heart. Therefore change from today and go and do the right thing, go and be a good spouse sexually.   **\n \n \nMethod of Love making    **\nThere is no scriptural method outlined for love-making. God is the author of varieties as we see in all His creation; foods, fruits, human beings themselves, animals, and colours; he is the God of varieties. It is said that variety is the spice of life; that is our God. There is no definite method given in scripture but whichever method gives you pleasure, gives her pleasure, can be explored because it is for your pleasure; it is given to you. The food was given to you; I know you will not eat it through your nose because it is dangerous but with your mouth. Do you want to stand up and eat that food? Eat, there is nothing wrong with that. Or do you want to be jumping up while eating? The method of eating that food is not described. Do you want to mix the food and the soup and eat? Does that give you pleasure? There is no sin in doing that. Whichever way by which the food passes through your mouth to your stomach, which gives you satisfaction and joy so that you turn and say I bless you, Lord Divine for giving me food; the Lord gives you liberty.    **\n\nNote that what the people of the world call oral sex is not recognized by the bible. It is an unclean practice.  **\n Romans. 1 verse 26 to 30   **\n\n“For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections;  for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature; \nAnd likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. \nAnd even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; \nBeing filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, \n26\tBackbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disbedient to parents,”   **\n\nRomans. 1 verse 26 “For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections  for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature.”  There is that which is natural, there is that which is against nature. It goes on to say in verse 24, “Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves.” Sucking the private part of your spouse is uncleanness. It is not part of sex, it is the people of the world that call it oral sex. Does the Bible provide for that? I will give the reason why. Lust is what is causing that. See verse 27. “And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman,” Can you understand now? Natural! The men leave the natural use of the women. Verse 28 says, “And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind”. Those things came out of corrupt minds. Again the Bible tells us in 29to30, “Being filled with all unrighteousness. Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things”. That is an evil invention. You call it oral sex but it is an evil invention. It is not sex. Sex is only through the genital/sex organs. The people of the world, because God has given them up to do what they want to do, device many things in this area of sexuality. Please do not go on them, go on that which is natural. Do not go and be watching blue-films, because you want to make love to your wife and so you both sit down and watch blue-films. Should Satan lecture you before you go on to carry out that which God graciously gave you? Should Satan lecture you? “I will set no wicked (evil) thing before mine eyes….” (Psalm 101 verse 3) You allow abomination to be done in your sight. “Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity….” (Psalm 119 verse 37). You allow vanity to be before you and say it is helping you? Do you know how much that thing is sponsored by the devil? Do you know that wherever it is played demons are there and God gives way? God has to give way because you have gone into the territory of Satan; God is not there and those demons will possess you. Your mind will be obsessed. You get really moved for your wife but for how long? Even if you keep on watching it a time will come when it will not move you again. Corruption! You are a Christian why are you following the world and why are you doing what is of the world? Why use the methods of the world? No! Do not watch pornography. Do not watch naked people on picture with the intention that you want your body to be moved. If your body finds it difficult to move, ask God to help you.   **\nAgain, why do we say oral sex is unscriptural? It is because one primary reason for sex or intercourse or love-making is child bearing.   **\nGenesis 4 verse 1 to 2   **\n“And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord. \nAnd she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.”   \nAnd Adam knew Eve his wife” Adam had intercourse with Eve or Adam had sex with Eve. That was not Oral sex. The result of the sex with her is that a child was formed. Then, there is the natural way this can be done. There is a sexual part designed by God in a man and in a woman. Sex is the rubbing and a play between the sexual parts. Your mouth is never a sexual part, except for kissing, which is ok. Kissing is not just for sex it is a communication of love “Greet one another with an holy kiss.” (First Corinthians 16 verse 20, Second Corinthians 13 verse 12). Kissing is a communication of love and since love-making is a love atmosphere, it can be done. But oral sex is not scriptural because it does not produce children. That which produces children is that which is natural, an interplay between the sexual parts of a woman and a man. It is an abomination to lick the genital or to use the woman’s anus as the homosexuals do. It is an abomination because the woman’s anus, in fact anus in general, is not a sexual part. It is those inventors of evil things who God has abandoned to themselves that practice such. May be they will eventually also use the eyes, the ear or may force the nose to expand for their sexual perversion/uncleanness! These are people given over to burn in their lust and ready for hell. Stay clear from these things.    **\n \nUnderstanding Sexuality    **\nHowever, clean and healthy knowledge of sexuality is important. It is not good for man to be without knowledge. Some of us still remain traditional without improving; science is discovering many good things for us, even in this area science have discovered many good things. Pure, good, healthy knowledge has come up and the Bible tells in Second Peter 1 verse 5, “And beside this, giving all diligence…..”, mark the word “all diligence” i.e. use strength, be fervent about it, “add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge”. Are you a man of God? Know about sexuality also. Add to that man of God; to that which you have known about Jesus, add the knowledge of sexuality. The clean, good, pure discoveries on love-making is helpful. You want to give your wife the best; you want to give your husband the best in this area in the life of your vanity on earth? Add to yourself knowledge. Learn good and healthy methods and manners of satisfying your spouse. Get good books on marital sex and read to improve your sexuality and to overcome marital sexual problems. Others have gone through the problems you are going through but they overcame and the answers are written for you in books. Add to your faith knowledge so you can have victory over that type of problem. Get more knowledge so that you can have fruitful sexuality and satisfying performance. Learn it, study and add to yourself. Do you need to know how to do it to produce children? Go and read books, make enquiries there are answers for you. God is saying this because all things are yours, for your benefit, improvement and for your betterment. Yes. Seek counsel for your happiness and the happiness of your spouse. Seek advice on how you can do it better and overcome, so that you and your spouse will be happy.     **\nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 1 to 5   **\n“Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me, It is good for a man not to touch a woman. \nNevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. \nLet the husband render unto the wife due benevolence; and likewise also the wife unto thehusband. \nThe wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. \nDefraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your  incontinency.”    **\nNow note the following in sexuality and take heed to observe them    **\n1  The Bible says do not deprive your husband your body, it is a sin; do not deprive your wife your body. If it is sickness or some impediment or impairment, let there be an explanation. Explain it carefully so that it will not seem to be wickedness, so that it can become mutual matters for prayers. ‘Oh I’m tired’ give careful explanation. ‘Oh I can’t tell why my body is not moving’, tell it the way it is. ‘Something is wrong with me somewhere’, yes Satan seems to interfere in that area also. So, there is nothing wrong with discovering Satan’s hand work on you somewhere, but bring it out clearly. But if you are healthy and you deny your spouse sex because you are that angry bossy type, then prepare for hell. There is a woman who used to deny her husband her body on bed. She usually, used all the pillows to divide the bed into two  one side for herself and the other side for her husband and she will tell her husband not to cross over to her. Her husband was a pastor. Jesus visited that woman by revelation and He told her, “if this is the last day of your life I would have cast you into hell, because my servant, your husband is serving me and I am happy with him and I want him to be peaceful, joyful and I want him to do my work happily, to enjoy you and be thanking me but you are frustrating him. Many things that man would have done for me you hindered him.” Do you know woman, that there are times when your husband stays too long on bed, it is because he is praying perhaps you could open for him? The work he would have gone to do for which you kept him rolling on the bed, you will explain to God. He would have had some pleasuring before going for divine service or maybe he was even travelling and he felt he should have some pleasuring but he could not do it and he travelled in anger, you will pay for it. Don’t you know that you have been bought with a price? You were bought two times while the man was bought one time. How were you bought two times? The man bought you and Jesus bought you – that is two. The man was bought only by Jesus, so which pride are you exercising now? So serve your masters, the man and Jesus Christ, and receive the double blessings too. You have the chance to receive double, from the man and from Jesus. So be faithful and if there is any problem explain well. Seek a gentle way of explanation and not like when a mother dog wants her little ones to stop sucking the breast milk it refuses them in anger. Is that the way you act in that house? Be gentle, loving, and peaceful and ask God to help your husband to understand in case of difficulty.    **\n\nI  There should be mutual agreement if for any reason you may stay away. Otherwise there should be regularity in sex or lovemaking, except for any impairment, then this should be explained. The Lord says, “Do not defraud one another except with consent that you may fast but after that come together”. It is a thing you are expected to be regular in doing. God who made it says make it regular for it will help your lives, it will keep your hearts purified. Every offence dies when there is a genuine sexual intercourse. Offences of the mind disappears; make it regular.    ** \nII  There should be mutual protection from sin and Satan. You are free and do not bother, but what about your partner? Do you know what the devil is doing with her? Do you know the thoughts that Satan is bringing upon that man as he walks on the street? You are there to protect him from Satan, so that those thoughts can clear away from his emotions and for him to come to himself. When you have eaten good food to your satisfaction any other food you see will not interest you. It is to the hungry that every bitter thing is sweet. If you can satisfy one another, you will despise anybody else you see on the street. Even those girls opening their bodies on the street your husband will despise them. They may be more beautiful than you, the matter is not beauty this time, it is now the matter of satisfying the body - he will despise them. And you the man too, satisfy your wife, if you do, she will not bother or mind other men. It will be clear when it is Satan coming now in temptation because your hands are clean.    **\n\nIII  There must be spouse pleasing in supply. A man came to me for counselling some time ago and said his wife does not allow him to go for the second round. Wife, if you are the type whose husband asks for second round, please try to supply him. I know you have learned to be patient, so just try at least once in a while otherwise the man will not be satisfied and will be crying, so try to be spouse pleasing. Go an extra mile to please your spouse in this matter. Or it could be the other way round, let the man try also to supply.     **\n\nIV  Let there be self-control. Man, let there be self-control otherwise a good thing will turn into a bad one. If you push somebody to the wall the person will react. In other words when you take it to the excess your partner might react. If you push the woman to the wall she will react. Please, know this and pray to God to help you, to give you self-control, and He will help you. You know, if your watch is working too fast there is a way to reduce the speed. In the same way, take yourself to God in prayer to reduce your speed; ask God to reduce your speed because you are too fast for your wife. Your wife may not walk as fast as you do, always remember and wait for her. So control yourself, train and discipline yourself. Don’t you fast? Do you eat food every day? Then how will you be a strong Christian? We fast! Some go on fasting for days. Can’t you abstain for some time and rest, so that when you come together the whole thing will be fresh and beautiful?  There should be self-control.  ** \nV  There should be patience in unfavourable situation because we are in this life of challenge. There might be sickness or the other partner might have a problem. What about fasting that may become necessary? So let there be patience, bear with one another. The number of times you meet in love-making before you die is not required for you to go to heaven. It is not one of the qualifications for heaven. You will not need to show the number of times you meet before you die to God in heaven. Please bear it, it is of the flesh and the flesh will pass away. Control yourself when it is required and practice patience.    **\nVI  There should be understanding of each other. Understanding will keep you therefore understand each other. \nVII  Pray for divine presence and blessing. Divine presence to make the occasion sweet and fine. Divine blessing to make it achieve its purpose which may be child bearing or any other purpose you have in mind. Pray to God. In case there be any interference of Satan, through prayer you will overcome it. Pray for your wife privately; pray for your husband privately and pray together also for God will hear you and perfect matters.    **\nVIII  There should be privacy in love-making between husband and wife. This is very important so as not to allow children and others who are around be emotionally stirred and polluted. Open sex usually is a problem of poverty, I pray that the Lord will help you. Imagine, you and your matured children sleep in one room and you make love in the same room where they are. Do you have understanding of what you are doing? You are affecting those children for their lifetime; the whole of their lifetime. How poor are you that you cannot redeem the situation? I was told of some children whose parents stopped them from watching pornography but sleep in the same room with their parents. They only used a curtain to separate/divide in between the room i.e. between them and their children. During their love-making the children will not sleep; they are awake and very much interested in what is going on between their parents. As I was told, the children went and hung a mirror on the ceiling so that they will be watching their parent’s performance/love-making. These children are intelligent and before you know it they start making love with each other. You taught them how to do it, you exposed them. Are you too poor that you cannot rent another house? Cry to the God of righteousness, He will answer you.    **\nIX  For those who have an unbelieving partner, faith, prayer, endurance and wisdom are required and the grace of God will be sufficient for you. If you accept fear that your husband has brought HIV, or you heard that he is going after a woman, you will ruin that house. If you refuse your spouse your body because of that, it will affect your eternity. It is better you are sick and go to heaven than that you are strong and go to hell. Who told you that you will be sick? Take your case to God and say, ‘God, it is because of your word I am doing this, and you know the danger in it, but for your word’s sake I am doing this, help me O God!’ The Lord will help you, the sickness will not cross over to you, so be peaceful. What about the drunkard with all the odour, what will you do? “Whatever, my Lord, thou has taught me to say, it is well, it is well with my soul.” It is well with your soul. Maintain the righteousness of your soul, although your nose is breathing differently, the Lord will help you. May the Lord hear your cry for the salvation of that man, but be faithful still. Ask for counsel where it is required.    ** \n \nChapter Three Child Bearing     **\nChild bearing is one of the purposes of marriage. It is God’s will for you to conceive and give birth to children. The Bible made us to understand that God made every living thing on the earth to have its seed, after its own kind (Genesis 1 verse 21 to 25). \nGenesis 1 verse 28     **\n“And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” \nGod wants you to be fruitful, God wants you to multiply, and He wants you to give birth to children. See,   **\n First  Timothy 5 verse 14. \n“I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.”    **\n“The younger women marry, bear children”. Woman, this is the will of God for you, that you should bear children. That is what God wants. Younger women marry, bear children! Children are the blessings of the Lord, happy is the man that has his quiver full of them. This is actually true in some respect, very true; some are happy indeed though for some it is sorrow. They wish they had not given birth to one. But, children, indeed are a blessing and God wants you to have them. He also wants you to be happy, this you should know by scripture.  \nGod is the one that gives children. The Lord made you, created you and designed you to carry and deliver children. It is His will and desire; He gave the command, “Be fruitful”. The scripture testify to this.    **\nPsalms 127 verse 3 to 5    **\n“Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD  and the fruit of the womb is his reward. \nAs arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth. \nHappy is the man that hath his quiver full of them, they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.”    **\nPsalms 128 verse 3     **\nThy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house; thy children like olive plants round about thy table.”    **\n \nGenesis 33 verse 5     **\n“And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given to thy servant.”      **\n\nGenesis 4 verse 1, 25    **\n “And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the Lord.” \n2 “And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth  For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.”     **\n\nGenesis 17 verse 16     **\n“And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her, yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.”     **\nGenesis 21 verse 1 to 2    **\n“And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. \nFor Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.”   **\n \nFirst Chronicles 25 verse 5b     **\n“And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters.” \nFirst Chronicles 26 verse 4 to 5 (paraphrased) \n“Obed-edom had eight sons \"for God blessed him.”    **\n\nPsalms 139 verse 13 to 14     **\n“For thou hast possessed my reins  thou covered me in my mother's womb. \nI will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made\nmarvelous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.”  \nFrom the above verses, you can see that child bearing is God’s purpose and will for his children and that God is the giver of children.     **\n \nDelay in child bearing     **\nChildbearing can be delayed or blocked. Some women conceive and bear children quickly e.g. Leah, however, there are cases where childbearing is delayed or blocked, for example, Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Hannah and Elizabeth. The devil has destroyed so many homes as a result of this delay. Women are the ones mostly affected by this. A lot of women are in pain and anguish because of delay in child bearing, because of mockery (like Hannah), stigmatization and evil label by their neighbors, in-laws, especially mothers-in law and some even from threats by their husbands of marrying another wife or divorce. This has made such women to seek help where they are not supposed to; they put their hands into evil and enter into the traps of the devil all in a bid to get a child. A story was told of a woman who was given cow dung mixed with some concoction or so to drink in the southern part of Nigeria, all in the bid to get the fruit of the womb. See what you do to yourselves. \nBut how are you, a child of God, supposed to respond to this situation? What do you do if you have a delay in child bearing and people mock and call you barren? Perhaps your neighbors even hinder you from relating with or sending their children on an errand e.g. Rachel.    **\n \nA Christian’s response to delay in child bearing    **\n1  Set God first  A Christian must set God above marriage partner, children, and family wealth. God must be above your husband, above your wife, above children, above wealth.     **\nPsalms 73 verse 25   **\n“Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.”     **\nMake sure the desire for your husband is not above God. Woman, make sure your desire for children is not above God. Christian families, make sure your desire for money or to have children in your marriage should not overrun that for God. Who again do you have in heaven; do you have a husband that will take you to heaven? No! It is God. Who again is of utmost help for your eternal life on earth? It is God. So that should be in your heart. Let your joy be full in the Lord. Know this and set God first. Let him be your all in all. \n2  Be contented  The believer therefore must learn contentment in this life in whatever state God puts him or allows him to be. \nLearn contentment in this life.    **\nFirst Timothy 6 verse 6 to 7    **\n“But godliness with contentment is great gain. \nFor we brought nothing into this world, (not even children) and it is certain we can carry nothing out.”     **\nSo be very careful, learn contentment. “We brought nothing into this world and it is (very) certain we can carry nothing out”, therefore they are vanity. The Bible says, “….all the years of your vanity….” (Ecclesiastes 9 verse 9),  in these years of vanity you have got some children which you are not sure of carrying out, do not allow vanity to affect reality; heaven is a reality. How many of these children will be born again and go to heaven? How many of them will be pastors? Then why are running after it to the point of affecting reality, affecting your soul. Do not get so mad with looking for children that you get angry with God to the extent that your godliness is affected. A story was also told about another woman in the middle-belt of Nigeria, who was angry at God because she had been married for about four years with no issue. She stopped praying to God and decided, due to impatience, to handle the issue herself. She, probably was the one that, convinced her husband that they should go for in-vitro fertilization and they did. After spending over a million naira to get pregnant through that way, the baby flushed out i.e. aborted. “Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not.” (Lam. 3 verse 37). God made her to understand that she is just flesh and cannot help Him and that He is the giver of children; if He does not permit it, it will not stand. They learnt their lesson and later adopted a boy who they took very good care of, then God, in his mercy, blessed them with their own baby (a baby girl). Of course, their adopted boy is their first child, and if you are not told, you will not know that he is not their biological child. God will not reject any man or woman that does not have a child neither will He remove such a person’s name from the book of life or deny him/her entry into heaven. Why are so mad, on the street, so mad at your husband, so mad at your wife to the point that your godliness is affected. “Godliness with contentment is great gain.” Great gain not small gain; that you pass through this life and you do not have children but you are godly and you have contentment you have gained the best thing that any man can gain in this world. Great gain because it gives eternal life. Haman boasted of his seven children and they were hung in one day. So be very careful, let us pay attention to what matters. Do not allow anything of this earth to affect you. The Bible says, “And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.” (I Tim. 6 verse 8). Do you eat, do you have clothes? God has given you what he can give to mankind; such that can make mankind appreciate Him enough and make heaven – food and raiment; be content. Paul tells us in Philippians 4 verse 12, “I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound  everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.” Here we learn how Paul conducted himself in every situation and was peaceful and okay.     **\n1  Renew your mind  To achieve this character we have to understand Romans 12 verse 2 and incorporate it, which says, “And be not conformed to this world  but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” Be not conformed to the pattern of the natural man; to the way the natural man thinks; the way the people of this world think, but be transformed by thinking in a new way. Whatever position God puts you remember the Almighty’s word says “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.” (Rom. 8 verse 28). If they do not work for your good it will work for the good of others through you; so, learn how to think thoughts that will keep you peaceful. Paul said, I am instructed (in whatever condition) ….”; he was not even married at all, yet it did not bother him, because there were some kinds of thoughts he thought of and they kept him. When he was among married people it did not mean anything, not having a wife did not mean anything to him. As he was going about in his ministry others went with their wives, and that did not affect Paul because he knew how to think. His mind was being renewed after the knowledge of God. Renew your mind woman; learn to think like Paul thought, such that nothing negative will affect you. Renew your mind Oh Man, learn to think scriptural thoughts that will keep you free.      **\nYou may say, ‘I am ashamed’. The shame of your life is because you left the Bible, because the Bible says, whosoever believeth in the name of the Lord shall not be ashamed.” (Romans 10 verse 11 paraphrased). You are ashamed because you do not have a child? You have left the scripture. Your thoughts are not in line with scripture. You are ashamed because all your children are females, you have left the scripture. Philip the Evangelist’s righteous family is penned down in scripture, and he had four daughters. You are not thinking well that is why you say you are ashamed. You say ‘they are criticizing me’; you have not understood how to handle all those criticism. Paul said, ‘I am instructed how to handle them’. If somebody comes and look down on you and even speak some foolish words, don’t you have shock absorber? There are scriptural shock absorbers. When a man came and cursed David, what did David say? He said ‘let him alone, let him curse, God knows my innocence. Who knows if by his cursing and my being patient the Lord will reward me by causing me to be delivered from this my situation?’ (second Samuel 16 verse 5 to 13). These are thoughts that are shock absorbers; absorbing shocks and that is what you need. “….in all things I have learnt”. Paul said, I have learnt it, you too go and learn it from today, go and practice it, go and find it out.    **\nIs any man glorying because he has great children? Haman gloried and all his children were hung in one day after he died. What is your problem? What is your trouble? Did God reject you? Did God deny you ministry? Did God deny you anointing? Did God deny your name being written in the book of life? Then what are you looking for? You went off in your own way.    **\n“…..Give me children, or else I die” (Genesis 30 verse 1), Rachel got the children and died; of what benefit were they to her? Be careful. This means you must learn to be a master over fear, shame, timidity, inferiority complex, etc. It is you that carry this child issue on your head such that when you are in the midst of other people, you are so bothered while they do not bother. If you can change your thoughts you will be free; nobody is pursuing you. Nobody disdains you woman, the glory of the Lord is upon you.  **\nNobody disdains you man, the glory of the Lord is upon you. The \nBible, talking about Jesus’s generation, said, “….There is nothing to be said about His generation….” (Acts 8 verse 33 paraphrased). That is, He did not marry nor gave birth, yet He is the person with the greatest glory upon the earth. The glory comes from heaven. Seek the glory that comes from heaven and when it comes from heaven upon you, every person’s eye would see what really matters. The glory of the Lord is upon you, the grace of the Lord is upon you, the name of the Lord is upon you and God have set an open door before you, why then are you allowing Satan to trouble you? Reject it, resist it.   **\nPaul said in Acts 20 verse 24 “But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.” Please do not allow anything of this earth, what you have and what you do not have, move you. You have a ministry, finish that ministry. The ministry is the gospel of Christ, preach it. Paul told the \nGalatians Christians in Galatians 4 verse 13 to 15, he said, “ Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. 14. And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. 15… for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.” The people you are preaching to do not mind about your infirmity rather they are seeing the brightest side and it is that side that attracts them. They do not mind your infirmity because you have something precious that does not pass away; that is the pearl of great price which everybody wants to obtain. Therefore change your mind-set and do not be moved by criticism, even by those Satan sends on your way, for example Peninnah to Hannah in First Samuel 1 verse 6 to 7,  “And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.  And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.”  Let none of these move you like apostle Paul, “But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.”   **\n1  Go to God in prayers - He answers prayers  Where child bearing is delayed or blocked, the couple should pray and persevere before God for His blessing in this regard. For whichever reason that childbearing is delayed or blocked, let the couple go before God. The husband or the wife may go before God alone in prayer and our God answers prayer.   **\nGenesis 25 verse 20 to 21   **\n“And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. \nAnd Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren  and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.”     **\nCan you see that? Go before the Lord, spend time with Him, talk to Him, and pray to Him. Two are better than one, spend time, the two of you and pray. You could seek prayer if the Lord directs you so. Do not jump up and down, running up and down seeking prayers and allowing false hands upon you, ruining your life, because you are looking for children. It is only if the Lord directs you to, otherwise you and God are ok. Pray, the Lord will answer. Prayer will solve the problem.    **\nFirst Samuel 1 verse 2, 5, 9 to 20.     **\n“ And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah  and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. \nBut unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah but the LORD had shut up her womb. \nAnd her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb. \nSo Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD. \nAnd she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore. \nAnd she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. \nAnd it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. \nNow Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard  therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. \nAnd Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. \nAnd Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit  I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. \nCount not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial,  for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. \nThen Eli answered and said, Go in peace  and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. \nAnd she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. \nAnd they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her. \nWherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his \nname Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.”     **\n \nThe same words ‘he knew’, as used of Adam with his wife, was also used here i.e. he had intercourse with his wife. The method is not told to us. All the revelations that are coming to you, saying Jesus took somebody to hell, that if the woman is on top of the man, during sexual intercourse, it is a sin. Where did they get that from? The scripture does not tell us that. It is not in the scripture. The God of heaven is a God of variety and variety is the pleasure of life. He gave us various foods. Where did you get that from? I told you strong meat is not for those that use milk. Check up all these people that say they went to heaven, some of the testimonies are direct fabrication from the devil, while others are from immature minds that do not know the scripture. And now some women say I cannot be on top of my husband again; they even quote scripture that Adam knew his wife. Do they understand what they are saying? Which method did Adam use? The method is not specified in scripture. Any method that gives you pleasure and satisfaction, as long as it is not abused nor misused, is acceptable by God. Put those dreams away so that they do not affect the things God gave you in the family. Satan is at work with those things. Some even said that Jesus took them to hell and all those using tie will go to hell. What is wrong with ties? They say it resembles snakes. So what about snakes, are they not part of the animals that God created? Do you not get some advantages from snakes? They help in swallowing some animals like frogs, rodents, etc. to reduce their number. There is nothing that is in this world that is not serving man. Everything is serving our purpose; God created them for us and said we should rule over them. So please do not listen to those things. Maybe you have already stopped having full pleasure with your husband because somebody who does not know the Bible or who framed that he went to hell said it. Were you there? Did you see him there?  The scripture is the sure word of prophecy. Discard anything contrary to the scripture. Elkanah knew his wife and she conceived by prayer. Take your case to God in prayer, he will answer you.     **\n First Samuel 1 verse 25 to 27     **\n“And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. \nAnd she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. \nFor this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him.”     **\n  \nFor Zachariah and Elizabeth they prayed but God’s answer to their petition took time to come. Abraham prayed, but, with all the promises God made to him, it was not until the childlessness reached twenty-five years before the promised child came, God was quiet. God has His dealings with you brother, please do not allow Satan to use you to affect it. Do not allow your mouth to destroy it or you will be blocking your name from the book of life. There are things that are mysterious that you cannot explain.    **\nBe quiet, just pray along with him and say, ‘thy will O God be done’. Paul had a mysterious ministry; people cried, did everything to prevent him he said, ‘why are you trying to break my heart? If you break this heart you will pay for it and you will pay with your life. Did you not hear God say, I will show him how much he shall suffer for my name sake? What is waiting for me in Jerusalem, is it not a suffering? God said bonds and affliction awaits me and the Lord says I am for it; I am going to Jerusalem’. (Acts 21 verse 11 to 14 paraphrased). Paul had a special ministry. So, do not use your tongue to try to speak things that are higher than you. Be very careful. Why will you do hurt to yourself? If you have compassion let it be between you and God; it is not for you to scatter things with your tongue, such that those who do not know the mind of God will be stumbling because of you.    **\n3  Seek medical advice/attention from gynaecologists and other fertility specialists  Sometimes medical advice needs to be sought. Both the man and woman need to be jointly involved in prayers and in receiving medical attention. Delay in child bearing may be from the woman or from the man or from both of them and the sick needs a physician. Physicians are a blessing of God.  The medical science is as beautiful as the telecommunication science. It is as beautiful as any other science that brings out things that improve society, that improves human living – use it! And do not give yourself to shame and pride. The sick needs a physician.    **\nNote, the following very important things   **\n1  Some cases of barrenness are in God’s full consent and control; they work out His glory. When the Lord was told that his friend Lazarus is sick, He delayed. Why did He delay? He said, “….This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God.…” (John 11 verse 4). They came across a blind man, born blind and his disciples asked, what caused this man to be born blind? Is it because of his sin, or that of his parents? Jesus said, “….neither his nor his parents’, but that the Lord should be glorified.” (John 9 verse 3). Now, look at the barrenness of Abraham with all the promises of God to him. Abraham was called the friend of God but this area was left fallowed. I tell you, the works of God on a man; it differs from one man to another. Some quickly went to school and graduated while some suffered to go to school and to graduate from school but they all serve the purpose. The Lord said, “There is a straight way I would have taken the children of Israel through from Egypt to the promise land but no, I am going to take them through the wilderness and I have reasons for it”. (Exodus 13 verse 17 to 18 paraphrased). Your own was straight but your brother’s own was not straight God has reasons for it. Who is at fault, your brother? No! Is it that he does not have faith? No! The God of faith is doing something in his life that is more than child bearing or just more than that thing (you may be looking for in his life). He wants to train you, He wants to know what is in you, He wants to manifest Himself gloriously in your later life; God has a plan for each man. See it in Isaac. See it also in Zachariah and Elizabeth who prayed and prayed. Jesus was to come into the world and He needed prayer warriors to pray Him in and so, God placed Zachariah in a condition that kept him or made him be in constant prayer until he had John the Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus. The Lord wanted to give a prophet to Israel, He wanted a child of faith and that is how Hannah, whose womb the Lord had shut up, built herself up. It was prayer that brought forth a child of promise. Leave God alone. Be peaceful in yourself, give glory to God, and give Him worship. Do not give shame to your brother. Do not cause your brother to be ashamed or put envy and jealousy in him. Don’t do that. Do not do it to your sister. God is doing something special which only He knows; that is one thing you should know. Accept the will of God for your life. Our major duty is to pray for and walk in God's will for our lives. Whatever His will is; either for you to have a natural child, to be a foster-parent, or go childless, accept it and commit to doing it gladly. God has a divine plan for each of His loved ones. God is the author of life. He allows conception and withholds conception. God is sovereign and possesses all wisdom and knowledge. “For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Jeremiah 29 verse 11. “Every good and perfect gift is from above. James 1 verse 17. Know and accept these truths.     **\n1 The number of children a couple should bear seems not to be the concern of God but His will in the life of that couple. The number of children you should have is not the main concern. What are the children doing? It is even getting more terrible now with the ungodliness in children. The number of children you should have is not really where the concern of God is. Some are praying ‘God give me twelve children’ and are more interested in raising a clan since many of their family members have died. What would happen after the clan is raised up? It will be to fight tribal war whenever anybody comes to take your land; the children can answer (stop) them at the gate, is that not so? The concern of God is not how many children you should have but His will in your life. That his will be done in your life. “Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven”. (Matthew 6 verse 9 to 10). Let the will of the Lord be done in your life. See Bible pattern  Abraham had one child with Sarah and six children with Keturah, but none of those six (with Keturah) matters in the plan of God. So, it is not the number of children but that which is the plan of God that matters. Give me excess, and God said, “but I have finished my plan so do not bother about those things. This one, in Isaac shall your name be called”. What is your problem? Isaac himself, who was a child of promise, in whom all the promises of God to Abraham will be fulfilled in his life, stayed childless for twenty years. As if to say, ‘God, what has happened? Is it not you who gave my father all those promises?’ And God said, “Yes I have my time, and I will do it in my time.” Giving birth to children is beautiful. I told you earlier, “Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them” but it does not mean every man’s quiver should be filled with them. How many times did Rebekah give birth? Just once; and with that she fulfilled the reason why she was created as a woman. Rebekah’s one time delivery was ok with God to serve the purpose of God to all generations. So, you should see it this way and get it right. How many children did Jephthah, that man that wrought great deliverance for Israel has? He had only one child and it was a girl. \nSo what is your problem?   **\n1  The sex of a child also does not matter. Some of you are worried about the sex of your children to the point of saying, ‘God my children are all girls, you must give me boys.’ There is no difference in the sight of God whether it is a woman or it is a man. If the rod of Moses did satisfy God how much more a human being? God can use whoever He wants, man or woman no difference. He is both the God of the man and the God of the woman. So, why are you troubled and saying, ‘I have only female children.’ Renew your mind, just as the Bible says, “Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.” Change the way you think. “Do not be conformed to this world”. (Romans 12 verse 2). Those things are of the world. You may claim that, ‘It is only through a man your name will be called’. Is it when you are in hell already, that they will be calling your name? Of what benefit will that be to you? Or when you are in heaven? Of what benefit will it be to you? We are talking of eternity you are busy talking about things of the earth. Let us follow our God and leave that business to the people of world and retrace Christianity, the path of God, the path of peace, the path of righteousness. “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8 verse 32). Even when the daughter of Jephthah was consecrated unto \nGod so that she did not marry, God did not say He will reward Jephthah with another child; the man did not have any other child again. The most important thing is for him to have been in heaven now and not children. Let the Lord reward him with heaven. The Lord knows if having a child or children will affect you, He knows if Satan will pass through them to corrupt the things committed into your hands by God. Is there no scale of preference? Would not the all wise God understand? Does not the prudent man foreseeth the evil and hides himself? (Proverbs 22 verse 3 and chapter 27 verse 12). So leave the matter with God, it is to the all wise God our saviour. So let us follow him and go with Him. Joseph had two children, why not more than two? His father had up to twelve but why were his two? Was it sickness, we do not know? Not necessarily sickness. We would be right if we say, it was rather the will of God. Moses also had two children. No more, what happened? God wanted it so. Did you hear about the children of Moses and what they did? Did you hear about the role they played in Israel? No! Ministers, work hard on your children because they are the interest of Satan. Samuel’s children did not follow his ways but were rather dishonest and perverted justice (First Samuel 8 verse 3). Work hard, Work hard on your children. And if the Lord did not give you many children do not look for more, “Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.” (Matthew 6 verse 34) \nBe peaceful, be very peaceful. That is what the word of God is telling us. Zachariah and Elizabeth, after a long time of barrenness, only gave birth to a child. And they did not cry for another one. You have two already you are saying, ‘pastor pray for me, since ten years that my wife gave birth to the last one we have not had another one’. Zachariah and Elizabeth had one and were satisfied. Don’t you have passion for the work of God? The fasting you should have been doing for the revival of the world you are doing it for more children. You may claim that demons are the ones responsible for your not bearing more children; take the scriptural part for your peace because Satan has cheated so many people in this area. Many families are restless, many women are restless because there is lack of contentment. You already have a child you still say ‘no, no, no I must have another’, you have only boys and you say, ‘I need a girl’, or you have only girls and you say, ‘I need a boy’, or ‘I need another’. That is restlessness and Satan will take advantage of you. Know the truth and let the truth give you peace, let the truth give you victory, let the truth give you rest. Yes, that is what we want you to know and understand. Zachariah and Elizabeth gave birth to only one, John the Baptist, and no other. Although Jacob had multitude of children why? It pleased God. See how they became the twelve tribes of Israel. In everything there is a divine hand working. You think God is careless? God is not careless; everything is well designed. It is the divine hand. Paul the apostle, and may be Barnabas too, and other apostles as Apostle John did not even marry and they appreciated their condition which made them have the better opportunity to labour for Jesus. Didn’t you hear   **\nPaul said, “He that is unmarried careth for the things of the \nLord?” \t(First Corinthians 7 verse 32). The Lord, who knew the apostleship He gave to Paul, knew that both a wife and children may inhibit that work. God said, “Paul you can stand, my grace is sufficient for you”. The Lord can take such decision, stay with Him and be satisfied with Him.    **\n \nThis exposition is essential to help some of us who have one child or two or none at all to learn contentment in this life and see those Bible days repeated in our lives. The greatest thing we should desire on earth is to labour fervently for God on earth and to make it to heaven. That is the best thing we should have in this life. Do not allow children issue to turn you away from God or make you fight at home, grudge or envy others, there is no shame to you in Christ. You might be thinking of what other women would say; there is no shame to those who are in Christ Jesus. “For whosoever believeth in the name of Lord shall not be ashamed.” (Romans 10 verse 11 paraphrased). Which shame are you talking about, glory is upon you. The glory of the Lord is upon you; there is no shame.      **\nIsaiah 54 verse 1 to 4     **\n“Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child  for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD. \nEnlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations, spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes; \nFor thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited. \nFear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed, neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame  for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.”      **\n\nThat is God. The spiritual breakthrough you are going to have in this life will make you become a glorious man or woman. There shall be no shame in your record; no shame in your family. There shall be no shame but glory attach to your name. God says, I will give the Eunuch a name better than the man that has children. Isaiah56 verse 5 paraphrased. That is God follow Him.     **\n          \t \t \nChapter Four Adoption of Children   **\n \nWhat is adoption?     **\nAdoption means to accept or claim ownership or parenthood of a child that is not directly your biological child and make the child enjoy the benefit of parenthood throughout his life. He is your child and heir as any of your children.    **\n \nWhat does the Bible say about adoption?     **\nRomans 8 verse 15-17    **\n“For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. \nThe Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God, \nAnd if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.”     **\nEphesians 1 verse 5    **\n“Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,”    **\nAdoption is good and acceptable in the sight of God. We were not children of God but He made us to become part of His family, not through the natural process of human conception, but through adoption. We were not children, God adopted us. God’s only begotten son is Jesus Christ; flesh of His flesh, bone of His bone, one with Him, is Jesus. But because we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour, God is now pleased with us to make us become children and now we are God’s children “But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.” (John 1 verse 12). What we received is salvation, forgiveness of sin, regeneration, reconciliation, and adoption, all these things are the same. We were not children but God has made us children and Jesus is not ashamed to call us his brethren. We were not Jesus’ brothers (brethren) before, it is adoption that gave us that right. And God has put His Spirit in us, the same Spirit that was in Christ is now in us, making us one and that Spirit is called the Spirit of sonship, that cry within us and tells us we have a Father; we call Him Abba Father; that is adoption.      **\nGod called the nation Israel his son, whom he loved Hosea 11 verse 1. He told Pharaoh, Israel is my son, even my firstborn Exodus 4 verse 22. He said of Solomon, David's son, \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son. Second  Samuel 7 verse 14. God himself determined the adoption of believers as children of God. “ According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love   Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will” (Ephesians 1 verse 4 to 5). This adoption is not the result of any work or merit of the believer, but solely on God's love and grace. Bringing a person into a family by means of adoption is done by choice and out of love. Ephesians 1 verse 5 New Living Translation, puts it this way, “God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. It gave God great pleasure to adopt us as children.    **\n Matthew 1 verse 18 to 25     **\n“Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise, When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.     **\nThen Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. \nBut while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife,  for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. \nAnd she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS  for he shall save his people from their sins. \nNow all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, \nBehold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. \nThen Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife  \nAnd knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son  and he called his name JESUS.”    **\nOur Lord Jesus was adopted and raised by Joseph, his mother’s husband, who took him as his own child. God chose His Son to be adopted. If adoption was good enough for the Son of God, then it is a blessing for His people. Moses, a great prophet of God, who God used to bring out/deliver his people from Egypt/slavery, was adopted and brought up by Pharaoh’s daughter, who took him as her son and named him Moses Exodus 2 verse1 to10. Samuel, another great prophet of God, who judged and led God’s people to worship Him, was fostered by Eli (first  Samuel 1 verse 20 to 28). God used Esther to deliver his people; she was also adopted by her uncle Mordecai. Clearly, we can see that adoption is good and acceptable in the sight of God. It is absolutely biblical.    **\nAdoption can also be called engraftation as seen in Romans 11 verse 17. \n“And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree”.     **\n\nThe olive tree had branches, but a chance was created in the tree either by cutting off a branch or a part of the trunk and another was fixed there; it was not part of it before but now it has become part of it and partakes of the root, the origin and enjoys like any other branch; that is adoption. The child adopted into the family has the same right as any other child in the family and claims the same generation as any other one to the root. This is a privilege and it is a blessing.    **\n  \nReasons why adoption is a blessed practice     **\n1  It is a biblical principle by which we become children of God Ephesians 1 verse5. \n2  It is one of the ways God fulfils His promises of giving children to the barren.   ** \nPsalms 113 verse 9.     **\n“He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful \nmother of children. Praise ye the Lord.”     **\nIt is the choice of God which one to use. They say ‘your womb has been removed; your womb has been blocked and that is why you cannot give birth to a child’. The Lord decides to answer through another way. To let you know that, it is a lie of the devil that says you cannot be a mother of children. God has given you a child; it is an adopted child but that is a child; having right in your life, having right before God as any of your natural child. Maybe you have other children and are looking for a female or a male child, and the Lord passed through this other way to answer your prayer; the child comes in adopted but has the same right as other children in the house. Your other children may not even be aware of it. It is fulfilling God’s promises in your life. Therefore if God will use this way to fulfil His promise, do not be too big for it. Else, it is your ignorance and pride that is at work and “pride goes before a fall.” It maybe that you have not known the word of God to this point, that God can use this method. The Holy Spirit may have been prompting your heart to go in that method and you say no, ‘I must wait until it is my own’. Whether your own or whichever one, they are from God. God is the father of children; He is the one that gives children, hear Him.     **\n3  It is part of the ways God shows compassion to the fatherless on earth. Otherwise how do you think it will be to some people; some people are born with great disadvantage.     **\nEzekiel 16 verse 3 to 6    **\n“And say, Thus saith the Lord God unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite. \nAnd as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all. \nNone eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, that is what heartless women, prostitutes do to some of those children, to the lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born. \nAnd when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.”     **\n\nThey were casted out to die but God did not allow them to die; He caused them to be picked and handed over to a family, “When my father and mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up”. Psalms 27 verse 10. Adoption fulfils this, otherwise those children will just perish. Do you know what they will become for God? Are they not human beings as you and I? Adoption of children is the will of God. If He tells you to, if it is in your heart, to solve this problem, so that children that has been abandoned by wicked parents should be delivered and have a home, do it and then they will praise God in that day. When we get to heaven, people will have many reasons to praise the Lord. These adopted children will have a reason to praise God. So what are you resisting the way of God for? Others even try to use the bible to resist adoption as if God will go against himself in his word.    **\n4  It is a soul winning strategy when the adopting parents are believers. A soul winning strategy because this child now has the privilege to know Jesus. The child may be from a pagan family or from the family of another religion but the precious grace of God brought him or her into your hands, so that he too can taste eternal life by your work because you will evangelize. The devil is out to destroy those souls in the western and the developed countries; Christian orphanages are closing down there because the homosexuals and lesbians are adopting children and are strongly backed up by their government. What do you think the future of those children will be? If that is, even, all the soul you can take to God, then you will not go to heaven empty handed. I think in some western countries, when a person has finished giving birth to children, the children would leave to go to school or be on their own. The parents would be left alone, so they would go and adopt another child. It becomes a blessing; it is soul winning.    **\n1  Adoption also fulfils the definition of true religion. James 1 verse \n27 \"Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this  to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world. “Visit\" here is much deeper and more active than the English would suggest. It means to look after, have a care for, provide for, furnish with necessary things.  **  \n2  Adoption is, for some, a calling to multiply their impact as parents by expanding their family with children who are not their own, biologically.    **\n3  It is victory in spiritual warfare against the devil, whose aim is to steal, kill and destroy the soul. Satan had meant to destroy a soul, to destroy people who are childless by making them restless or making them peaceless, but the Lord has made them joyful parents of a child or children. Satan is defeated, that restlessness and weeping has stopped. Now a child is crying in the family, now a child is in her hand, she is now a mother of children. The matter has finished, the battle has been rounded up and Satan has nothing to say anymore, he has gone. This is the work of God.   **\n4  It is a blessing to the marriage when God gives this privilege to a married couple with or without children. If God gives you this assignment, because children are the blessing of the Lord, do not say I have children already, please take it and do it for God. Remember Moses was an adopted child. Supposed the principle of adoption was rejected, a great person in this world, one of the heroes of this world, would have been lost. Remember Esther also was adopted by Mordecai and she became the deliverer of both Mordecai’s life and the whole nation. Why are you refusing an adopted child? Do you know the blessing he/she will bring to you and to the nation?   **  \n \nMethods of adoption    **\nThe methods of adoption may differ in different countries or states. It is not without labour! It takes nine months for a woman to bring a baby into the world. So adopters should be ready to go through the necessary procedures or fulfil the necessary conditions to adopt a baby. The prospective adoptive parent/parents should go to the relevant authorities in their countries for further information, for example, in Nigeria, the \nMinistry of Youth and Sports are the ones in charge of adoption. \nThe method of securing the child must be devoid of lie, treachery and evil. The adopted child must receive maximum security and privacy, not to be exposed to ridicule, shame or ill treatment. Remember, bringing a person into a family by means of adoption is done by choice and out of love. “God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure. (Ephesians 1 verse 5).     **\nAdoption is an act of love. It must come from a desire to love a child. It must be motivated by our love for God. It must be because we want to raise a child for God as a demonstration of our love for God. Every child is a gift from God. Every child is an object of our love for God and for humanity. So if you want to adopt a child, then be ready to love the child for the rest of your days. Be ready to be accountable for the success of that child. Be ready to be a good steward of the gift. Every child is a gift to humanity and if nourished properly will enhance the human race.   ** \nWhile different couples/families may have their own reason or motivation to explore adoption, the core of the desire for a family to adopt and what propels that family forward to completing an adoption, should be based on the following     **\n1  The desire to give a child a family – The prospective adoptive family wants to provide a child with a loving home and family. This includes everything that makes a home a loving place to be and a family that is an accepting group. It means accepting the child for who he is - even their faults. Understanding that the child has a history and heritage that also needs to be respected and embraced.   **\n2  The desire to help a child move on in life. – The adoptive parents have an interest in helping a child heal from past grief and pain, whether this comes from abuse, neglect, being abandoned, or orphaned. The adoptive family wants to help the child start a new life and knows that there will be ups and downs with adoptive parenting and is prepared for these challenges.    **\n3  The ability to provide for another child in all ways – The prospective adoptive parent wants to share their home with a child and have the physical space for another child. They also have the time and the emotional space in their heart for a new family member. The adoptive family should also be financially secured enough to adopt comfortably.     **\n4  The entire adoptive family agrees to the adoption – Both the husband and the wife must agree on this matter. In a case where the adopted child will be an additional child, then, everyone in the family must be informed and agree that adding to the home through adoption is the right thing to do. All the children in the home should be excited about adopting. Some black couple adopt a white child and vice versa so the entire family should agree to the adoption. However, when the adopted child is the first, the siblings need not know. Every secrecy must be kept as he/she is growing up so that people will not abuse him/her especially in our African society. Do not allow that. Your children should not know anything about it except if by no means they come to know otherwise there is no need of any knowledge of the children. Do not allow your extended family to abuse the child. It is your privacy and that is how it should be.     **\n1  The adoptive family knows a child in need of a family – The prospective adoptive family is aware of a child who needs an adoptive home. The child may be a family friend, a relative, or a child they met at church or within the neighbourhood. \nIn conclusion, if adoption was good enough for the Son of God, then it is a blessing for His people.     **\n \nChapter Five  Family Planning    **\n \nColossians 3 verse 15 to 16.   **\n“And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful. \nLet the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.”  \nLet the word of Christ dwell in you richly.” It is as the word is rich that the wisdom of it will appear. The quantity and richness of the word produces wisdom. That is the word of God.    **\nThe Importance and Necessity of Family Planning  \nThough God desires us to bear children, He expects us to exercise wisdom in this regard. Why? Wisdom is the principal thing. See it in Proverbs 4 verse 5 to 9  \n“Get wisdom, get understanding,  forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. \nForsake her not, and she shall preserve thee  love her, and she shall keep thee. \nWisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom  and with all thy getting get understanding. \nExalt her, and she shall promote thee, she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. \nShe shall give to thine head an ornament of grace  a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.”    **\nApply wisdom in life, you will have the benefits of this life if you do. God wants you to have children yet He wants you to be wise. Children, to the parent, are as good as honey. It rejoices the heart, the person is happy to say, ‘I have gotten children or these are my children’. They are good and makes one happy. What says the Bible to such good thing as honey? Proverbs 24 verse 13 to 14, “13. My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste.” Has God given you chance to bear children? Fine, give birth to children. You have had first two already? That is good, we thank God. You are expecting the third one? Beautiful, “my son eat thou honey for honey is good.” Give birth to children; that is good. “14. So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul  when thou hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shall not be cut off.” Blessings come from children; blessings come from honey. But it is not only that portion the Bible has something to say as regards honey. Proverbs 25 16. “Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.” The same scripture that says, eat honey, honey is good tells you if you do not control the quantity of the sweet honey you take, you will come to hate every drop of it in your stomach. If you do not control the quantity you eat you will hate the whole thing. Who likes seeing his vomit? If you do not control the number of children you are bearing you will come to hate the fact that you gave birth to anyone. As good as they are, ‘they make me happy, I am proud of them,’ you say, control the number of children you bear. Look at it again in Proverbs 25 verbs 27, “It is not good to eat much honey  so for men to search their own glory is not glory.” It is very clear that “It is not good” considering these our days. In those days, when they were given to farming, it was good for your quiver to be filled with children because they will go to the farm. Then, one man could have a very large farm because he has children that will work with him in the farm, but these days food is bought with money and every person eats very big and children eat in a way that surprises one. Whatever has happened to their stomach? It is probably enlarged. If you do not control how many children you have, your life will be in confusion. What about the school fees, which one do you send to school and which will you not send? You want to be partial? If not, then how do you get the money to pay everyone’s school fee? “Let the word of God dwell in you richly in all wisdom.” “Wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom.” How do you pay the school fees? What about sicknesses, when you will need to treat them? Eventually you are so drained that your Christian life is affected and you miss it. So would you not be wise? Is there any commandment that tells you the number of children you must have? It is the same thing as telling a Christian woman and a Christian husband not to use this or that method in their love-making. No method is found to be forbidden in scripture known to us except these ones that are completely from vile minds, rather the scripture says enjoy pleasure with the wife of your youth. Enjoy pleasure whichever way but we have told you not to go off the natural use.    **\nThe Lord did not tell you how many children you have. Why did Abraham not have more than the number of children he had? Why did Isaac not have more than two? Why did Joseph not have more than two? Why did Moses not have more than two? Why not? Have they sinned then? The control is in your hand according to your wisdom. If you use your wisdom well, you will go to heaven. We have just released a book titled ‘The Key of Your Life is in Your Hand’ ’. If you do not use your wisdom well, you will go to hell but use your wisdom well. As good as children are, not many have the resources to have plenty of them. It is advisable to have enough number that you can care for and still remain righteous and faithful before God. We must be wise and not fools given the days we are in. Ephesians 5 verse 15 to 17, 15 “See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is” in this matter. How many have been unfaithful to God now? How many have withdrawn from God now because of children? How many have been affected in various ways? What cry are you hearing now from parent both in Christ and outside Christ? What are you hearing of children in society? What do you hear happening to children in other developed nations? Be wise. Know and understand what the will of God is in your life at this moment. It is true wisdom then, to curtail the number of children you will bear. Why? “A prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself.” (Proverbs 22 verse 3). Having seen what some children are doing to their parents, one can decide not to have too many of them. In fact it will be reasonable for any minister to know that giving birth to too many children is not favourable for the Christian ministry. It is just natural for the Christian minister to know this. It is not favourable. If you have done it before, in your ignorance, plead on account of your ignorance to God. For why will you waste the whole of your life on earth, over a people you do not even know if they will go to heaven or not. Solomon in the Bible said that, one of the things that troubled him was that, when he considered all the riches he gathered and he will leave them to somebody that may be a fool; it troubled him. Then what is the need of even gathering these things when eventually a fool will take over. What am I wasting my time for? Solomon thought to himself. So it is wisdom to control child bearing.     **\nNow that it is clear that family planning/birth control is required, how can this be done? Some would say take it by faith and go before the Lord and pray saying, ‘God we are okay, stop it now.’ It does happen, God can stop it. But not everybody has such faith. Not many people can stop the sun from going down, so we will not direct everybody to that direction. It happens sparingly. It can happen here and there by faith, prayer can stop child bearing. But do not tell every man that is sick that he must pray on his sickness and never take drug “….all men have not faith”, (Second Thessalonians 3 verse 2), that is why God has provided medication. People who are unwise and foolish pray against medication. Why do they not pray against other scientific inventions that God has given to us? Why are they using the telephone? Why do they enter vehicle to travel? Why do they enter the plane? It is the same God that gave the knowledge. To one He gave the knowledge of the vehicles. To the other the knowledge of medicine. To the other the knowledge of foods and that is how the world has been moving. How will you now say you do not want medicine? It is essential, God gave them all as long as they are not meant to destroy.    **\n \nMethods of Family Planning     **\nMedical advice become important, “Without counsel purposes are disappointed  but in the multitude of counsellors, they are established”. Proverbs 15 verse 22. There are some methods people apply, some say they use withdrawal method so that the semen is not spilled inside the woman but outside and in that way, they are able to control situations but others contend against it and say it is unscriptural, that why must they do so. Why must they withdraw? \nThat in the Bible Onan was killed by the Lord because he spilled out side.    **\n\nGenesis 38 verse 8 to 9.     **\n“And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. \nAnd Onan knew that the seed should not be his; And Onan knew that the seed should not be his.”    **\nOnan died for his lack of love, he died because he did not love his neighbour, he did not obey his father, he did not love his brother; he was selfish. “And it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.” Can you see where the wickedness is; he was not killed because he spilled it outside but because he was wicked. Verse 10 says, “And the thing which he did displeased the Lord  wherefore he slew him also.” Now what he did was wickedness that is why the Lord slew him. Why did the Lord has slew his brother in verse 7 “And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him.” What caused all these slaying is wickedness, for refusing to do good to a fellow man, for hardening the heart. It is not that when your semen falls out you have sinned no, you have not sinned. If the method of withdrawal serves you that is okay, go ahead, that is not in wickedness. It is not wickedness against your wife, it is not wickedness against any other person. It is because you want to keep to the scriptural wisdom that advised you, in order to control the number of children you have, it is not a sin. But to do it in masturbation, in the pleasuring of yourself so that you can release, is a sin. Somebody came to confess his sin to me one time and said he masturbated with his wife. Then I asked, what does he mean, which way, how did it happen? Then he said the wife was in the hospital that day he was lying on the bed he was busy focusing on the wife in the hospital and he began to rub his body and then masturbated. I told him to leave his wife out of the matter, he has sinned. What was his aim? Pleasuring. He had to bring his mind to a state of pleasuring, him alone and that is defilement. We do not do it so why are you doing it? In that respect you are sinning. However, sometimes in a dream, some provoking dream can cause to you to release; you wake up and see yourself wet on your bed, that is not a sin because your will was not involved; you did not plan it neither did you think it, it could be natural or a satanic manipulation; as you stand up, cleanse yourself, pray against it, resist it; “Resist the devil and he will flee from you.” (James 4 verse 7).    **\nFamily planning is essential to control child bearing, the couple must seek medical advice. The method must not be the one that kills an already formed child. Whatever method you use, it should not be the one that makes you a murderer. Some use condom, it is ok if it satisfies you. In all, any method which is suitable to both the man and the woman and is not an offence against God, particularly not killing an already formed child, that is advised, that is clean, that is righteous, is accepted. You may say, ‘this method will affect me, it is risky, and it will do this and that’. Tell me the thing in life that is not risky, what is that thing in life that you do that lacks risk? Even drinking water is risky such that if you do not drink with care, it might go through the wrong way. Risk is part of life but we manage risk and move forward and we live. Therefore, use that method which is suitable to the woman but wisdom must come into it also. It is not wise for you to say, ‘let us go to remove the womb’. The woman is still young and in the events of life the husband may die and she may need to marry another man, so why are you removing the womb? Who has told the two of you that you will live together till old age? Take it to God in prayer he will guide you. The Lord wants your peace. \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

The salvation of others also lies in the truth of the scripture and in our hands. As we know this truth for our own salvation, we also know it for the salvation of others. \nMarriage is not a discovery of man, but an institution that God established by Himself on the earth. It was not discovered by any primitive or modern society but God instituted it. If God instituted marriage, as we so say, then the principles of operating it lie with Him. Everything concerning marriage we need to ask Him because He alone is the originator and the visioner of it. That is why we want to allow God speak to us naturally in His word on marriage. So, let God speak exactly what the marriage is all about.    **\n\nGenesis 2 verse 18 to 25   **\n“ And the Lord God said, It is  not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them  and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept  and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh  she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore, shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife  and they shall be one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.”     **\n\nMatthew 19 verse 3 to 11  **\n“The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause? And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery, and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery. His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry. But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.”   **\n  \nLet us look again at Genesis 2 verse 23 to 25 “And Adam said, this is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh ” You can see the oneness here. Adam, the first man, testified to the oneness between a man and his wife. Your great, great, great grandfather, Adam, the first man created, bore witness that a man is one with his wife. In fact the wife is part of the man. And the wife he was referring to here is the only woman available. So when Jesus talked against divorce, it was natural because it was not in the mind of God. He did not make provision for it. God did not make provision of another man for a married woman or another woman for a married man. Adam knew this. He said, “she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother-----”. This verse shows that marriage was instituted to be a world affair. It is a prophecy concerning marriage in the future, that there shall be men and women on earth and marriage shall take place among them. How will it be like? “----- a man shall leave his father and mother-----”. This also talks about maturity and separation. That means, when a man is mature to marry, he goes to get his own wife. The wife is not to remain in her father’s house – no; the wife is made for the man. It is the man who is to “leave his father and mother” (separation) to cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh.  **\nAnd so we see from the passage, ‘Leaving’ ‘Cleaving’ ‘One flesh.’ ‘Leaving’ means to leave father and mother so that you are not under their control. As a married man you are matured and have gotten independence from your father and mother. You are forming a nation of your own where you are president. ‘Leaving’ is essential. Many who did not leave after they got married but remained in the same house with their parents did not find peace. Why? It was because they did not leave. The word says, leave the control of your father and mother because the home where you are, already has a head and there cannot be two heads in the same home. Now, you have gotten an establishment in which you are supposed to be the head, but you cannot exercise your headship because you are where somebody already is the head, so there will be conflict. There will not be liberty and you will not be able to express your mind, your wife will not have real freedom because she is under somebody. She is to be an assistant head but there is already an assistant head before her, so she cannot perform her office. There will always be difficulty, problems, bitterness, anger, murmuring, insufficiency, trouble, fighting and quarrelling. When you find this going on, obey the scripture. For those who are yet to marry, fulfil this scripture when you marry. In case you are already married and still under the control of your parents, go and fulfil the scripture. Otherwise it will affect your Christian life, because the man who is your head (your father) may not be born again. Even if he is born again, the Lord did not say he should be your head in that respect. Go and find your home; that is ‘leaving.’ See Matthew 19 verse 4 to 7 again “And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother-----”. Note the emphasis, ‘leave.’ In case you and your wife are under your parents and having difficulties, remember the scripture, leave. It means there is a scripture you have not obeyed. Somebody once said, ‘In case your father is late and your mother is still alive and you are to stay with your mother because you are the one to care for her, I would suggest, that you still leave that house and carry your mother with you to another house which she did not contribute to build’. It is then you have defeated the matter completely. Otherwise the root is still there; she built that house, she was there before any woman entered that house and she is the head of any woman there, in fact, including any man there. So, this is wisdom, that you LEAVE.       **\nThere is ‘cleaving’; the husband and the wife coming together. This ‘cleaving’ speaks so much of the sexual intercourse that will be between the man and his wife. It talks about intimacy that realizes the ‘one flesh.’ We shall learn more as we go further. “Therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh. They were both naked, the man and his wife and were not ashamed.” This is still speaking about the ‘Oneness’. So you are not to be ashamed of your bodies; you are one.    **\n\nChapter two  No Provision for Divorce or Polygamy in Marriage.   **\n \nMatthew 19 verse 4 to 5    **\n“And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh?”   **\n‘Twain’ here talks about two not three. Polygamy is not possible because the ‘one flesh’ cannot be between one man and two or three women. and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh.” God is saying, they are no more two. You are the one seeing them as two. God no longer sees them as two, but one flesh. “What therefore God has joined together let not man put asunder.” This is absolutely God’s business. Marriage is absolutely God’s business. Therefore do not interfere with it; take it as He presents it. You are no more two that can be divided. You are separating and saying you will marry another; it is because you are thinking you are two. If marrying another were possible, then it is you and your wife that will marry another because you are one flesh. You know, it was Sarah and Abraham that married Hagar; maybe you are not aware of that. Hagar must never come in between those two because they are one. When trouble comes, it is Hagar that will have to leave; that is what it means. How much more now, marriage is not possible again with another; it is two that have become one. “What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.” If the court puts asunder, God will judge them. You may say it is the law of the government. Who gave the government? “The government shall be upon his shoulder”. So, the government of the world must not deviate from Him (the giver of government). If a Church puts asunder, God will judge the authority of that church because they have put asunder to what God did. It is God that joined them; the God of eternity did it. You may say that they were not born again when they were joined. Abraham and Sarah were never born again when they married, but God joined them and the world today is blessed through Abraham and Sarah; that is the wisdom of God.    **\nYou may say, ‘my wife is a terrible wicked woman’. The God who saw her wickedness and allowed her to be joined to you, although you may have made a mistake, the God who is able to change mistakes to good, joined you and that wicked woman, because He sees the future. He is a God of eternity. He sees beyond you to your children and to your children’s children. He knows the influence you will make in His world, for He made all things for himself. Therefore do not tamper with that marriage; it is absolutely God’s business. That is what the Lord is saying here, Matthew 19 verse 7 to 8, “They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives  but from the beginning it was not so.” Even when Eve committed the worst sin in the world (I call it so), by bringing damnation to the human race, Adam did not put her away, because, “-----from the beginning it was not so”. So, there is no sin that your wife or your husband can commit now, no matter what, that can implicate the whole world because there is no man or woman that can commit a sin that will bring the same curse upon the world as Eve. Yet Adam did not put her away, so there is no sin your wife will commit that should make you divorce her. There is none. Some people say, ‘adultery or unchastity can cause divorce’. Jesus said something here, and I paraphrase, “When you talk about Moses, you are talking about the law. The law permitted divorce because of the hardness of your hearts, you are stiff-necked people and God was still training you, but now I, Jesus Christ, have come to fulfil the law and have brought perfection, to return things to their original standard because there is not going to be another dispensation, no other saviour is coming, no other authority is coming, and now the word of God has come to put all things in standard, and in that standard there is no provision for divorce”  ‘But what about adultery?’, you may ask. They brought a woman caught in adultery to Jesus and said ‘we caught this woman in the very act of adultery and Moses said we should stone such a one to death’. Jesus answered them and said, “He that his without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her”’. Everybody escaped - drunkards, liars, thieves, angry people, witches and wizards; all escaped. What was Jesus communicating? Jesus was saying that adultery and other sins are the same. Just as anger cannot cause divorce, adultery cannot; as telling lies cannot cause divorce, adultery cannot; as witchcraft (i.e. a witch who gives birth to a child and eats up the child) cannot cause divorce, adultery cannot. You cannot divorce your husband because he is committing adultery or has married a second wife. Although it is a sin, it cannot cause divorce because Jesus has returned things back to their original standard. He was the one that made them from the beginning. Some may say, ‘if it is so then, it is better not to marry because marriage is tough and women are troublesome; if we cannot be changing them as we want, then it is better not to marry.’ To this, Jesus said in Matthew 19 verse 11, “All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.” Not all men will take this. It is for holy people, who are committed to God, and His righteousness. These are the ones that will take this; others cannot. Romans 8 verse 7 to 8, “For the carnal mind is enmity against God  for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God”. The carnal man cannot obey the law of God. Why? He just cannot, so it is not for everybody; it is not. Jesus said it. If you now fail, Jesus has already said that it is not for everybody. So, it means that if you fail in this matter, you fail after the common man in the world, after the manner of sinful men in the world. Jesus has already said, it is not all the people that will obey this injunction, just as it is not everybody that will go to heaven. The choice is yours to obey this, or to find an excuse to reject it, the choice is yours. You may say, ‘No! No! That is my opinion’. Stay with your opinion. Other people too have their own opinions, but there is only one opinion, for Jesus is the only way.    **\nIt is His opinion that is the correct one, which is the scripture. I therefore counsel you, obey the scripture and live.  **\n \nIf you check it from Adam to Moses, marriage depicted one man one woman clearly. It is the union of one man and one woman, no divorce, remarriage or polygamy. Look backward, Adam and Eve did not divorce until they died, check it. Check it up again, when a story was told of one of the sons of Cain who married a second wife, the Bible mentioned it because it was not common. And that man was the next murderer to Cain. He was a kind of unique, stubborn, sinful man; real peculiar one, that could marry a second wife such that the bible recorded it. Marriage to a second wife was not common even among the sinners of the old time. One man, one woman was their principle. See Abraham; it was one wife, one husband. He was married to Sarah, who was barren for ten years, but it did not tamper with their marriage. Barrenness did not affect marriage between Abraham and Sarah, even when they were unbelievers, so their marriage was not disturbed by barrenness. Abraham only remarried after Sarah died.  \nJacob’s marriage to two wives was a manipulation. It was not his plan; he was deceived. It was not so in the beginning. Everybody stuck to his wife. Isaac’s marriage with Rebekah, was twenty years in barrenness, yet he did not marry another woman. No! With all the promises of God that said (paraphrased), “through you I will multiply the earth, I will fulfil the promise of Abraham in your life, your descendants shall be as stars of heaven and as sand in the seashore”, twenty years of barrenness did not shake that man to labour to fulfil God’s promise by his power. He felt, ‘If God made that promise let him fulfil it’. He prayed to God and it happened. Re-marriage or polygamy was not common. Check it also with Joseph. Joseph in Egypt, married the daughter of Potipherah, the priest of On. When his brethren joined him with their women, he did not change his woman and say ‘ok let me now marry a woman from my tribe’. He was already married to a woman. Your tribe or not, it must be one wife. Don’t even bring tribe into it. From the beginning this has been there. Check it up with Moses. Moses married in Midian and his wife was completely ignorant of the customs, lifestyle and traditions of the Jew when she was brought to join him. Couldn’t Moses, a great man, have taken a Jewess for a wife? Couldn’t he have said, ‘I want a wife that knows the customs of my people?’ Moses did not do it. Even when Miriam and Aaron complained, he did not change that woman for another.   **\nWe are going back to the beginning. Please, go and preach this truth to the people. The Lord has decided to use us to recover the church and this is a message of recovery. See Matthew 19 verse 8\n “He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so.” Jesus came and said ‘back to the beginning’ and that is where we are now. Let us go and preach it everywhere.   **\nThe New Testament shows clearly the restoration of marriage to the original state as it was in the beginning, “one wife for one man”.    **\nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 1 to 3   **\n“Concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me, it is good for a man not to touch a woman. Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her \nown husband.”   **\nIf we should say, let every man stand by his own wife and let every woman stand by her own husband, what are you expecting to see? One man one woman. You will neither see two men standing by a woman nor two women standing by a man. If we should find more than one woman standing by a man, we would come back to them and say ‘you have not fulfilled this instruction, let each one of you stand by her husband’. There must be separation between those two women. One must go and look for another man. That is what it means; that is the scripture. “Let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband”. Marriage to two wives is outside the will of God. They are sinners that do that, because, “He that made them from the beginning, made them male and female”. Not a male and two females or many females. No! He made them male and female and this stands till today. That is the standard in the New Testament. There is no divorce or polygamy as we have been told by the word of God. Let us be obedient to the word of God for obedience brings blessing.    **\n \nThe Sin of Fornication and Adultery in Marriage  **\nMatthew 19 verse 9  \t  ** \t \t \t \n“And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery, and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.”    **\nJesus said, if any man puts away his wife except it be for fornication he commits adultery. Whosoever marries that woman, which has been put away by her husband, also commits adultery. Fornication is a sin committed by somebody that is not/has never married, while adultery is a sin committed by somebody who is married.  **\n\nDeuteronomy 22 verse 22   **\n“If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman, so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.”    **\nThat is adultery; a man found lying with a married woman. Adultery has been committed and the two of them should be killed so that evil will be put away from Israel. This tells you that, if a sin is done in the Church and that sin is not properly judged, evil is among you in that Church. Judge the sin properly; it is then the matter is concluded and you have put away sin from that Church. If you play with sin  maybe someone committed sin and you are playing with him or her, and just leave the matter, the whole Church is defiled.   **\nDeuteronomy 22 verse 23 to 24    **\n“If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife  so thou shalt put away evil from among you.”    **\n\nCan you see, they are still in betrothal relationship? But the bond between her and the husband she is betrothed to is very strong to the point that they call her the wife of the man, but they are still in betrothal relationship. So, this is the fornication the Bible is talking about, that “if any man puts away his wife except it be for fornication, You were in this betrothal relationship but before you came together, someone has committed immorality with her, it is called fornication because she has not yet married; this is the only acceptable exception for putting her away.  **\nDeuteronomy 22 verse 25 to 27  **\n“But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her, then the man only that lay with her shall die. But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death  for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter, For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, \nand there was none to save her.”     **\nThere was no consent. Let us pick a little knowledge from there; Matthew 1 verse 20   \n\n“Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife ”\n although she is with pregnancy, there is no sin in her with regards to immorality, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.” But for the damsel (in Deuteronomy 22 verse 25 to 27), a physical union took place between her and another man but she cried and called for help and there was nobody to rescue her, so, the man overpowered her. That is armed robbery; a rape. She did not give her consent. The man overpowered her and so she has not sinned. When a man and a woman are betrothed and have not yet come together (i.e. live together and consummate their marriage sexually) and the lady is seen in sin of immorality, that is fornication, but when they have come together (i.e. married) and the lady is seen in sin of immorality, then it is no more fornication, but adultery. It is fornication that results in dissolution of betrothal relationship, but adultery, like any other sin in marriage, does not cause divorce.     **\n \nChapter Three  The Bible’s Stand on Forgiveness and Separation in Marriage.    **\n \nForgiveness in Marriage    **\nAdultery does not separate marriage, because Jesus said, it is equal to any other sin. In the early time, it could cause the woman to die completely. But now, it is not so. Why? All the sins are the same, they take people to hell. Why does adultery not separate marriage? Let us look at \nMatthew 18 verse 21 to 35    **\n“Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven. Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence  and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. And he would not  but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me, Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee? And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses.”    **\nWhat is the Lord saying? The sin of immorality of that your marriage partner, your husband or your wife, against you, is very insignificant compared to your sin against God. Picture it this way; your sin against God is as big as a whole country while your husband’s/wife’s sin is as a district in that country. If God forgave you all your sins, what sin has your husband or wife committed against you that you cannot forgive? You may say, ‘it is adultery, immorality, how can I forgive? She embarrassed me’. Do you know the embarrassment you have caused God by uniting with Satan, His enemy, to cause great wickedness in this life and yet God forgave you? What embarrassment has your wife brought upon you that you cannot forgive her? What embarrassment has your husband brought upon you that you cannot forgive him? Is it enough to divorce her or divorce him and cast her into prison? Then, the forgiveness you received from God has been cancelled.    **\nThat is what it means; that you are not worthy of God’s forgiveness. Didn’t the Bible tell you, “when you stand praying, forgive”? “If you forgive not others their trespasses, neither will your father forgive you.” Now that you have refused to forgive the sin of your wife or your husband which you call adultery, which the Lord has told you is not different from any other sin and you have divorced because of it, do not think of heaven again, your heaven is CANCELLED. The Lord said to that servant “I forgave you ten thousand talents and you cannot forgive one hundred pence?” Naaman gave two talents to Gehazi and bound them upon two men; telling you the weight of a talent. Just two talents needed two people, then, how many people would carry ten thousand talents? It means you will need ten thousand people to carry ten thousand talents. And it was forgiven you. But then, for these hundred pence that will not fill your pocket, you want to kill somebody; you want to divorce a woman and cause her to suffer, in this world where demons are. You are sending your wife out in the darkness of night and you say, ‘she sinned’. You abandoned that man to the wickedness of this life and say, ‘it is because he sinned’. The Bible says, “Forgive one another even as God for Christ’s sake forgave you”. And if forgiveness is truly there, divorce is cancelled. That is what the word of God is telling us. Take it very seriously, handle it well, and do not play with it. No divorce; marriage is binding for life.  **\nRomans 7 verse 2 to 3    **\n“For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress, but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be \nmarried to another man.”     **\nAs it binds the woman so it binds the man. As long as your wife is alive you cannot marry another. She can be alive but sick; she can be alive but a witch; she can be alive but mad (insane); or your husband may be alive but is the secretary to an occult society; he is alive but has become impotent such that he cannot touch you again. Whatever is the story, if the man/woman is still alive, then the matter is settled, no marriage anymore to another man or woman beside your first wife or husband. You may say, how can I cope, my body will be burning? God who gave this commandment will give you grace. Marriage is God’s business. You don’t interfere with it. He brought it about and will sponsor it. Follow Him. He will give you grace. Does He not know, does not the Almighty know, is He not just and equal to give you grace? Should there be a cut on any part of your flesh, blood would rush out through that cut; the white blood cells, at the same time, would rush to protect you and stop the flow of blood; that is grace. You have not seen grace in that area because nothing has happened. Whenever there is trouble somewhere that is when the police comes to calm the situation, but when you do not see the police, it is because there is peace in the area. Therefore, if there is marriage problem, grace will come. “Where sin abounds, grace doth much more abound”. There is therefore no excuse, O man, except you purposely do not want to obey, for “All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.” (Matthew. 19 verse 11). Every man cannot keep this saying; it is only to them for whom it is meant. That is the word of God which you should take seriously.    **\n \nSeparation in Marriage    **\nSeparation is allowed where it becomes very necessary otherwise it is damnable. \nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 10 to 11   **\n“ And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband, But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband, and let not the husband put away his wife.”   **\n\nLook at this scripture carefully. This scripture is saying, to those that have married actually, that there is no chance for divorce, but there is a window open at least for fresh air. In case the matter becomes too terrible to the point that it is the advice of everybody around and advice of the church, then there should be a separation, but not your own decision that you are going to leave. No. It is when the matter becomes terrible, may be your husband misbehaves or becomes mentally sick, threatening you with knife as if to stab, and neighbours begin to advise you to leave, it is then there is an open window for you to leave, so you can allow the matter to get calm, and then you could go back to your husband. It is a matter in which others can bear witness that separation may be required, not your decision. You cannot just take decision on your own to say, ‘I will leave this marriage, or I do not want to continue in this marriage again’. The sin of that is this  every time your husband commits adultery with any other woman you share the sin fifty-fifty (i.e. fifty percent each). So you cannot be doing your Christianity anywhere. They are saving sins for you in the bank of sin, because the Lord has told your husband that, in order to avoid fornication and adultery, every man should have his own wife and you are his wife, but you just left on your own. Both of you will go and pay for the sins the man is saving in the bank of sin after death. Do not say you keep your body, remember you are one with your husband. The other part of your body is not being kept. You are one, so you do not just jump up and say, ‘I am leaving this house’ or you tell your wife, ‘leave, go to the village or go and stay in the other place’. Many are practicing Christianity that will not take them to heaven. The man is in America, the woman is in Nigeria. What are they looking for? Money! And they are busy committing sin. ‘O yeah, I keep myself’, you say, but what about your partner that cannot keep himself or herself. It is still on your account. Why are you too careless that you have exalted money above the institution of God; that you separated yourselves and say you are looking for money? If there be any reason for separation, the Bible says, ‘let it be with consent and that for a time and come quickly together again’. It means there should not be any long interval lest Satan tempt you for your incontinency.  \nYou are disobeying the word of God for money, education, and for other matters in life. Look at it in First Corinthians 7 verse 4 to 5 \n“The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband, and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer;” (not even looking for money) “and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.”     **\nDoes this make provision for one staying in America for five years? If for any reason, of course, you may want to go on a course, yet it must be “with consent”. And it is a delicate moment because of Satan. And you are playing with eternal life? You may say, ‘God knows I keep myself’. Are you married? Your other self/partner may be somewhere not keeping himself or herself and you are responsible for that. Therefore be wise, be careful if you will go to heaven. Of holiness, the Bible says, “Without holiness no man shall see the Lord.” The implication is high, that is why the Bible says, “Keep your heart with all diligence.” “Thou has commanded us to keep thy precept diligently.” Be careful, so that you do not go off. Let not marriage be the reason that all you are doing will be vanity upon vanity.                                                   \n                        \n  \n \n \n \n \n\nChapter Four  Biblical View on Traditions in Marriage.  **\n \nParental Consent    **\nIn the Biblical view on marriage, we see that the parents of the girl or the woman, has power on her to release her for marriage or not to release her; to release her to a particular man or not. That is the authority of the father and God does not challenge it because He (God) gave it to him.   **\nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 36 to 38    **\n“But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not, let them marry. Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.”    **\nThere is someone that gives and the authority of that man should not be overlooked. You want to marry and you do not have business with the parent of the lady; that is not Christian marriage. The father of that woman has a will over her, to give her to you or not, and God is not charging him, except if there is a wicked purpose in him, God is not charging him sinful. It is his right, do not play him off. If you play off the man who has the right, then you stole his daughter; you did not enter through the door, “---He that entereth not by the door ---- but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.” (John 10 verse 1). You stole that woman because the parents were not aware; the parent did not give consent, you stole her. If you say, ‘I have seen the will of God to a woman’ and the Father of the woman says ‘I am not giving you my daughter; my daughter shall not marry an Igbo man; my daughter shall not marry a Yoruba man; my daughter shall not marry outside this country’, and you say, ‘forget what he is saying’. Don’t forget it. Take that matter to God in prayer, if that is the will of God, “The heart of the wicked is in the hand of the Lord”, how much more the heart of the righteous and of the common man, “as rivers of water He turneth it whithersoever He wills”. Take it to God and let Him change that man’s heart. If God promised you that woman, He will surely give her to you. He will go and work on the heart of her father. God will not go through the window. If you come to buy something in a provision store and the man is not there, will God climb through the window into the provision store and say to you, ‘take’? Not from God. There is no unrighteousness with God. He commands the man to exercise his will. He will appeal to the will of that man; just pray to God. In case you have prayed and prayed and prayed, and the man did not hear or change, that marriage is not the will of God. Abandon it and move forward, simple. He said in John 14 verse 14, “If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it”. I John 5 verse 14 to 15 says, “And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us, And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.”     **\nGenesis 24 verse 49 to 51    **\n“And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD, we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let \nher be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.”     **\nExpect this from your in-laws. This consent, expect it; try to have it; wait to have it; wait. In case you have jumped through the window already, go back and do restitution and receive parental consent, then you can stay together with your wife. Once this have been released upon you, dowry or no dowry, you have carried yourselves up to stay together, marriage has taken place and dowry can be paid later. Sometimes dowry is not required. From the passage above dowry was not required. So, if consent has been given, you can go and stay together as husband and wife, then you can come and pay later when you have the money.   **\nDon’t say, ‘I did not pay your dowry, go back to your father’s house’. The father has released her; she has been released to you, dowry or no dowry. All that is required is to pay later because you married her on credit. It is like, you bought a car on credit, it becomes yours and you are using it and it is getting old now. If it develops some noise and you now say you want to return the car, to whom are you returning it? It is the payment of the money that remains. You got the woman and now she is aging and has given birth to children already and you say you want to return her. To whom? That is the word of God, dowry or no dowry, parental consent is vital.   **\nCheck your marriage, is there parental consent, have they released that woman to you truly? Now you can stay. May be her father has even visited, prayed with and blessed you in the house. Perhaps you ran away before, but he forgave you and said, ‘I have forgiven you, I want my daughter to marry you, stay together and any time you are ready for dowry payment you can come’, the matter is finished. All that is required now is money. If you are going to miss heaven, it will be because you are a borrower who do not pay “for the wicked borroweth (a woman in this case) and does not pay”. It is not that you are committing adultery. No! \nYou are a borrower who do not pay. “Owe no man anything”. You are owing your in-laws, that is what you need to understand. Please, go and correct these other people that are mixing it up here and there.    **\n \nPayment of Dowry    **\nDowry may be required for your wife by her parents.    **\n \nGenesis 34 verse 8 to 12.     **\n“And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter, I pray you give her him to wife. And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. And ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me, but give me the damsel to wife.”     **\nAsk the parents what they want you to give. Let them give you their list; let them charge you. If they charge one million naira, plead because it is an open market. You plead and you beg. You, woman, join in begging. You know which person to catch (influence) among your parents, is that not so? You know. What if they demand from you alcohol, cigarette and any of these abominable things condemned by the scripture?    **\nMatthew 7 verse 11    **\n“If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?”   **\nOur Father, which is in heaven, only gives good things to them that ask. God does not give serpent; He does not give stone. So you cannot give anything that is corrupt  alcohol, cigarette or any other thing that is corrupt. You are children of your heavenly father that cannot give serpent and cannot give stone. You will tell them you are children of your Father, and the woman would have prepared them already, saying, ‘my husband is a child of God, he cannot do that’. That is why the church must supervise those who go to get married, to ensure everything is done well. Otherwise God will not be happy on the wedding day and He will not be there, because if the foundation is out of course, what is the hope of the righteous? Make sure things are followed in righteousness and holiness. There should be no immorality before marriage. Let the dowry payment and everything be done in righteousness and holiness. God will give you grace. However tough the in-laws are, they will eventually bow, if the woman is from God for your life; that is it. Jacob paid dowry through service.    **\n \nPublic Gathering   **\nThere may be or may not be public gathering. \n \nGenesis 24 verse 56 to 67    **\n“And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the Lord hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth. And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man, and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the south country. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide  and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master, therefore she took a vail, and covered herself. And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her, and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.”    **\nThe servant of Abraham went to take a wife for Isaac, when he arrived at the house of  Bethuel, it was only Bethuel and Laban that attended to him and released Rebekah to him; there was no public gathering. When the servant brought Rebekah to Isaac, Isaac took Rebekah into his mother’s tent and there was marriage and since then she became his wife.  There was no public gathering. We are saying that wedding is not mandatory when a man has satisfied the marriage conditions such as  parental consent, the will of the lady is sought for, and she is released to him, marriage has taken place. \nSome people got the woman to stay with them before her parents knew and then they go later to the parent to settle. If the parents accept them and say, ‘Ok, you can stay together, we have now given consent, we have accepted you’, that is marriage; marriage has taken place. It started in error, but is now rectified. Again, somebody may not have the money for wedding. He may just take his wife and tell the man of God to come and pray for them at once. When that is done, whether there are people or not, marriage has taken place because the conditions of marriage has been fulfilled. You can just ask the man of God to come and bless you and that is ok. We are saying this because there are people who think that when a man does not wed his wife in the church, he cannot be an elder in the church and he cannot be a minister too. It is not like that. God is the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and Isaac did not do any public wedding. What are they looking for, the consent of God or the praise of men? We are not saying this to discourage wedding, we are saying this because wedding has been carried to the extreme or excess and is discouraging people God wants to use. So that is what God wants you to know.        **                            \n                                \nChapter Five  Marriage Consummation    **\n \nGenesis 24 verse 64 to 67    **\n“And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master therefore she took a vail, and covered herself. And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her  and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.”       **           \nLook at this scripture; Isaac got Rebekah and had to examine her; ‘Do I accept this woman?’ Although everything about the marriage has been settled with her parents and they have released her, marriage has not been formed because Isaac was not there and there was still a process left. What was the process? The process was  Isaac brought her into his mother’s tent, they were in a room, then he took her and she became his wife - one flesh. There was knowing one another; they made love, they had sexual intercourse and that completed everything, which means that up to that moment, Isaac could reject that lady, saying, ‘you have settled everything with her parents but I am not interested in her’. And by not touching her, he said no, and Isaac would have been blameless up to that moment. But to consummate it, he took her into a room and they lay with each other.  That is how consummation of the marriage was done. Now you can see the role of sexual intercourse in consummation of marriage and in the cleaving of marriage. Why are we saying this? It is important because, there were people who married and did everything in the church, and when they got to the room, the woman discovered that the man was impotent. The Bible says “nevertheless to avoid fornication, let every woman have her own husband.” This was not marriage then, because the man did not have anything to keep the woman from fornication. It was not a sickness that came after the marriage, that would have been a hazard in marriage. Just as after marriage the man could have died, any sickness could have come or anything could have come, that would be a problem in the marriage. But in the above case, that which would have completed the marriage, the man did not have.    **\nI heard the story of a man from the western part of Nigeria who got married to his wife. When they went home, he discovered that they both (he and his wife) were men, with male organs. Then both of them were staring at each other. The groom was surprised because the face was the face of a woman, the voice was that of a woman, but the body was that of a man just as the voice was Jacob’s voice, and the body, Esau’s. In this case, do you now say you are married? No! You have not married because the woman is not correct. She does not have the property of a wife. But then there is something we must know when this kind of a thing happens. Let the man or woman raise a cry on time otherwise silence will be taken for agreement or for an answer. There is a period of time in which you should show this, otherwise it is taken that you have accepted it, so move forward, no separation on the basis of your acceptance. If you say no, then cry out, let us know immediately.    **\n\nDeuteronomy 22 verse 22 to 24   **\n“If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; so shalt thou put away evil from Israel. (They are both married people, they had consent so they could be killed.) If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city;”    **\nIt shows you are in consent, that is why the man was doing all those things and you were not crying. You were quiet until everything finished before you say the man forced you. What is your evidence? So give evidence at a time it is expected of you, then the people will know and bear witness that you are right, but if you stay and no noise from anywhere, don’t come back again and say ‘the reason why I could not continue is this, in fact this is my fifth year since I have been bearing it’. The Bible says, “beloved, let patience have her perfect work in your life, that ye may be perfect and entire” Since you have begun the life of patience “wanting nothing”  and you have stayed up to five years, I trust, it shall not be long. You know this teaching given here, came out of reasoning because Paul said in First Corinthians 7 verse 12 “But to the rest speak I, not the Lord, If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.” Paul said it is I who said. I speak in the same way, that it is my reasoning that made me speak on this peculiar matter because, if we all jump it, righteousness will not be complete and many will stumble and fall. For many who married such type of people and did not know what to do, eventually became adulterers since they could not keep themselves. They went about committing sins and the husbands might be telling them ‘go and sleep with anybody and bring me children, cover me up’. And since she has license from her husband she goes, and both are going to hell. “But ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free.” So I speak this by understanding that the Lord has given to me to save such situation.    **\n \nChapter Six  Biblical Stand on Marriage to an Unbeliever and a Believer   **\n \nMarriage to an Unbeliever   **\nIn case you have an unbeliever as your husband or as your wife, how do you live?                                        First Peter 3 verse 1 to 7    **\n“Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands, Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.”   **\nYou have a husband that is an unbeliever, what does the scripture say? The Bible commands you to submit to him, even in his life of sin and to live a holy life before him. Submit to your husband even in his sinful state, as an unbeliever. A person who does not believe commits which type of sins? Adultery, drunkenness, fighting, lying, abusing, unforgiveness and even marrying another wife. With all these put together, the Lord still says, “Submit to him”. Why are you so proud, that you think because your husband is married to a second wife, you say, ‘never, I cannot share my husband with her’? You will go and share him with her in hell. God says, “Submit”. The Lord knows he is a sinner and a sinner can do anything. And this tells you that those who are saying that immorality can cause divorce are lying, because the Bible says an unbeliever is a sinner. You, the Christian wife, submit to him. He is an adulterer, but submit. The Bible says, if you want to get him saved or born again, do not go the guyish, sophisticated, flamboyant way in dressing, in hair do, in decoration of yourself in this or that. No! Go the humble, quiet, gentle and holy way. Go that way, you may win him or else, he can do anything against you, but will never take your soul to hell. You will still keep your soul in that marriage.   **\nThe same thing goes for a believing husband whose wife is an unbeliever. Some of you would want to drag her. You feel you have more power than her. Jesus did not drag his family members who did not believe on him, for the Bible says, “Neither did his brethren believed on Him”. Do not force her, do not command her, ‘you must never wear earring in my house’. Please deal gently with her. If she says she will not remove it, leave her. We will understand with you because the scripture says you should stay with her, love her, care for her; in that way you may get her saved or she may remain permanently with the devil but your holy life will take you to heaven. She should not be the reason why you will go to hell. One of the brothers saw a woman wearing earrings in our meeting and said he was going to meet her to find out how she came into our meeting with earrings. I told him, she might be the wife of one of our brothers. John Wesley’s wife was a terrible woman but he loved and cared for her. She died in her sins, of course we did not hear that she repented before she died. Then she must be in hell now but John Wesley maintained his holiness and he is in heaven. That is why you should not let the unbelieving be anything to you, your heart should still love her. That is what the Bible tells us in  **\nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 12, \n“But to the rest speak I, not the Lord, If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.” A woman that does not believe can also commit adultery. Is it not possible? How will the Lord tell you to put away a woman for adultery when the Bible is saying ‘don’t put her away’? Can the scripture contradict itself?   **\nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 13 to 17    **\n“And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband, else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases  but God hath called us to peace. For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife? But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches”    **\nGod is involved in whatever happens between you and your wife. If she leaves, it becomes a divine calling on you to be single, “for he that is single careth for the things of the Lord”. If your husband say that you should go, it becomes God’s call on you to be single, “for she that is single careth for the things of the Lord but she that is married, careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband.”  It is another gracious calling; you will do more for Jesus. So, what Paul says is, you have an unbeliever as a wife, she is ok, she is wearing her earrings but she cooks food for you, she is not refusing you on the bed, she is so happy with you, satisfied being with you, takes care of the house, takes care of the children, why then, are you saying she must go because she wears earrings? Leave that matter, because she is not born again, leave that matter. Who knows whether with patience you will save your wife? Some of them will eventually become born again, so leave her alone. \nSimilarly you have a husband that does not believe but he is still ready to live with you, allow him. When I went to Italy I met a white man there that got married to an African lady. Whenever they were going to the church, he would escort his wife and be a nanny to their son, a child of about one year old. He would wait outside till the service finished. When service finished, he would take his wife and child back home to continue their life. When I saw what was happening, I called the man and spoke of Jesus to him and when he said he was ready to accept the Lord, I led him to Christ and rejoiced that he was born again. Unfortunately, he is not yet born again, because up to this time, when I called the wife, she told me the same thing is still going on. It was because they came to the church together, he was outside that I preached to him. Up till now he is still doing the same business; come to church, wait for his family somewhere till service is finished, then they go home happily. Woman, you want to leave that type of man? Allow him until God will visit him. But if he refuses, allow him, it will not affect your Christian life. Even if it does, God has given you victory over it. If you go away, do you not know that your presence there gives that man the privilege of getting saved? Your prayer does not allow demons to come to that place. The demons wait for him outside, very far away, but whenever he is coming to the house, the demons would say, ‘you know your wife is in that house so I will not come with you’. You know, gradually like that there can be grace for him to become born again, that is why you should not leave him. Again what about the children, you want to leave the man, he might snatch the children from you because they are his children and he will take them to sin. Your presence is helping something on those children, so do not do anything like that.    **\nMan, you want your wife to go because she is not co-operating or she is not going to church? Who knows whether you will save her? Be patient. But in case the woman decides to say, she will leave, allow her do it as she wants. Who knows the damage that woman would do to you tomorrow? Do you think you could have eventually saved her? Let her go. Or the man may decide to say, ‘I will divorce’, allow him to do it as he wants. Do not refuse because you do not know the damage that man would cause you tomorrow. Do you think you could have eventually saved him?  \nLet him go, “For all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose”. It may become grace unto you. “But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk”, (First Corinthians 7 verse 17). If the Lord has granted that you would not have a husband, or you would stay alone, go and serve the Lord in that way; it is grace. There are many married women today who are wishing they were not married, that they would have served God better. There are many married men today who wishing they were not married, that they would have served God better. Paul even said “I would that all men were even as myself”. So you have opportunity to be like Paul, don’t bother about those things.   **\nHusband, what if the Lord brings her back by tomorrow? The prodigal son will one day come back home. So you should not go and marry another. No! What if the prodigal son comes back home? You will have two wives. Woman, what if the prodigal son comes back home? What will you do to your husband, if you have married another? The Bible says, stay unmarried if he or she departs.    **\n \nMarriage to a Believer    **\nEphesians 5 verse 21 to 33    **\n“Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church, and he is the saviour of the body. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church, For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.”     **\nWives, reverence and honour your husbands, and you, husbands, love your wives. You know when Paul started writing, the Holy Spirit started with the woman, “wives submit yourselves to your own husband”. It seems, if submission is done, loving becomes easy. If these women that are going up and down will submit, they will enjoy their marriage. This submission is for yourself. “The merciful man doeth good to his own soul” (Proverbs 11 verse 17). “The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him”. (Ezekiel 18 verse 20). The submission you are making is for yourself. If you have not been enjoying marriage, go and start submission, you will find that things will just change. If a little child runs to you and wants to play with you; you know he is a little child, what will you do to be able to play with the child? You will bend down. If you want your husband to bend down, you go down in submission, that man will bend down, he will meet you there. You will humble him down there. See how you play with a child, with love, with joy. Make yourself like that, loving. Play with your husband like a child would do. He will calm down, submit fully like that, he will calm down. Submit in everything. Husbands love your wife, this is a heavy task, because you are compared to Christ, who loved without condition. Not that we first loved him, but that He first loved us, “But God commendeth His love towards us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” The woman really have many problems with herself, but as Christ would love without condition, even to the point of sacrificing himself, do likewise and you will eventually have that woman polished, sanctified and serving you joyfully. You will enjoy yourself in your paradise on earth. If your husband is an unbeliever then you need wisdom as a wife or if your wife is an unbeliever, you need wisdom as a husband. You need counsel, you need patience, and you need to pray. I pray that God will do a new thing in your life, a new thing in your marriage. Amen.                        \n \n \n \n \n\n\n",

It centres on the commandment and wisdom of the Holy Scripture on raising up godly children for God and the society.  **\nThe book is loaded with the powers of scripture that will compel parents into appropriate actions towards their children in the fear of God.  **\n Second Timothy 3 verse 15 to 17   **\n 15And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. \n16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;\n17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.  **\nFollow the scriptural guidance provided in this book and make this your hand book on child raising and training, and you will have testimonies to give on God`s conversion and commitment to godliness amongst your children.   **\n Deuteronomy 6 verse 6 to 7    **\n 6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; \n7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.  **\nThis book shows you why children behave the way they do, and how to overcome the powers of the forces that spoil children. It encourages those in the western world not to submit to the corrupt laws of the government which are contrary to the eternal laws of God on child raising and training. The scripture strongly exhorts parents to apply proper discipline to their erring children. Not to do so is to spoil them.  **\n\nProverbs 22 verse 15   **\nFoolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.  **\nProverbs 23 verse 14    **\n“Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.”  **\nParents must learn to ask God for help in their duty of child raising and training. Truly, some children are overwhelmingly stubborn, but there is hope for them in Christ. Invite Jesus Christ to your family to help you raise your children for Himself  the Lord needs them in His vineyard for His end time gospel exploit. Please raise up godly children for Jesus!    **\n\n\nCHAPTER 1   **\nGOD IS THE GIVER OF CHILDREN   **\n1.1 Every Child Given by God has a Purpose to Fulfil in His Will  **\n Genesis 33 verse 5   **\n“And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant.”   **\n God is the giver of children. He gives them by His own grace to mankind. Children are ignorant, innocent little human beings, male and female, conceived and brought into this world of sin and Satan, in order to fulfil the will of God their Creator. God gave them for a purpose, to fulfil His will. That is why you should not look commonly on the child God gave you. He is given to you by the grace of God, to fulfil the will of God.   **\n Revelation 4 verse 11   **\n“Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power, for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created. “  **\n\nIsaiah 43 verse 7  **\n  “Even every one that is called by My name, for I have created him for My glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.”   **\n1.2 Untrained Children Are Tools In Satan's hands for evil works.   ** \nWhen children are left alone without godly training, without the salvation that is in Christ, they naturally develop evil and wicked hearts and live in the society as wicked men and women; disobedient men and women; completely ignorant of God. If nothing is done to the child that God has given you; if the child is left alone without training in godliness; that child will get corrupted. If you cook your food or soup and leave it without appropriate care, it will become corrupt with time, because the atmosphere has corrupting power that corrupts whatever is improperly exposed to it. So also does the force of evil in the world make children naturally go off track of morality. The power of sin that is in children make them turn off from God as they grow up. Jesus called some people children of Satan because of their character and hatred of God.  **\nJohn 8 verse 44   **\n“ Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own  for he is a liar, and the father of it.”    **\nThe Bible addressed some people as, Children of Belial, children of Satan.  **\nDeuteronomy 13 verse 13    **\n“Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known.”  **\n Judges 20 verse 13    **\n“Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel. “   **\nSecond Samuel 2 verse 12   **\n“ Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.”   **\nThese people addressed as children of Satan were children God graciously gave to their parents, but were not given godly training. They were left to themselves.  **\n 1.3 Your Carelessness is Responsible for your Child's Foolishness    **\nKing Solomon passed by the vineyard of a man lacking understanding and when he looked; he saw that the walls of the vineyard had been broken down. The walls that prevented animals from entering in had been broken down because there was no repair, no maintenance. He saw that the vineyard was overgrown with weeds. The bad condition of this vineyard was because the vineyard was abandoned by the owner. As he looked at it, he knew who the owner of the vineyard was  a lazy man, one that loved sleep, leisure, pleasure and did not want to fatigue himself. His vineyard brought shame and reproach to him.  **\n Proverbs 24 verse 30 to 33  **\n 30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;\n 31 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. \n32 Then I saw, and considered it well, I looked upon it, and received instruction. 33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep.   **\n In the same way, the Bible says   **\n Proverbs 17 verse 21   **\n “He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow, and the father of a fool hath no joy. “  **\nIf your child is a foolish child or a wayward child, you will have no pleasure in him. You will be in sorrow. But then, what caused the child to be a fool? You were responsible! You did not care for that child that was graciously given to you.  **\nProverbs 17 verse 25.   **\n “A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.”   **\nA stubborn child, a wicked and, disobedient child, causing trouble in the house and in the society is a grief to the father. He causes bitterness of heart to his mother. Many parents today are in sorrow because of their children. The enemy is plaguing families and marriages a lot in this area. Many parents wished they did not have children, because of the life of their children. They are always being put to shame. The mother will enter into the room and cry, as people meet her and say, “So that stubborn child is your son? Take care of your son!” The mother is in shame, she is in bitterness. Because of the activities of Satan that have increased greatly in these last days, families, parents and the society are spending their time in sorrows. Even brothers and sisters, children of the same father and mother are lamenting because of the behaviour of the siblings. Come, weep with this man in the book of Lamentation.  **\nLamentations 1 verse 16    **\n“For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me, my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed.”   **\n“My children have become useless. I gave birth to children, but they became something else. They became scorpions and serpents. My enemy has prevailed. Satan has laid his hands upon my children. My eyes run down with water. I am crying, I am weeping”. \nWhat do we say of the single parent; a mother that does not have a husband to help her care for these children? Or the widow that does not have the father to help her care for these children? The children would oppress their mother! They despise their mother! She laments, “The enemy has prevailed. The children are not hearing me, for this I weep and I cry.”   **\n Lamentations 2 verse 11    **\n Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.    **\n This is an observer that looked to the streets and saw wayward children. He saw corrupt children on the streets in their evil character, wickedness, evil dressing, and nakedness. He said, “I cried, tears were falling from my eyes. I cried out my strength, because the children and the suckling swooned in the streets of the city.” You can now see the situation  stubborn children, wicked children, wayward children, disobedient children, ungodly children fighting against God and righteousness. As the people of God gather, they go there with occult powers to disrupt them. Is not your child among those who disrupt God's work? They have joined the army of Satan. Your son is even looking for you to kill. It is a sorrowful thing. Satan is behind this matter.   ** \nJohn 10 verse 10    **\nThe thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy.   **\n Woman of God, man of God, how did your son fall into the hands of thieves? How did your daughter fall into the hands of thieves? They are training them to steal, and they themselves are training others to do evil. They smoke marijuana; they take drugs, looking foolish and stupid on the streets. I pray that God will wipe away your tears. May the Lord bring an end to this shame. I pray that the other children you are giving attention to will not get corrupted in your hand in Jesus name. Amen.  **\n1.4 The Endtime Spirit is Taking Its Toll On Untrained Children  **\nThe situation is worse in this end time.  **\n Second Timothy 3 verse 1 to 5.   **\n1This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. \n2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,\n3Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, \n4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 5Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof,  from such turn away.  **\nDisobedient children! No regard for parents! Your daughter is ready to fight you, throw you down, and sit upon you, speaking rudely, “Do not talk like that to me again. Promise me now otherwise I leave home.” It is as bad as that. Your son is ready to fight you. He learnt it from the wicked world. They have taught him to do it, so he cannot listen to you anymore. He cannot wash your clothes again. He cannot send him on errand again. He cannot join you in doing any work. He cannot be told when to sleep or when to wake up. He does not want to go to school and you cannot compel him. If he goes to school, he does as he like there.\n The last days! Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof. The ones that come to church have no Christianity in their lives. Do they not play in the choir and still commit immorality and incest? They sing in the choir. Are they original? There is a God that sees. There is a God that is watching. They do many evil things that one will say, “Ah! Ah! Are you not the one in the choir?” But why are you like this? The enemy has done this. The last days!  **\n\nChapter2   **\nSOURCES OF CORRUPTION IN CHILDREN AND YOUTHS  **\nWhat are the things that have affected the lives of youths and children? **\n2.1 Peer Group Pressure  **\nFirst Corinthians 15 verse 33 \nBe not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners.  **\nProverbs 13 verse 20    **\nHe that walketh with wise men shall be wise, but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.  **\nBecause your child must have friends, friends teach one another evil. Your daughter belongs to a peer group and is influenced by some friends. How can she keep virginity anymore, when her friend of 14 years said, “What are you keeping it for? You are a shame to the society. You are not a woman yet. How can you be boasting of being a virgin at 15? You are not a woman yet!” And they begin to laugh at her! Her friend then suggests, “I will provide a man for you. Remove this shame from us. You have not seen the sweetness of life.” That is the pressure on the innocent child. That is peer pressure! \nTo the young man that has never slept with a woman, the friends are saying, “What! Then you are not a man. Come, let me show you how to do it.” That is what is going on. Peer group! Boys and girls that have no parents, that have no godly parents, that have been left to themselves and are a shame to the society and to their parents, are now the best friends of your children. They are the ones teaching them wickedness and training them how to do evil. They teach them how to commit immorality and how to steal. Peer group! Amnon had a friend, Jonadab was his name, a very intelligently evil boy. Jonadab, the friend, taught Amnon how to commit immorality with his sister. He said, “I will give you the formula, very cheap. You look foolish. Okay, go and lie down and tell your father you are sick and also say that only your sister Tamar can prepare the type of meal that will give you taste. That will make your father come to you. Your father will accept your request. Then you can have her. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!” He touched him and said, “Boy.” And that is how that boy went off and died eventually.  **\n\nSecond Samuel 13 verse 3 to 14, 28 to 29.  **\n3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, and Jonadab was a very subtil man. \n4 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister. \n5 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand. \n6 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick; and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand. \n7 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat.\n8 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. \n9 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him. \n10And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother. \n11 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister. \n12 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel, do not thou this folly. \n13And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.\n 14 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice; but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her. \n28 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not, have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.\n 29 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled.   **\nThat is the tension your child is facing.  **\n 2.2 Music    **\n Music! The devil has gotten hold of music. Music is the most appealing thing to the flesh. It makes people dance, sing rough words and speak slangs. The music of our day goes with pornography. The musicians bring naked women and actual acts of immorality into the music. The people singing and dancing in the contemporary music are stars. Your child wants to be a star too, so he thinks, “I can do what this boy is doing.” Your daughter thinks, “I can do what this girl is doing. I can be  like her.” They train your daughter to stand in her underwear. She watches it, so fear and shame are no more there. Shame is gone. They teach her harlotry right in her father's house through music and, of course, they are making a name. She wants to make a name too. They are paying them much for such nakedness. She needs the money too. She has gotten a friend who told her how much she made and has bought a car with it. Music and dancing! A great force against children!!  **\n 2.3 Television    **\nTelevision has become a nanny. It has taken over the family. Parents tell their child, “Watch and do not cry. Watch, do not mind eating food.” The child really will not bother about eating food. In these days of work, work, work! They set a television in front of the child and say, “Here is it. Here are your favourite stations, go ahead, watch, until I come back.” That is a school the child is going through in the house. He is watching and the world and Satan are ready to train him. When you return, he begins to say, “Chu! Cho! Chu!” You say, “What is happening?” He has learnt it and is practicing it!   **\nPsalm 101 verse 33    **\n I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes, I hate the work of them that turn aside; shall not cleave to me.    **\nWhen children, a boy and a girl who are brother and sister, have watched pornography, no matter  how short the scene is, they will want to practice it. They will say, “The man did like this and the woman opened like this.” Before you know it they will do like that and open like that right in your house. It has happened several times before and it is still happening. I heard of a boy that killed one of his brothers or so, with a knife, having watched Kungfu where they used knives to fight. Chu! Chu! Chu! So he carried a knife and “Chu” on his sibling. It entered straight. Television! What a corrupt thing, bringing wickedness of the world to your house, making Satan to be in charge of your house. May be you watch along with them too and are laughing, it is sinking into them. They do not have self-control like you.  **\nGalatians 6 verse 7,8    **\n7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked, for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. \n8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.  **\n 2.4 Films/Movies    **\nFilms of crime, witchcraft and pornography are available in the market. Children know when and how to go and buy them and when you are sleeping they watch them and learn witchcraft. They watch “Power Pass Power.” What your eyes see, your heart desires. They watch sexual performance going on live in various forms. How can they watch those things and not be corrupted by them? When you come to a house where a nice meal is being prepared, your mouth salivates. The saliva is formed by itself. The heart begins to wish for the meal. That is so with the children. As they watch it, their body gets strongly stirred. Many are exposed to these things right from childhood. In about five years to come we shall have a terrible world, because of these things they watch.   **\nSecond Peter 2 verse 14    **\n14 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls, an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children   **\n 2.5 The Internet    **\nChildren can easily have access to the internet on their phones. They can access it on their computers. They go to the sites where the devil has arranged wicked things. All these things Satan has arranged to expose them to wickedness. How to be initiated into witchcraft is clearly there. If you want to join illuminati it is there. The child innocently goes to those sites and before you know it he is initiated. You say, “I am not a witch, my husband is not a wizard, what happened to you?” It is the internet. That is the world we are living in now. Oh! Many parents' eyes are running down with water, their eyes are running down with water for shame and sorrow because of their children. More than parental shame and sorrow is the judgement of hell fire awaiting them.  **\nIsaiah 30 verse 9 to 11    **\n9 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the LORD;\n 10 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits; \n11 Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.    **\n 2.6 The Institutions    **\nSchools! Corruption in schools! Schools are given to immorality  immorality with the teachers to pass examinations. The students commit immorality with one another for pleasure. The students practice masturbation, oral sex, homosexuality, lesbianism, pornography, and every kind of sex freely. The environment is free and safe. Only the determined can escape pollution in schools. The miniskirts given to female students in the primary and secondary schools as uniforms are meant to expose their nakedness and promote immorality right early, unawares to them.  **\n2.7 Restaurants/Bill boards    **\n Go to restaurants, Mr Biggs and some of these restaurants, you will see pornography going on there. We went to Etisalat telecoms office, when we wanted to get an Etisalat mobile line. I saw pornography on display there. I asked the attendant, “Why are you keeping this?” He said, “It is not me. It is coming from our headquarters. You cannot touch it, or change it, if you do not want to lose your job.” The world already is fully equipped to remove the last righteousness from men. You can control yourself, but the child cannot. We must take these things to God and cry to Him. What about the advertisement bill boards? Immorality! Nakedness! That is what is displayed on most of them on the roadside and in the city.  **\n2.8 The Government    **\n The Government is saying, “Give condom to your children and give them freedom to use them. Give them liberty. If you do not give them liberty, we will handle you.” The Government is supporting the corruption of the children. Satan has bought the government over. They permit both sex and witchcraft education in the schools. Sex is now one of the schools subjects. The world is fighting God. The world is fighting righteousness. The world is starting with the children because they know that if you want to transplant a crop you do so when it is young. When it grows up it will show no sign of transplanting, it will look normal. So they are getting them quite young. Some of these nations are teaching witchcraft in the schools, to clear out what remains of righteousness, so that there will be no righteousness in this world we live in. In some nations, the Government has decreed that if you beat your child, you will go to prison or the child will be taken away from you and be given to another mother. They have prepared mothers, and built homes to accommodate children. This is what is going on in the western world. In some of the countries where the government has already sanctioned those laws, when the child comes to school the teachers ask, “Did your mother beat you? Did your father touch you? Tell me.” If the child replies, “Yesterday my mother beat me,” the next thing is that police will arrive at the mother's house because the mother has transgressed the government's rule. “Your child reported in school that you beat him.” They can ask the child, “What do we do with your mother now? Tell us what we should do.”  **\n Romans 1 verse 21,22   **\n 21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  **\n 22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.  **\nA child was sitting with her mother who was partially deaf in one ear and so speaks out loud. The child did something and the mother shouted at her to correct her. In a short time a policeman was knocking at the door. This is because the schools have given the children police numbers and told them, “Call them anytime; should anything threaten you at home  just call the police.” You know a child likes to practice something learned. A policeman arrived and knocked at their door. The mother opened the door and said, “Yes?” The policeman said, “I am invited to this house.” The mother said, “No! Nobody invited you in this house.” The policeman asked, “Who are the people here?” She replied, “Only myself and my eight year old daughter.” The policeman asked the girl, “Girl, did you invite me here?” The girl said, “Yes.” This happened in America. The mother was shocked. The policeman asked the girl, “What happened?” The girl said, “My mother shouted at me!” “Why did you shout at this girl?” The policeman questioned the woman and then said, “Girl, what do we do to her?” The girl said, “Let her go and remain in the cell for two weeks.” That was how the mother was taken to the cell, so that she should learn her lesson. The police warned the woman, after she completed her term of incarceration, “If you try this thing again, this child shall be taken from you, she is an American child.” That is how the parents live there. They have put them in bondage. The devil is using the Government because iniquity must take over the world. Are you sitting still? They are digging under you and they will soon fall you down. So you must cry to God for your salvation and that of your children.  **\n2.9 False Churches and Pastors  **\nSecond Corinthians 11 verse 13 to 15  **\n13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the   apostles of Christ. \n14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. \n15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.   **\nThere are churches established just to initiate people into occultism. That is their whole aim. The children teachers are demonic. They distribute themselves to various churches, under instruction  “Go and show zeal in the churches. Show them that you love children.” They are there on assignment, to initiate children into witchcraft. Where was your child initiated? It was in the church, by children teachers. So where do you go now? Satan's ways are so many that only God can give you an escape route. The female children may be fingered by the male teachers, introducing them to immorality quite early. The films shown and the drama taught in some of the churches stir children to evil practice.  **\n 2.10 Poverty   **\n Poverty too, is playing its own role. Because of lack of money, a man and his wife and about five children, making seven persons are all sharing one room. A story was told of a child whose parents used a curtain to separate their bed from them. Whenever the bed was making noise, he knew that something was happening on the parents' side. So the child, an intelligent one, put a mirror up directly on top of their parents' bed. So, when the parents began mating, he would be watching his parents in the mirror performing live pornography. Poverty has caused that. The parents could not afford two or three rooms for the family. But most times this is due more to ignorance than poverty. This also makes the child to see the nakedness of one another as they sleep, take bath and change their clothes. Incest is highly promoted under this condition.   **\n2.11 Wayward parents   **\nThe way the parents dress, the children follow the style. They follow their parents' naked dressing. The clothes some parents buy for their children are terrible. All these miniskirts you buy for your children, do you remember you have boys? Do you know that your female child can sit down anyhow or lie down exposing her body? And that your boy will not remember that she is his sister? Some parents contribute to incest in the house. Some mothers expose their nakedness to their male children to their sexual provocation in the house. The bathroom may be poorly covered, exposing the females taking bath to their male siblings. This condition keeps the male children loaded with sexual feeling.   **\n\n2.12 Devil's “Operation Catch Them Young”     **\nMultiplied initiation is going on. Many people want to be rich, so Satan tells them the number of people they should initiate in order to get money. \nMultiplied children are initiated into witchcraft. It is no more in those days that except your father is a wizard or your relation is a witch; you may never be initiated into witchcraft. No! It is no more like that again. “Oh God of heaven, we are saying this in sorrow and in pain. We are saying it in tears. Lord we have not power nor might in this matter. If you do not arise, what shall we do? If you do not do anything, (like the king of Samaria, when someone cried to him and said, Help O king, and he said, How do I help? If God does not help you? How can I help you, from the barn or from the storehouse?”) “What shall the righteous do?” Children suffer initiation into witchcraft in the house, school and in the church.  **\n Second Chronicles 20 verse 11 to 13   **\n11 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of Thy possession which Thou hast given us to inherit. \n 12 O our God, wilt Thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee. \n13And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children.   **\nChristians are passing through this danger everywhere; seek God's help! Parents are passing through this sorrow everywhere. If God does not intervene, where do we go? The world is waxing strong in evil. Things are increasingly getting worse. Children have been led astray from early age. Some are initiated from the womb. It is a matter of sorrow indeed. It is a matter of concern and the game is also being played in the house of the pastor, to quench the ministry of the man of God. They tell the child, “Bring your mother. We will make you king, we will make you queen. Bring your father. Child, go and put this thing in your mother's food.” And they threaten them too saying, “We will beat you if you do not do it. We will kill you!” So the child does those things under threat. \nOur God shall reverse those things. Amen. Parents are put into various bondage by children. Some parents are put into poverty because the child is in covenant with the devil to empty the purse of the family. Some suffer sickness  this one is sick, that one is sick, the other one is sick. There is no rest. A child who caused the father to lose his job said, “They told me to do this so that you will come and sit at home. Then you and mummy will be blaming each other. As you are crying in poverty, Satan is laughing and they are promoting me there. Mummy, we are the one that shut up your womb. You will not give birth anymore. I will be your only child. It is enough by force.” Listen to God's word directed to you who loves the Lord Jesus    **\nIsaiah 41 verse 9 to 14   **\n9 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art My servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.\n 10Fear thou not; for I am with thee be not dismayed; for I am thy God, I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of My righteousness.\n 11Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded, they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall perish. 12Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that contended with thee; they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. \n13For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee. \n14Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.   **\n\n\nCHAPTER 3  **\nLEAD YOUR CHILDREN TO JESUS FOR THEIR SALVATION   **\nJohn 14 verse 6   **\nJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.  **\n Isaiah 48 verse 17 to 19  **\n17 Thus saith the LORD, Thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.\n18 O that thou hadst hearkened to My commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea;\n19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before Me.   **\n3.1 Follow God's Instructions and Do Them   **\nVarious plagues are being inflicted on parents. But let us go back to divine instructions on children. God who is more powerful than Satan has given us divine instructions. Follow them. Do not be lazy like that lazy man whose vineyard king Solomon saw. Do not be lazy like him. Rise up and do this job otherwise, your hope for heaven will be a mirage. Rise up and train your children and listen to what the scripture says. Do it, do not respect the contrary decree of the Government of your nation. Be wise, the way of the wise is above to deliver from evil beneath. Be wise and deliver your children. Who comes to your children? Who teaches your children? Who relates with your children? Who is a friend to your children? Monitor everything. God will help you. God who does not want you and your children to perish, will stand behind you. He will put His angel in your house. You just need to obey God.  **\n3.2 Lead your Children to the Lord Jesus  **\n Matthew 19 verse 13 to 15  **\n13 Then were there brought unto Him little children, that He should put His hands on them, and pray, and the disciples rebuked them. \n14 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not to come unto Me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven. \n15And He laid His hands on them, and departed thence. Jesus said, “Bring those children to Me.   **\nDedicate them to Me. Commit those children to Me. Why are you keeping them away from Me?” Bring them to the church. Why do you think that the gospel is not for children? Do not mind the noise they are making in the Church. The angels of God are there, taking care of them and helping them to pick one, two or three words from what the preacher is saying. Jesus is saying, “Bring children to Me. I want to lay My hands upon them. I want to use them. I want to bless them. The kingdom of God is for them.” You have heard the testimony that a child of about six years was found in hellfire. A girl of eight or nine years, she used witchcraft to kill eight people. God said, “Bring them to Me, I will deliver them, I will save them from sin.” Lead them to Jesus. Ask Jesus to come into their hearts. Let Jesus come into their lives and change them. He told you to bring them to Him. This is a divine instruction. Do not say my husband is the one hindering me. Take the child aside and lead him to Jesus. Do not say, “My wife is the one to do it.” You do it! The commandment is for you to obey. Do not mind how many times the child has been led to Jesus; continue to do so, until you see the evidence.   **\n3.3 Train up Your Child    **\nProverbs 22 verse 6   **\n Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.  **\n Show the child how to do it. Tell him about it. Some children may be stubborn, continue to give them the same instructions, not minding their refusal, resistance, forgetfulness and outright disobedience. With prayers they will pick and submit.  **\nEcclesiastes 11 verse 1   **\nCast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days.  **\nTraining also means the person does not know how to do things. Show him how to do it. The person does not know how to drive a car, you train him. The person does not know how to construct a table as a carpenter, you train him. \nTraining a child means you have a vision for that child. There is something, a set goal or direction you want in the child. If you do not have a vision, the wisdom of training will not come. You will not know the materials of training to use. But if you have a vision of what you want in your child, you will find the materials or tools to use. Train up a child in the way he should go. \nTraining involves knowing the 'dos' and 'don'ts'. It involves impartation of knowledge. Put the right knowledge in your child. Tell your child what to do and what he is not to do. When he is old, he will not depart from it. There are people who have trained their children on how to prostrate and greet their elders. They prostrate to greet even in their adult age. They learnt it. There are people who have trained their children on how to cook food. They grow up to cook fine meals that rejoice the heart. You are training them because you have a vision that your children should not be a shame in their husband's house. The word of God says, “Train up your child.” Involve yourself in this training, however busy you are. Employ persons in school, church, or your relations and professionals to assist you, if you can find. Use good materials of training to assist you.   **\nEcclesiastes 4 verse 9 to 12   **\n 9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. \n10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow, but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.\n 11Again, if two lie together, then they have heat, but how can one be warm alone?\n 12And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.  **\nSingle parents need counselling in this area also. They may require participation of others in training the children. Such should not be ashamed to seek help from close ones for the training of their children.  **\n 3.4 Teach the Children God's Word   **\nDeuteronomy 11 verse 18 to 21   **\n 18 Therefore shall ye lay up these My words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. \n19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. \n20 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates;  \n21 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.   **\nCan you see? Teach your children the word of God. Teach them all the doctrines  Salvation, Sanctification, Restitution, Baptism in the Holy Ghost. Teach them about the second coming of Christ. Teach them Biblical marriage. Teach them about water baptism, that when they are born again they need to be baptised in water. Teach them all the Word of God. The Bible says teaching requires wisdom.  **\nColossians1 verse 28   **\nWhom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus   **\nWhat will you use to cause the child to understand the teaching? Get the teaching aids. Get the teaching materials. Your child has been watching pornography and wrong videos. Get educative and godly films for your children to watch. Tell them the evils in pornography and ungodly films that they are watching. Warn your  children against evil. Educate them. Get them books, like the devotional. Let the children learn how to read the devotional book every day, even in school. Tell them to carry the devotional book to school. Supervise! Check whether your instruction is being followed. Ask questions. Ask, “Which one did you read today? What did you learn about it?” Check it out. Train your children. Teach them the Word of God. Get your children good Bibles. Teach them how to read the Bible. Give them assignments in the Bible and some Christian books. Let them listen to the CDs and the DVD messages on righteousness and holiness. Tell them to listen to a number of messages and take down notes. The God of heaven who asked you to do this, will work with you.  **\n Mark 16 verse 20    **\nAnd they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.  **\nThe Lord will work with you, confirming your word, your service with signs following. You will see the result in your children. The Lord shall confirm your service in Jesus name. That is what God expects you to do.  **\nProverbs 31 verse 27, 28  **\n27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. \n28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.    **\nOnly parents that are born again and love the Lord with all their hearts can be good trainers of children to make them fear God and serve Him well.  **\nMatthew 7 verse 3 to 5  **\n 3And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\n 4Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?\n 5Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.    **\nTo lead your children to the Lord Jesus, you parents must be true believers. To lead them from sin to righteousness, you too must be righteous and holy.  **\n\n\nCHAPTER 4   **\nAPPLY SCRIPTURAL DISCIPLINE ON YOUR CHILDREN   **\n4.1 Do Not Leave Children All By Themselves   **\nDo not through your carelessness make your children to become wayward. You spend all the time before television to the neglect of your children. Some of you are so lost looking for money that your children are going to hell and consequently you too are going to hell, because of money.  **\nSecond Timothy 6 verse 10    **\nThe love of money is the root of all evil, which some haven coveted after have pierced their souls with many sorrows.   **\nSorrows caused by children! Yes I know the matter is hard because you must labour to get food for them. As you are labouring to get food for their bodies, what about the food for their souls? As you are labouring to educate them, what about educating them on Jesus, Holiness and Heaven? You must do all things well. You just must come to God to make you a qualified parent. That is the responsibility He has given to you and you must keep it up. A person that goes to the university to  study must study all the courses for his discipline and must pass them all; otherwise, he will not obtain the certificate. Pass all your exams. Work hard on your children.  **\n 4.2 Apply Family Planning method appropriate to you   **\nIf you know you will not be able to cater for many children, tell God, “Lord, I want just is number.” The desire of the righteous shall be granted. Apply the appropriate righteous method of family planning. Do not listen to those who are attacking family planning. They are speaking from the devil who does not want you to know the truth that will set you free. Control the number of children you bear so that you do not live a foolish life. So that you may not live a life of sorrow and bitterness in this world because of children. But for you who have given birth to many children before coming to know the wisdom in family planning, look to God to show you mercy and help you out.  **\nActs 17 verse 30    **\nAnd the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent.    **\nPresent your ignorance to God and say, “God help me now. I was ignorant of these things.” Work hard to rise up godly children for Jesus, He needs them. He said, “Bring them to Me, I will use them in this endtime. I will put My Spirit in them and they will prophesy.”  **\nJoel 2 verse 28    **\nAnd it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions   **\n 4.3 Discipline the Children in a Godly Way  **\n God wants you to discipline your children in a godly way.  **\nProverbs 13 verse 24   **\n “He that spareth his rod hateth his son, but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.”   **\nThis scripture is saying, you should apply discipline on your child quite early in life. Do not be so merciful and compassionate that you cannot use a cane to beat your child. O woman, do not hate your child! O man, do not hate your child! It is an evil mother or evil father that refuses to use the cane on their children.  **\nProverbs 13 verse 24  **\n24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son, but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.”  **\nIt means that he that loves his child will start to beat him when he is still small; quite early enough. 'Betimes' means early. Do it early. He is not too young to receive the cane. God who created the child says, “I have put miracle power in the cane as I put miracle power in the rod of Moses. It will  change your child!” Do not toy with the cane. Do not joke or take disciplining with the cane casually. Buy a cane and keep in the house and let your child know about it. Tell your child to touch it. Tell him, “It is waiting for you.” That child will be conscious of that cane. One day he may say, “Mother, this cane is still here.” You will just say, “Leave it there.” His aim of reminding you is to hear whether you will tell him to go and throw it away. Say, “No! Leave it there. It is there for you.” The word says that in beating the child you are demonstrating practical love for him. Some of the discipline we give to people who work under us is seen as hatred. No! We want them to be better. We love them. It is not that we hate them. God wants you to do good to your children, to protect them from Satan. Do not mind the power of the devil. Follow the word of God and you will see his angels helping you on your children.  **\n Psalm 34 verse 7 to 8  **\n7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them. \n8 O taste and see that the LORD is good, blessed is the man that trusteth in Him.  **\nChristian parents must discipline their children in a godly way. Your motive must be pure. There must be no partiality between one child and the other. The cause of the chastisement must be clear to the child, so that he does not see it as hatred and oppression. There must be control in discipline and the method applied must not be the  one to cause injury on the child. Always seek God's guidance and wisdom. Make your child see God in the discipline.  **\nEphesians 6 verse 4  **\nAnd, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath  but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. \nThis scripture shows that there is God's way of child discipline and child training which the Bible outlines for us.  **\n4.4 Discipline your Children While there is Hope  **\nProverbs 19 verse 18    **\n“Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.”  **\nThere is a time when there will be no more hope. There is a time when there is nothing you can do to that child anymore. But there is a time when there is still hope. There is a time you will take the cane and he will despise it. But there is a time he is still afraid of cane. So, chasten your child, use the cane when there is hope. That is what the word of God is telling us. Correct your son when there is hope and let not your eyes or soul spare cane because of his crying. There are children that start to cry immediately you take the cane. “Eh, sorry ma, I will not do it again, Eh! Eeh,” shouting and screaming. Do not listen to those things. Do not drop the cane. A passer-by who sees a man correcting his child with a rod and says, “No, don't beat him,” is ignorant and not helping that child. God says the parent should do so to a child he loves. Tell God to take over from you when you have lost hope over your child.  **\n Philippians 4 verse 6, 7   **\n 6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.\n 7And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.   **\n If you will always commit the case of that tough child to God in prayer, you will be peaceful in your heart.  **\n4.5 Support your Spouse in the Work of Child Discipline  **\nThere is a difference between mother and father on this matter. One is always the disciplinarian. It could be the father that is the disciplinarian. Sometimes it is the mother. When it comes to the matter of discipline, you the second person (spouse) hold your peace. Since you are not the disciplinarian and the mother is now doing her job, a beautiful job, saying, “Hey! Come here child! Kneel down here! I say, Kneel down and remain there!” Let not the father say, “I am a merciful father,” After one minute you say, “Is it not enough? Tell him to stand up now. Stand up from there, your mother does not know the pain you are  passing through.” You do not know you are doing evil. Sometimes it is the father that is disciplining the child. The child knows that if his father comes in to handle him for his offense, it will be terrible. When he has done evil, a terrible one that his father will not spare, he will go to his mother and try to buy her favour, like saying, “Mummy, I want to wash your clothes. Mummy is there anything I can do for you?” He is trying to buy over his mother. He is bribing her so that when the business starts she will come and deliver him. There is a saying that goes thus, “The bird that calls for the rain, the rain will fall upon it.” That means the bird that calls for the rain will be beaten by it. The child has done a thing worthy of chastisement so he must be beaten. Control yourself and allow it to be done. It is a commandment of God. To resist it and fight one another is to fight against the word of God. Discipline is ineffective when you are not united.    **\nFirst Corinthians 1 verse 10   **\n“Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.”   **\nDo not split the children; some for the father and some for the mother. Be united! However, you can privately correct your spouse in case of ungodly anger and excesses in the punishment of children.  **\n4.6 Know that Children are Bound to be Foolish  **\n Proverbs 22 verse 15  **\n“Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.”   **\n Foolishness! Why do you think your child should know everything? God is even surprised at some of you. You tell your son, “Why do you not understand these things?” How would he understand them? “I try to make you understand these things and you are still doing them wrongly? Foolishness is in his heart. He says, “I thought when I do it this other way it will not bring trouble. I thought! I thought!” It is foolishness. That rod is called, “The rod of correction,” “the cane of correction,” “the whip of correction.” It is designed to correct. It will drive foolishness far from him and he will become wise. Anytime he is doing something, he will be careful. For example, you sent the child to go and buy something for you, he went and saw that they were acting drama in the television. Then he sat there and watched the drama to the end. You asked him, “What happened to you?” and he said, “Eh, on my way to the shop the money fell down from me. I took all the time looking for the money and then, at last I got the money. When I reached the shop, the man was not there, so I waited for him.” If you raise the rod and say, “Come here, you will receive twelve strokes now.” The following day will he do like that again? No, he will not.  **\n4.7 Disobey Ungodly Rules of the Government  **\n Acts 4 verse 6, 18 to 20  **\n6 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem. 18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. \n19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. \n20For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.  **\nThat is what the Lord is telling you. Unfortunately some Christian parents in the country where the Government tells them not to beat the children submit to the rules not knowing that Satan wants to get their children from childhood. The child belongs to you. If you disobey that Government, you are obeying the commandment of God and He will give you wisdom that will direct you on how to handle things. Faith in God and boldness will help you. If you beat your children with the rod when he is less than one year old, he cannot report you. By three years old when he begins school he will become used to the use of cane on him when he does wrong and will not see it an offense to report to the Government. Do not fear the government.  **\n\nPsalms 24 verse 1  **\nThe earth is the LORD'S, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.   **\n If the Lord wants you to stay in that land you will. He changes the decrees of kings. He changed it through Daniel. He changed it through Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego (people that were ready to jeopardize their lives for the God of heaven). The king bowed to God and pronounced the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to be worshiped and feared all over the world,   **\nDaniel 3 verse 28 to 30    **\n28Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent His angel, and delivered His servants that trusted in Him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their Own God. \n29Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill, because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort. \n30Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.   **\nUnfortunately, God does not have many courageous children that will give Him honor. Children He can act through in many nations. They are afraid and are submitting slavishly to the governments of their nations to their sorrow. **\n Jeremiah 10 verse 1 to 3  **\n1 Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel;\n2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.\n 3 For the customs of the people are vain.  **\nThe mind of God is clearly made known by this scripture  do not submit to vain customs and laws of the ungodly nations which are meant to destroy righteousness.  **\n 4.8 The Rod is Part of the Gospel of Jesus  **\nProverbs 23 verse 13, 14   **\n13Withhold not correction from the child,  for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die. \n14Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.”   **\nCan you see that the rod is part of the gospel of Jesus that can save a child from Satan and from hell fire? Using the cane is part of the gospel of Jesus. Do not preach only with the mouth to that child. Training involves the use of the rod. It will drive away Satan. It will make the child escape hell fire. That is what the word of God is saying. Do not mind, he will not die when he is beaten with the rod. \nSee the emphasis of the scripture, “Thou shalt beat him with the rod.” It did not say, “Thou shall beat him with the hand.” Be careful! Do not use your hand to destroy your child. Some children have gone blind by that. Some other children have gone deaf by that. The teeth of some children have pulled out by some wicked parents. \nDo not be full of anger when correcting your child, because anger does not follow any formula. Anger is too fast to follow a formula. “Where is that cane?” And you begin to beat anyhow. That way you are also passing a wrong training to that child to go and do so to his own children. It is evil. Ye shall use the rod. He shall not die and the rod shall drive away evil from the child and shall save him from hell fire. That is what the word of God is teaching us.   **\nProverbs 29 verse 15   **\n“The rod and reproof give wisdom  but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.”    **\nAre you getting some understanding? you are too lazy. You are always promising the child, “The day I catch you, eh! The day I rise up eh. The day I rise up eh!” Procrastinator! You are doing harm to yourself. As you rise and read the Bible, and pray, despite your tiredness, also rise up and beat the child when the child merits beating. Otherwise, shame is coming on you. Shame is going to be your portion tomorrow because you are not beating your child today. Also learn to give instruction, rebuke, and correction verbally to the child. Do this when he has done wrong. Do so in his good moments.   **\n Proverbs 29 verse 17    **\n“Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.”   **\n Correct your son and you will rest. The influence of the peer group will be broken with the rod. “I saw you with this boy, come here, and receive some strokes of cane. Turn your back.” “Mummy I will not go out with him again. Daddy, daddy, I will never go to his house again. I will never go there. I will never go there again eih, eih.” God says correct thy son and he shall give you rest. You have been talking, talking and talking and it is not working. You talk and talk, and it is not working, use the rod and he shall give you rest.   **\n\n\nCHAPTER 5  **\nASK GOD FOR WISDOM IN CHILD RAISING   **\nPsalms 119 verse 165    **\n Great peace have they which love Thy law,  and nothing shall offend them.  **\n Not all corrections require the use of a cane. Sometimes, some people, when the child is sleeping, will say, “I know how to handle him,” and start beating him right from his sleep. The boy jumps up from his sleep startled. He cries, “Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! Daddy what? Daddy what happened? Daddy?” It is wickedness! You did not tell him what he did wrong. If he did any he has forgotten. Such an approach may cause an emotional trauma to the child and hatred towards his parent.   **\n 5.1 Not All Correction Involve the Use of a Cane  **\nIf a policeman comes and handcuffs your hands, will you not ask him what happened? Why should it be your child that you will do that type of thing to? You have not told him what he has done and you just start to beat him. Will there not be  judgement day before people will be sentenced to everlasting lake of fire? The judgement is for you to be told your fault, the reasons why you are being judged and condemned. Does not the judge in the court tell the criminal his fault? Why then do you beat a child without telling him his fault? Will that not cause him psychological damage? You can have a wise child which just requires a word of instruction and reprove to perfect his ways. When you have a wise child that perfects himself by a word of instruction, why must you embarrass him with beating?  **\n Proverbs 23 verse 15, 19, 24 to 26   **\n15My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.\n19Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. \n24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him. \n25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. \n26 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.   **\nProverbs 9 verse 9, 10   **\n9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser,  teach a just man, and he will increase in learning. \n10The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.   **\n\nThe beating of your child must also be controlled. If the beating becomes so frequent, it will lose its value. Reduce the frequency at which your child is beaten so that it will not lose it value. Make sure the rate of reduction does not also affect the effect of beating your child. Do it appropriately. Don't make beating be the only way of correction. Also, employ verbal counsel or rebuke as necessary. Sometimes you can just arrange a meeting between your child and somebody else. You can invite somebody and say, “Tell my child about this thing. Maybe when I am talking, he is afraid and is not hearing me. Can you help me tell my child this, this, this and this?” It works! The child will listen to that person in love, in friendliness and understand, instead of, “Daddy I have heard, I have heard you. It is okay, I have heard,” while he has not heard anything. Wisdom is profitable to direct. Ask God for wisdom for child training. He will give you workable methods on each child.    **\nJames 1 verse 5   **\n“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and up braideth not; and it shall be given him.”  **\n 5.2 Love All your Children Equally   **\nDo not hate your child or treat him or her as if he or she is second class among your children. That will make the child harden his heart towards you. It will make the child also hate his siblings, because as far as he is concerned, “Mummy does not love me” or, “Daddy does not love me.” Yes, we see that Isaac loved Esau and Rebekah loved Jacob, but do not bring such a thing so openly to those children. Ask God to help you to love all your children, because God loves us all. If the children know that you made one a second class, you will also be a second class father or mother to them. Do not consider it a method of discipline to the child to deny that you are his father. It may destroy his attachment to you for training. Even if he is an adopted child show your love and commitment to love him and your deep concern for his good and success. If, for any reason, you bought a gift and you will not give him because he displayed stubbornness, tell him so. You are giving pieces of meat and you gave 2 or 3 to one child and gave only one to the other, give the reason.   **\nEphesians 6 verse 1 to 4.  **\n 1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord  for this is right. \n2 Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;) \n3 That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth. \n4 And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.”     **\nThe child does not know what to do, yet you are always accusing the child, always beating that child. Your eyes toward the child are as fire. The child will begin to think, “What happened? What did I do? If I did evil last week, when he corrected me, did I do another one? But what is the reason? Why is daddy always angry with me?” He will become angry with you and will make up his mind, “I know you hate me; do your worst!” So, please, be careful. Do not start beating the child for no reason. For no reason, no clear reason, you start mishandling the child until he begins to think that, “No! This is not my father,” or start wondering, “Was it this woman that gave birth to me? No! This woman hates me. I think this is not my home.” Do not provoke your children to anger. Be sincere before your children. Remember God is watching you and wants to see truth, righteousness and holiness of heart in you towards all your children.  **\n5.3 Do Not use Evil Words on your Child   **\n Proverbs 18 verse 21  **\n“Death and life are in the power of the tongue. He that loves it shall eat the fruit of it.” \nYou are always cursing that child! It is evil.  **\nRomans 12 verse 14  **\nBless them which persecute you, bless, and curse not.  **\nThe child that is stubborn today will be good tomorrow, if you give him attention. When you caught a fever and stomach ache that troubled  you for almost one month, did you not recover from it? What if you had destroyed that stomach? You would not have lived. Be patient with a stubborn child today. Tomorrow, the child will be good to you. Therefore, do not prophesy evil over your child. It is against God's word. Remember it is God that gave you that child and He has a purpose for the child. Why do you want to hand over that child to Satan? Do you not know that when you speak evil against him, you are commanding the evil spirit to take over him? Why are you handing God's child, which He graciously gave you, to Satan? Do not do that.  **\n James 5 verse 7,11  **\n7 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain. \n11 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.   **\nMatthew 5 verse 22   **\n“But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council,  but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.”   **\nMatthew 12 verse 36    **\n“But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.”   ** \nLuke 18 verse 7,8   ** \n7And shall not God avenge His own elect, which cry day and night unto Him, though He bear long with them? \n8 I tell you that He will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on the earth?    **\n 5.4 Sacrifice for the Welfare of your Children    **\nSacrifice for the welfare of your children in education, provisions and love. Love is sacrificial. Let your children see what effort you are making toward their wellbeing, else they will curse you. Many are cursing their parents today because they did not educate them. They did not provide job for them. If there is no money, let them know. Call your children and tell them, “It is not that I have the money and refuse to train you. You yourselves can see it. Let us bear it. Life is not only in education. You go and learn carpentry, you go for tailoring work, and you go for this or that. God will bless you. See this person; see that other person, did they go to school? It was handwork that made him great. He is now a leader in the society.” Speak good words, words of blessing. They will hold onto your words. It will give them encouragement. If anybody laughs at them, they will stand on your words. Deal in humility and  love with your children. Speak friendly to them. Make your children your best friends.   **\nRuth 2 verse 13    **\nThen she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.   **\nFirst Kings 12 verse7    **\nAnd they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.  **\n5.5 Learn to Play with your Children  **\nLearn to play with your children. Do not be the type that they run away from as soon as they see you coming. If they were playing, they stopped as soon as they see your coming. Everywhere becomes cold and silent because of you. Even the little child that was crying will try to muffle his cry. If you do like that, what is the difference between you and Satan? The child is afraid of Satan, he is afraid of you too. It will deprive the child of parental love. Some children live in torment in the house because of the fear they have towards their unfriendly father or mother. The Bible says   **\nFirst John 4 verse 18  **\n“There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear,  because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.”   **\n Perfect love casteth out fear. Why? Fear has torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love. If you keep your children always in dread of you they will not have real love for you. That dread, that fear will block real love and joy for their parents up to their old age, and it will be to your hurt. You will find your child leaving home and never bothering to call you. They may never bother to visit home because, they have never learnt to love you; you have been a threat to them from childhood. So, do not make your life frightening to your children. Be in love with them. Play with them in love.   **\nFirst Corinthians 16 verse 14  **\n“Let all your things be done with charity.”  **\n Mark 12 verse 29 to 31  **\n29 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord Our God is One Lord; \n30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength; this is the first commandment. \n31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.   **\n\n\nCHAPTER 6   **\nTRAIN YOUR CHILDREN BY GOD’S WORD AND PRAYER   **\n6.1 Lead your Children on the path of truth  **\nBe truthful to your children and lead them on the path of truth. Do not teach them lies. “Johnny, that man that is coming over there is coming to disturb me. When he comes and asks of me, tell him I am not around. Did you hear me?” The boy answers, “Okay daddy.” When the man comes and asks, “Is your daddy at home?” “My daddy said, I should tell you he is not around.” Very simple! You know when they are growing up they have the understanding of truth. Brush and improve the quality of the truth they have and let them grow in that way. Do not turn them into liars. Do not train them to lie.   **\n Second John 1 to 4  **\n1 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth; \n2 For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever. \n3Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.\n 4 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.    **\nTake note of the things you are saying concerning other people in the presence of your children. Your child will say so about others. A man of God came to the house of a sister and the woman gave the man of God rice to eat. You know rice and its behaviour. I think the spoon hit something and the rice scattered everywhere. When the man finished eating and left. The woman came with her daughter to clear the plates. As she was doing it, she remarked, “I don't like people who eat like monkeys. Look at rice scattered on the ground.” The child heard but did not say anything at that time. Sometime later, when she saw that man of God coming to visit them, she ran to her mother and said, “Mummy! Mummy! That man that eats like a monkey is coming.” The mother put foul language into the mouth of the child. The little girl has caught it and the mother stands guilty for teaching the child how to speak dirty language.  **\nEzekiel 16 verse 44    **\n “Behold, everyone that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.”   **\n If you want to speak about something sometimes, even good matters, it is better to excuse the child or keep it away from the child, because she is not old enough to understand such language. Her thought towards that matter will be childish.  **\nFirst Corinthians 13 verse 11    **\n“Because when I was a child I thought like a child, but when I became an adult, I put away childish things. Teach them to walk in the truth of God. That is what God expects of you.”   **\n 6.2 Pray Always for your Children   **\nPrayer! Prayer!! Prayer!!! To receive a child from God prayer is required. To keep the child in righteousness of God, prayer is required.   ** \nEphesians 6 verse 18   **\n“Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints.”   **\n Prayer generates power. Pray for your children. Pray for them one by one. The Lord will hear you.  **\nPsalm 3 verse 4    **\n“I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy hill. Selah.”   **\nPsalm 4 verse 3   **\n “But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself,  the LORD will hear when I call unto Him. “  **\nPray with fasting. Let the whole family pray.   **\nMark 9 verse 29   **\n29 And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.    **\nThe family can set a day, children day, to fast and pray for the children. The power of prayer on your child will make it impossible for him to be initiated by Satan. The enemy may try to do so, but it will not work; because he is committed unto God. If you suspect that your child has been initiated into witchcraft and you have been telling him to confess but he is not confessing, do not use force. Force will not do anything. Go to Jesus. A woman's child was tormented with a devil. She went to Jesus and said, “Lord Jesus, my daughter is lying at home, tormented with the devil.” She sought Jesus. She prayed, she cried, to Jesus, to “Have mercy.” She got the attention of Jesus and her daughter was delivered immediately. Get Jesus to deal with that demonic case of your son or daughter and you will have it done.  **\nMatthew 15 verse 22 to 28   **\n22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. \n23 But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and besought Him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. \n24 But He answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\n25Then came she and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me. \n26 But He answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.\n27 And she said, Truth, Lord;  yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.\n28Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.   **\nSettle it with Jesus, that demon shall vanish. Naturally all those properties will vanish from her. They will vanish from him. It is through prayer. It is not by beating him or threatening her with words, “I will pull out your eye.” God will not support that type of thing. The Lord has many ways to convict him and make him confess and be delivered. Trust in God. Call upon God. The Lord may do it Himself or lead you to others to pray for him. Hold on God firmly for the deliverance of your child.  ** \n Isaiah 49 verse 24 to 26  **\n 24Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered? \n25But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered,  for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children. \n26And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine  and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am Thy Saviour and Thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.   **\n Pray. Take time to pray and believe God.   **\n Matthew 18 verse 18    **\n“Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. “  **\nStand on the promises of God. It shall work. Bind the devil in his life. Loose him from his power. If your wife is in secret society or your husband is a wizard or any member of your family is in the kingdom of darkness, go and settle it with God, that demon will lose its power. You will rule over that matter. You will rule over that situation. Your prayer will handle it. It will incapacitate the devil.   **\nLuke 10 verse 17 to 20   **\n17 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through Thy name. \n18 And He said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. \n19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you. \n20 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.   **\n\nJob 22 verse 26 to 28   **\n26For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God. \n27Thou shalt make thy prayer unto Him, and He shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows. \n28Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee, and the light shall shine upon thy ways.   **\n Ask God what you want for your children. There is a woman that came to Jesus, but her prayer was wrong. Her coming was good and she said, “Lord can you answer my request?” He answered, “What do you want Me to do for you?” If she had asked for some other thing the Lord would have done it but she asked for a wrong thing. She said, “I want you to make my two children to seat, one each side of your throne in your kingdom.” This was because two of her children were disciples of Jesus Christ. Selfishness was inside her prayer.   **\nMatthew 20 verse 20 to 23   **\n 20 Then came to Him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping Him, and desiring a certain thing of Him.\n21 And He said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto Him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.\n22But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto Him, We are able. \n23And He saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of My cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with,  but to sit on My right hand, and on My left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of My Father.   **\n But as for you, what do you want in your child? If you pray according to the will of God he will hear you and it shall happen to your son. It shall happen to your daughter. Keep praying for their marriage. Keep praying for a godly husband for her. Keep praying for a godly wife for him. In case he is still in sin and is not born again and is in the age of marriage, there are differences in sinners; there are sinners that can repent easily and there are sinners that repentance is far away from them. Pray thus, “God choose for my daughter. Choose for my son. Guide him, direct him.” The Lord will answer your prayers. Pray for them in their schools.  **\n\n\nEphesians 1 verse 16 to 18.  **\n16 Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; 17 That the God of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him.   **\n\n\nChapter 7   **\nRAISING UP GODLY CHILDREN   **\n7.1 Child Training is the Responsibility of the Christian Society   **\nKnow that rising up godly children is not only the responsibility of the mother, the father or the immediate parents. Many people are involved in the duty of raising children. Jesus Christ said, “Anyone that receives any of these children in My name receives Me.”   **\nMark 9 verse 36, 37   **\n36And He took a child, and set him in the midst of them, and when He had taken him in His arms, He said unto them,\n37Whosoever shall receive one of such children in My Name, receiveth Me, and whosoever shall receive Me, receiveth not Me, but Him that sent Me.”   **\n If you can take a child to yourself and train that child for Jesus, you have done a great work. It is Jesus you have actually received and are promoting. Get a child and train that child. It is not only the responsibility of the parents, but of the Christian society where we all belong. All of us Christians, children of God, men and women of God have this responsibility to train the children, though the parents have the first responsibility.  **\nSecond Timothy 1 verse 5   **\n5 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.   **\nSecond Timothy 3 verse 15 to 17   **\n15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.\n16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; \n17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.”    **\nLook at these, from a child, Timothy was trained. By who? By Eunice his mother. Mothers, give attention to training your children. Fathers, give attention to training your children. Sometimes one of the partners is more available than the other or one is converted and the other is not. Responsibility naturally comes to you who is available, the converted, a true Christian, and the visionary among the parents. Train your child! Train your child!! Train your child!!! Teach the child the word of God. Lead that child to Jesus, whether it is by play or by formal approach. Whichever approach, take it up and do it.  **\n7.2 Be a Friend to your child    **\nMake friendship with your child to make his obedience to your word easy. But do not become too common to him, lest your word loses its power over him. Do not be too playful also, lest he will communize and ignore your words. From the training of the mother, Timothy got born again quite early in life. Lois gave birth to Eunice and trained Eunice. Eunice trained Timothy and brought him up in the way of God. I was told the mother of John Wesley had many children, about ten of them. She gave attention to the training of her children. Nine out of ten became great ministers of the gospel. The Lord is waiting for you to train your children for Him. He wants to use them. This is the endtime. He wants to pour down the Holy Ghost upon them to make them do wonders in this endtime. Give God children to use.  **\n 7.3 You Can Train Your Relations Too   **\nAgain, not only parents but family relations also can train the children for God. Mordecai trained Esther. Esther was a daughter to Mordecai's late uncle. So Mordecai took Esther to become his adopted daughter and gave her real training in godliness and righteousness. He that receiveth one of these little children, receiveth Me. And see what Esther did for God in her generation! Esther is an inspiration to us today. Why are you so selfish? There are some children of your relations that are wayward with nobody to care for them. Although you are to be careful not to bring in  Satan to your house to destroy it. Yet, there are those that you can reach with the message and salvation in Christ. You can pick them to raise them up for Jesus. One of your relations may be a Muslim. Why not persuade him that one of his children should come to stay with you? By this you may deliver a soul from hell. God will be happy with you that you have changed the future of that child and have delivered a soul from hell. There are many children going up and down, without parents or with poor parents, which you can help by the guidance of God.  **\n7.4 You can Adopt or Train Children in Orphanages   **\nOh! You do not have children? You can adopt one, two, three, four or even five according to your ability to give them proper training. “He that receiveth such receiveth Me.” If you do this you will be doing a good service for Jesus. You can have an orphanage where you gather all these homeless children to give them proper Christian training and you will be doing wonderful service for God. You can be a children teacher. With the presence of the Holy Spirit in your life, you can bring these children and teach them. You can go to churches and seek permission to teach the children. A particular brother said he went to teach in the children section of his church. He taught about hellfire. The children had never heard about that. They said, “Hmm? Hell? Where is it daddy?” They had never heard about hell. These churches assemble people and have nothing meaningful to teach them. Seek for opportunity to teach their children in the church service. Let them not be concerned with adults only because children do not have offering. God is their offering. Jesus is their offering. Gather them and give them training for theirs also is the kingdom of God. You will be doing wonderful service to God.   **\n\nCHAPTER 8   **\nTHE ROLE OF THE CHURCH IN RAISING GODLY CHILDREN   **\nGod gave commission to parents on raising godly children for Him. Each parent is responsible for this duty. But we must also know that the church is also commissioned to raise up godly children for God. The gospel commission given to the church includes this duty.   **\nMark 16 verse 15, 16   **\n15 And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. \n16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.    **\nThe word \"world\" could also mean people's group. Hence, the world of men; the world of women; the world of children; the adults that are in the church come to worship God along with their children. As the church seeks to make them know God, believe in Jesus and consecrate in holiness in order to worship God acceptably, even so must the church do to their children. This therefore means that a special attention must be given to the children to make them understand the gospel message clearly. The church will need the following    **\n(i) Communication Skill   **\nChildren should be preached to in the way they will understand so that they can believe and practice the gospel message.   **\nFirst Corinthians 14 verse 7 to 9, 11   **\n 7 And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? 8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? \n9 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.\n11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me.   **\n (ii) Children Teachers    **\nAttention should be given to train believers with the skill to teach children. These must not be the weak workers in the church but able men and women, born again and holy, with the vision and passion of raising children for Jesus.  **\n(iii) Effective Evangelism Materials and Teaching Aids    **\nThe church should provide required materials for children evangelism. These include books, videos and other materials that will guide the children teachers in their work. The parents also need these materials to occupy their children at home.  **\nFirst Timothy 4 verse 13, 15, 16    **\n13Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. \n15 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. \n16 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.   **\n Second Timothy 2 verse 15  **\n“Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. “   **\n(iv) A Good Children Church    **\nThe church should have a good worship place dedicated to children. This will provide convenience for the teachers and the children. A good accommodation provides effective communication, listening and control. Where public address system is required, they should be provided.  **\n(v) Special Program  **\nChurch evangelism and godly child raising should be given a good attention by the church. Hence as the church organizes various programs for the adults, so should the church also organize various special programs for the children to bring them to Christ and make them strong in the Lord.  **\nProverbs11 verse 30    **\n“The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise. “  **\n(vi) The Church Should Preach To and Teach the Parents    **\nThe church should preach to and teach the parents from time to time to awaken them to children training and to make them see the rewards of raising up godly children for Jesus.  **\nSecond Peter 3 verse 1    **\n 1This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance     **\n (vii) The Church Should Place Unfaithful Parents on Discipline    **\nThe church should place parents who are lazy and careless over their own children on church discipline to make them know the seriousness the Lord attaches to child training.   **\nFirst Timothy 5 verse 20,21   **\n 20 Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear. \n21 I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.   **\n Hebrews 12 verse 5 to 6, 11   **\n 5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him  \n6 For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. \n11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.   **\n (viii) The Church Should Organize Special Prayers and Intercession for Children    **\nThe church should organize special prayers and intercession for children's salvation, healing, deliverance, holiness and success. These should include prayer and fasting, and night vigil. These should be done regularly for the blessing of the children.   **\nMatthews 19 verse 13 to 15   **\n 13 Then were there brought unto Him little children, that He should put His hands on them, and pray, and the disciples rebuked them. \n14 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto Me  for of such is the kingdom of heaven. \n15 And He laid His hands on them, and departed thence.    **\n(ix) The Church Should Fight Against Witchcraft Activities and Initiation   **\nThe church should pay attention to demonic activities and children initiation among the children that are coming from children teachers and fellow children.  **\nProverbs 27 verse 23    **\n“Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.”  ** (x) Demonic Agents Among the Teachers and Children Should Be removed from the Fold to Preserve the Faith of Children.  **\n (xi) The Prayer Warriors of the Church Should Visit the Children From Time to Time to Prayer Over Them and to Handle Demonic Cases Among Them   **\nThe time the church of God should not only rely on the parents for prayer and home training of their children, but face children evangelism as a duty to make their children righteous and holy is now. Many of the parents are not born again or members of the church. Some parents also do not have the knowledge of truth to impact on their children. Some still cannot handle matters of initiation into witchcraft in their children. The church is vested with power and authority of Christ to set free the children from evil spirit. Let the church arise for this work.  **\n\n\nCHAPTER 9   **\nOTHER AGENCIES OF CHILD TRAINING   **\n9.1 The School    **\nThe school is an arm of child training, but not in the moral and biblical sense. It provides education to the children in various aspects. The school employs various kinds of child discipline to handle children and make them submissive to educational training. This contributes positively to good behaviours in the children. However, the governments of some nations instruct school authorities not to beat the children. Instead, they train the children to report their parents to relevant authorities if they beat them at home. This decree has weakened the efforts of many schools on the children. The school also has adverse effect on the behaviour of children because of peer group influence. Many bad boys and girls go about corrupting other children through friendship. Some children get initiated into cultism or witchcraft by their friends. Sometimes it is the teachers themselves that spoil the children through immorality and occultism. As a result of these and other reasons    **\ni) Parents must pray well to God for the appropriate school to send their children to for their spiritual safety.   **\n Ezra 8 verse 21 to 23   **\n21Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of Him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. \n22 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way,  because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek Him; but His power and His wrath is against all them that forsake Him. \n23 So we fasted and besought our God for this and He was intreated of us.   **\n ii) The parents reserve the right to withdraw their child from one school to another when they notice the evil influence of the school in the child's life. **\niii) The child must be well checked during parent's visit or when he comes home on holiday to ensure he is not into friendship with evil boys or gone into evil life of any kind.   **\niv) Wisdom requires the following from parents  As parents employ the service of part-time teachers to give supplementary lessons to their children during holidays or even when they are still in school. Christian parents who desire excellent performance of their children in spiritual matters should also give part-time employment to committed Christian brothers or sisters to teach their children the way of the Lord at home to supplement their efforts. The benefits of this to the parents are greater than those gained from excellent performance of the children in the school.   **\nActs 18 verse 26    **\n“And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue; whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.”  **\nv) School gives gifts to children to inspire them to greater performance. Similarly, parents should inspire their children to greater spiritual performance by challenging gifts.  **\nvi) Keep your child from being contaminated by children of neighbours, church members and relations. Evil children will influence your children in evil ways. Pray for good  friends for your children in the neighbourhood, in the church and at school.  **\nvii) You can arrange with a godly family relation or a friend for your child to be with his family for a holiday. Your child will be excited for this opportunity and will surely humble himself in the new environment. This condition will make him take with excitement all that they will teach him. May God grant you more wisdom as you ask Him always.   **\nJames 1 verse 5 to 7  **\n 5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n 6 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. \n7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.  **\n Proverbs 8 verse 1 to 5, 14   **\n1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? \n2 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. \n3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. \n4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.\n5 O ye simple, understand wisdom and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. \n14 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom, I am understanding; I have strength.  **\n\n 9.2 The Brotherhood   **\nFirst Peter 2 verse 17   **\n“Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. “   **\nHebrews 13 verse 1  **\n“ Let brotherly love continue.”   **\nWe are brethren in Christ, having the same Lord Jesus, the same hope of heaven and the same goal, righteousness and holiness. As brethren, we must exercise brotherly love towards one another, because we are admonished to love our brother as we love ourselves. Love does good towards one another and not evil. Hence, the Bible says   **\nDeuteronomy 22 verse 1 to 4  **\n1 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray, and hide thyself from them; thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.\n2 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.\n3 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's, which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise,  thou mayest not hide thyself.\n 4Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide thyself from them, thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.  **\n We are commanded to love one another. Love goes with good action to the favour of your brethren. We are encouraged, especially among brethren to help one another, protect one another and encourage one another. If your brother or sister in Christ has children that are wayward and you know what to do to help them out, seek to be of help to them by bringing solution to the calamity of their children.  **\nJames 5 verse 20  **\n“Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.”  **\n Where you can, you may do the following in love to assist your brother or sister in matters of their children   **\n I) Love the children and seek their godliness. \nii) Correct the evils you see them do, which the parents may not see. This is required of you by God. Do it in humility, love and wisdom.\niii) Report the evils of the children to their parents for their appropriate action.\n iv) Exhort and encourage the parents on godly child training.\n v) Give good Christian materials of edification to the children to encourage their godliness. \nvi) Pray for the children of your brethren or neighbours that the Lord may grant them salvation. \n(vii) Give good child-training materials to the parents and direct them to the right Christian assembly where they can have help.\n(viii) You can request for a child of a relation or a fellow brother to stay with you or you can adopt a child, just to train them up in the way of the Lord so they may become servants of God and ministers in His vineyard.  **\nEsther 2 verse 7,20  **\n7 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter,  for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter. \n20 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her, for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.  **\n 9.3 Orphanage home  **\n There are those that open orphanage homes for secular reasons. But believers can open orphanage homes to bring in abandoned or suffering children to raise them up for Jesus. This is done with a mind to protect them from evil and raise them up for Jesus. The Lord shall pour down His blessings abundantly upon the orphanage and the person doing this.  **\n Second Corinthians 9 verse 8 to 14  **\n8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work  \n9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; He hath given to the poor; His righteousness remaineth for ever. \n10 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)\n 11 Being enriched in everything to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God. \n12 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;\n 13 Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;\n14 And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.  **\n\n\nCHAPTER 10  **\nGOD’S PROPHETIC MESSAGE TO A MAN OF GOD AND HIS WIFE ON THEIR CHILDREN  **\nThe following message was sent to a man of God and his wife who both are serving God in Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide  \n“Tell My servant that I love his service for Me and I want to use him to do more for Me, but Satan is using his family to displease Me. Ask the Wife  Do you believed in the doctrine of holiness My son, Pastor Rika, teaches? If you do, why are you careless with the children I gave to you? Do you know that your children are mine? Why are you allowing your children to use those accursed things  hair attachment, jewelleries, trousers, etc. that can take them to hell?”  **\n First Corinthians 6 verse 9 to 11  **\n9Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, \n10Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\n11And such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. \nWhy do you not pity your children? I am speaking this to you, My daughter, as an act of grace to you in HOREMOW?  **\n Titus 2 verse 11 to 14  **\n 11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men, \n12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;\n13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\n 14Who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.   **\nYou are the one that supports those children to be the way they are due to your compromise. When you did not know this truth, your husband was hard on you because he wanted you to change. You too were stubborn against Me by refusing to remove those Jezebel properties on your body. However, I intervened by revealing the truth to you. Why do you not enforce this on them till I intervene, even if they resist it? It pains Me to see you and your husband pay little attention to enforce this truth on your children.\n I want you to know that My coming is at hand. I do not want your children to go to hell, considering the dedication of My servant, your husband, to My Movement, Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. Do you think the children are young? If nothing is done now, you will not find them in the truth tomorrow. You are spoiling them through your gentle dealings. You grant all their desires!\n My eyes are on your home where Satan has laid hand on your children to the bleeding of My heart. Your children are bleeding My heart. If you have given that house to Me, everything around you must be for Jesus. As long as they are in the house, they must comply to the standard. When they are away, they are free to live as they want, but not in your house.\n Carelessness on the character of the children made Me to judge the house of Eli.  **\nFirst Samuel 3 verse 12, 13  **\n12In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house; when I begin, I will also make an end.\n13 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.  **\n Your husband is pleasing Me and is determined to serve Me. I do not want him to ask Me in time to come why I did not save his children.  **\n\nActs 16 verse 31  **\n“And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.”  **\n My coming is so near. You make the children comfortable in all ways of life. Why supply their wild desires even to sinful things? Because of what your husband is doing for Me in My Movement, Satan wants to attack him as he did to Job. He is seeking to destroy his children. Do not tempt your husband to complain against Me. Your children are not fully under My coverage. Your daughter can dress like Jezebel and come to My house of worship and you do nothing about it? I want you to know that My desire is that people around you should know that you are not compromising. See My servant Paul Rika, his relations quake to come to him in their Jezebelic attires. They hide away these properties before coming to him. Although this is pretense, it is good to Me that My servant is hard on them. Now your children are believing that it is Pastor Paul Rika that is influencing their parents against them, because you are personally careless about their worldliness. \nYour husband is working among the youths for Me. Now youths all over the world are doing their spiritual assignment. How about your children? Are they following My assignment? Should he not be an example by his children?  **\n\n Titus 1 verse 5,6   **\n5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee; 6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.   **\n If you do not arise to handle them now, in your old age, you will be ashamed of yourself. In your eyes you will see them walk into hell. I appreciate the service of My Servant in My Movement, but the record is going under his name alone. Your sacrifice also is under your account alone, because your children will not inherit it.  **\nEzekiel 18 verse 4 to 5, 10, 13   **\n 4 Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine; the soul that sinneth, it shall die. \n5 But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 10 If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things, \n13Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase shall he then live? he shall not live, he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.   **\n I see that I am loosing your children. Woman, you do not love these children more than Me. Your children are purposely disobedient, yet their parents lavish money on them. Know that your money is Mine and you will give account of it to Me. My servant, do not waste your money to buy sinful things for your children. Do not use your money to keep them in darkness. Your money should be used to enhance people for heaven. Do not play with sin; be firm and disciplinary.  **\nGenesis 18 verse 17 to 19   **\n17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; \n18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? \n19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him.  **\nWhen the Lord was giving me this message for this man of God and his wife, I was confused. “Is this message not too hard?” I reasoned. Would they not say I am instigating them to hate their children? The Lord answered, “What do you mean? Is there hatred in this message? Do they prefer riches of this world for their children than heaven?”   **\n Mark 8 verse 36,37   **\n 36 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? \n37 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?   **\nThe Lord continues, “Ask the woman, How long have you been in HOREMOW? Are you seeing your children improving in the love of God year by year, by your gentle treatment?” The Lord continued, “because of your children, many are looking at you as a pretender. By the time they become adult, they themselves will be wild against you, because you are training them to love the world.\n Man, take back your authority over your children. If you love your children indeed. Save them now. The time of My coming is at hand.  **\nPhilippians 4 verse 5  **\n“ Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.”  **\nWoman, there are things you are allowing the children to buy that are evil. In the shops, they choose evil things  hair attachments, weave-on, trousers, high heeled shoes, jewelry, evil property of adornment and body ornamentation, and you buy those things for them! In a wedding ceremony you attended, your child was called upon, according to the programme schedule to deliver a wedding ring to the minister to fix in the fingers of the bride and the bridegroom. Can you say you \nwere not aware, before that event, of what your daughter was scheduled to do in the wedding, which thing I forbid?”  **\nRevelation 3 verse 19 to 22   **\n19 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten, be zealous therefore, and repent. \n20 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock, if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me. \n21 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne. \n22 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.\n",

As faithful leaders over the people of God in all areas of Christian service, including church finances, operations and management of assets, God expects you to give a true account to Him, and if required, to men also,   **\n Second Corinthians 8 verse 21    **\nProviding for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.   **\nRead through this book prayerfully, pleading for grace to practice the instructions and scriptural commands outlined in it.    **\nProper record keeping is an important activity in a holiness ministry. We shall look into the Scriptures to reveal accounts of recorded activities as a guide for your operation in a holiness ministry.    **\nAs one committed with Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide by God Himself, I desire that all Christian workers and ministers working with me in this commission be blameless and perfect so that they may qualify for eternal life and rewards. For this to be, I consider it necessary to write on this subject also   **\nMatthew 28 verse 20    **\nTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you  and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.  **\nColossians 1 verse 28,29    **\n28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus; 29 Whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.   ** \nThis book is written to enlighten all Christian workers and ministers seeking to serve the Lord in Holiness so that they may be protected from backsliding and corruption in the Christian ministry. May the Lord find your service good, holy, acceptable and rewardable by Him throughout your life time on earth, in Jesus name.   **\n\nCHAPTER 1  **\nTHE HOLY SCRIPTURE AND RECORD KEEPING   **\nThe holy Scripture is the book of God that shows the mind and work of God among men. It also gives us a clue to the works of God in heaven and in the whole universe. A look at the Scripture shows us record keeping in many ways among God's people. The scriptural accounts of record keeping include statistics that shows the number of people, family members, genealogies, number of firstborns, attendance at meetings, miracles, and all that the future may demand to know about the present and past times.    **\n1.1\tNecessity of Record Keeping as Historical Book of Facts    **\nIn the Scripture, records were kept of the following activities  the number of people that ate the five loaves and two fishes, which was five thousand men apart from women and children; the number of the apostles of Jesus, which was twelve. There were one hundred and twenty people in the upper room when the Holy Ghost fell upon them at Pentecost. Two persons were on their way to Emmaus when Jesus met with them. Two persons met with Jesus on the mountain of transfiguration  Moses and Elijah. So, we can see that the Scripture is full of records of events. The records of finances were also kept. We shall see from the Scriptures how diligent issues of finances and church properties were being kept and strictly persevered in the spirit of holiness.    **\nThe Scripture also kept the record of the marriage at Cana of Galilee and the miracle that took place there. These scriptural records were kept so that the future generations would know what God had done. Similarly, the record of genealogy of Jesus Christ was kept, tracing the birth of Jesus to Abraham to show that Jesus came into the world according to prophecy. Jesus was born of the lineage of David, to agree with the promise God made to David that, “Your seed shall be on the throne of Israel forever.” The Scripture also keeps record of the prophecies of God, so that we can watch their fulfilment and know those which are not yet fulfilled. Accounts of God's mighty works, miracles and promises have also been kept in Scripture.    **\n Exodus 17 verse 14    **\nAnd the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua,  for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.    **\nLuke placed on record the life and works of Jesus and His apostles for the people of his day and all future generations to know and believe. Apostle John also did the same.   **\n Luke 1 verse 1 to 4    **\n1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us, \n2 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; \n3 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 4 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.    **\nJohn 20 verse 31   **\n But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through His Name.   ** \nThere should be books keeping record of God's work in the church among God's people such as records of God's events, records of God's works and prophecies in the church, and records of the miracles that are being done. Indeed, there should be books of record for almost everything, including records of those who left the church and why they left. Records are necessary because tomorrow somebody may want to know about it or something contrary may come up concerning the past. Some issues may come up that may need going back to records in order to ascertain the truth. Although the key persons involved may not be in the system anymore, those books of record will tell the full story because record is a book of historical facts.   **\nEsther 6 verse 1 to 3    **\n1 On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. \n2 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. \n3 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.     **\nBecause of record keeping, the past good deeds of Mordecai came into remembrance and he was promoted by the king contrary to the plan of his enemy to hang him.     **\n1.2 God Keeps Record of His Words and Works for Posterity    **\nGod instructed Moses, “Say this in the hearing of Joshua, write it in a book.” This emphasizes the importance of record keeping.    **\nIsaiah 34 verse 16    **\nSeek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read  no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate, for My mouth it hath commanded, and His spirit it hath gathered them.    **\n From this Scripture we can see that the Lord keeps records, even of His own words, activities, prophecies and events. This is the book of the Lord, the Holy Bible, the book of His instructions. God instructed Moses to write down the instructions He was giving to the people lest they would forget. Human beings have so many things occupying their minds hence they can easily forget things. While it is necessary to forget certain things that would give us pains and fear, there are things we should not forget. Memory of some things is important to direct our feet to right actions. That is why we should have a book of record, to record and preserve vital information about events, God's promises and blessings in our lives. This will help our faith in God to grow and make us wiser.    **\nEzra 2 verse 1 to 2    **\n1 Now these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city; \n2 Which came with Zerubbabel  Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel.    **\nHere we see how diligently they were keeping record. Even when they carried people from Judah into captivity, they still wrote the names of the people that went into slavery. It is very important to them because the Lord had told them of the coming of the Messiah and they were diligent to ensure that nobody would claim messiahship who is not from the prophetic lineage of David. The children of Israel must not welcome any person into the tribe of Israel who was not an Israelite, and for him to be an Israelite his name must be in their book of record. So, even in captivity, as they were giving birth to children, they were writing their names so that nobody would claim to be an Israelite who was not one.   **\nThe Samaritans were rejected from being Israelites because, although some of them were actually Israelites, they had mixed with heathen nations after their deportation by a foreign king, who brought in strangers to dwell in their lands. They went into intermarriages and became mixed breed. For this reason, they were rejected. The Israelites said, “You are no longer full-fledged Israelites. We cannot accept you among us.” That was the contention between the Jews and the Samaritans. Their names were not in the register. This further goes to show the importance of record keeping.    **\n1.2\tRecord Keeping Helps the Work of God and Promotes Evangelism   **\n\nEzra 1 verse 1 to 5  **\n1 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying, 2 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and He hath charged me to build Him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. 3 Who is there among you of all His people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (He is the God,) which is in Jerusalem. 4 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that is in Jerusalem. 5 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem.    **\nWhen king Cyrus made a declaration for the return of the Jews, the elders rose up to supervise those to go to Jerusalem and they ensured that their names were in the book of records. It was not done carelessly but painstakingly to ensure that only those who qualified went. They declared, “Please, this call is not for everybody. Those to go to Jerusalem must be Israelites whose names are in the register. We will do verification on you.” They checked some people and refused them because they could not trace their genealogy. That is the beauty of record keeping. Good record keeping is part of the work of God. God is interested in this because through hearing the records of the good works of God, many people get converted. Yes, when they see the marvellous works of God, as a songwriter puts it     **\nO Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder **\nConsider all the works Thy hands have made   **\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder **\nThy power throughout the universe displayed ** \nThen sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee **\nHow great thou art, How great thou art **\nThen sings my soul, my Saviour God to thee,** \nHow great thou art, how great thou art.    **\nWhen Moses told his father in-law of the works of God, he acknowledged God. Just showing them.     **\nwhat God has done among men is sufficient to draw their hearts to God. Remember that the king of Israel called Gehazi and requested that he should tell him the works of Elisha. As he was recounting the miracle of raising a dead boy back to life, he saw the woman and exclaimed, “Ah! Look at the woman and look at the son that he raised from the dead!” You saw how that moved the king to do righteousness. True record keeping is very important. Some people don't keep accurate record; rather, they exaggerate. For example, a few people may be present in a meeting but they will give an inflated figure. That is how they do in some places. The Spirit of God is not there, because their records are not true. So, those who give false reports do not have the Spirit of God, because they are not true. God is not a liar.    **\n1.4 Good Record Keeping Blocks Off the Lies of Satan    **\n Matthew 1 verse 1 to 14    **\n 1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. 2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren; 3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; 4 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; 5 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 6 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; 7 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 8 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; 9 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias; 10 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias; 11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon; 12 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel; 13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakimbeg at Azor; 14 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achimbeg at Eliud; 15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 16 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ. 17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.   **\n\nThis Scripture traces the earthly history of the birth of Jesus Christ back to Abraham, because Abraham was promised the seed through whom the families of the earth would be blessed. They were able to trace Jesus back to Abraham because their records of birth were precise and well kept. They traced it to David also because the Lord had promised David, “I will give you a Son that will sit on your throne forever.” Jesus was traced to Adam through whom the seed of the woman was to come, to show that He is a Son of faith, a Son of promise.    **\nFrom the records, every Israelite would understand that this is the Messiah that the Lord had promised. He is the King that God promised would be coming. Good record keeping helps to erase confusion among God's people. The devil will not know how to come in. He will not know how to fabricate lies or distort facts. When he does his own, we will clearly know because it will not be in harmony with the records of God.    **\n1.5 Record of Miracles and Works of God Builds Up Faith of People    **\nJohn 6 verse 1 to 14    **\n1 After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias. 2 And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His miracles which He did on them that were diseased. \n3 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there He sat with His disciples. 4 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. \n5 When Jesus then lifted up His eyes, and saw a great company come unto Him, He saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?\n6 And this He said to prove him  for He Himself knew what He would do. 7 Philip answered Him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. 8 One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith unto Him, 9 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small fishes  but what are they among so many? \n10 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand. \n11 And Jesus took the loaves; and when He had given thanks, He distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.\n 12 When they were filled, He said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. \n13 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above unto them that had eaten.\n14 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.    **\nSee the effort it would have taken to count these 5000 men! Yet they needed the number, because it would help to show forth the glory of Jesus clearly. Many things have been done among us, but we did not give due attention to them. We did not record them, so they just passed away. Some gainsayers may say, “Show us the presence of God among you; where are the miracles of God among you?” There are many, but they are not being recorded. The Lord commanded the disciples to gather the fragments in baskets, and they amounted to 12 baskets! Wonderful result of record keeping! Now, how many loaves? Five loaves. How many fishes? Two fishes. How many people ate it? 5000 people, apart from women and children, who also ate. Altogether, there should be about ten thousand people.    ** \nThen the remnants or fragments that were leftover, which were gathered were twelve baskets. This was a miracle indeed! When the people saw this, their eyes opened more to know that Jesus was really He that was to come. So when the people hear or read the record of what you do, of what God has been doing, they will wonder and believe.    **\n1.6 Record Keeping of Events Promotes the Work of the Ministry   **\nEvery Christian ministry should have a record of her events, programmes and activities for others to see. For instance, how many messages has the International Director of Holiness Revival Movement preached to this date? We need such records. How many nations has he visited so far? Is it by his power? We need the record. During his missionary journeys, how many people attended his crusades or ministers' conferences? How many converts were made? These are very vital statistics. God is interested in these records.   ** \nThere are other records of events that a church needs to keep such as  attendance at Sunday service; attendance at Bible Study; attendance at Chapter or Unit meetings and messages preached. By analyzing the messages, we will be able to know the areas of emphasis and areas of neglect. As you keep record of CD/DVD messages, you will be able to know a wide range of messages that cover various topics of the Christian life and ministry. You will know the ones to listen to and the ones those under you should listen to.    **\n1.7 Heaven Keeps Record of Daily Activities of Men on Earth   **\n Revelation 20 verse 11 to 15   **\n 11 And I saw a great white throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. \n12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened and another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. 13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them  and they were judged every man according to their works. 14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.\n15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.    **\nHere we see that books of record were opened as a witness against sinners. Without these, it would have been difficult to track and find details of the lives of individuals who would argued that their names are in the book of life because of their works. Everything would have been muddled up, making things difficult on the day of judgment. Taking a cue from this heavenly pattern, it is the book of records that helps us in ministry to check if someone is really worthy of promotion. We want to know how a worker's life has been and promote those that have been faithful and worthy of promotion. There may be people who appear okay today but with bad past record. We may need to check from records to know if they have truly repented.    **\nRecord keeping is required in statistics, finances, tithes and offerings, and attendance at meetings. We need details of the amount of money that comes in as tithes and offerings, how many people attended the meeting, how many men, women and children, how many visitors, what messages were listened to, and how many got converted. God needs all these details.     **\n1.8 Record of Assets    **\nRecord keeping helps in accountability, which is part of holy living. Proper records should be kept in all areas of ministry. For instance, the media department needs to keep records of how many messages that have been preached within a given period. There should be record and preservation of master CDs/DVDs in case of loses or accidents, so that there will be back-up to reproduce new copies. In this case, the devil will not succeed in wiping off some of the messages preached and recorded.     **\nAnother important area of record keeping is in assets of the church. All assets bought by the church should be recorded in the Assets Register. Such record will indicate date of purchase, description of asset, number of units bought, price and condition of the asset (whether in excellent, good or fair condition). This register will be regularly updated to provide up-to-date information about the status of church assets which helps to check abuses and misappropriation and theft. For example, a report was received about one of our ex-coordinators in Holiness Revival Movement who converted a vehicle donated to the ministry to personal use. He signed all the transfer documents without bringing other leaders in the Ministry into the picture. When he was leaving, nobody knew about the vehicle and he took it away. If, however, the practice of assets recording had been cultivated, the likelihood was that the vehicle would have been registered in the name of the Ministry and such conversion of Ministry property to personal ownership would have been averted. Let every asset that comes in for the Ministry be promptly and properly registered so as not to create a conducive environment for evil workers.     **\nSometimes, the asset could be a landed property. If the coordinator is the only one that knows about the donation of a landed property to the Ministry, it may give room to temptation of converting it to his personal property. Needless to say, such a situation affects holiness of the believer and will give rise to divine judgment in the future unless restitution is done. Therefore, keep adequate record of all the assets (buildings, machines, vehicles, equipment etc.). Keeping a detailed record of all assets of the Ministry is a panacea to theft and pilferage. Moreover, unless we keep such a record, how do we know how much God has blessed the Ministry?   **\nSimilarly, proper record keeping should be maintained on every project of the church such as building construction, purchase of land or building, salaries and allowances, repairs or sale of assets. Evangelism outreaches should be well documented to ensure that God's money are judiciously utilized. People being employed in the service of God must be of proven integrity; and even these must be properly supervised.    **\nRomans 12 verse 11, 17     **\n11 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; 17 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. \n2 Corinthians 8 verse 18 to 22    **\n18 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches; \n19 And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind  \n20 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us; 21 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. \n22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.    **\nCHAPTER 2   **\nRECORD KEEPING IS PART OF PERFECTING HOLINESS IN MINISTRY    **\n2.1 Where Satan Got Judas    **\nWe bless God that among all the disciples of Jesus, we did not hear there was anyone caught in fornication or adultery. Under the strict supervision of Jesus, they were able to preserve themselves in these respects. The sin that completely overcame one of the disciples was the love of money. Judas fell for money. While the remaining eleven disciples probably did not know about it, his backslidden state was not hidden from Jesus. Satan did not get Judas in immorality, but he got him in the area of money. In the same way, many of our brethren may be very clean in their relationship with the opposite sex and completely free from alcoholism, but not from corrupt money. Money is their master! Some may be aware of this weakness while others may not, because of their deceitful hearts.   **\nJeremiah 17 verse 9 to 11    **\n 9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it? \n10 I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings. \n11 As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.    **\n2. 2 Revelation On a Staff of Holiness Revival Movement Involved in Financial Impropriety    **\nA staff in the headquarters of Holiness Revival Movement, Abuja, Nigeria narrated a revelation he had. He had earlier collected money to order some equipment from abroad for use in the media department. He paid the money into his account to enable him make online payment. He could not strike a deal with the suppliers to enable him make immediate payment so he left the money in his account hoping to continue with the negotiation at a later date. Jesus came to him in a revelation after the money had stayed with him for three months. In the revelation, he saw himself writing an  examination along with some people, but what surprised him was that he did not write his name on his answer sheet. He wrote somebody else's name there! He did not realize this error until he had finished writing the examination and the invigilator came to collect his answer script. He pleaded with the invigilator to allow him write his own name on the answer script, but the invigilator refused saying, “You have already finished and submitted, so you cannot alter anything again.” After this, he found himself before a door at the hall where they wrote the examination. When a candidate comes to the door, the door would automatically open for him if he passed the examination. If not, the door would remain closed. He saw many people gathered at the door who did not pass their examination.    **\nAt this point, the Lord came to him and said,\n“Do you see those people? They did not pass their examination, and even you, did not pass your examination. The reason why you wrote another man's name on your paper was because somebody else will take your place and inherit your reward. You are working now for somebody else because you have not passed your examination.    **\nWhy did you not pass your examination? It is because there are some little things you are doing that have become hindrances to your success. Those crowds of people you see at the door are also believers. They are leaders, but they too did not pass their examinations because of those little things. That is why the door did not also open for them. It will require restitution. They need to come back to do restitution and clean themselves before the door will open for them to go through.   As for you, My money is with you. You kept My money in your personal account. Does it belong to you? My money has been in your account now for three months. Is it yours?” The brother replied, “Ah! But I am still thinking of buying the items.” Jesus replied, “You are still thinking?     **\nWhat if you had fallen down and died? Is your life in your hand? If you had fallen down and died, who would have known that My money was in your account? It would have gone! Return that money back to the office. Moreover, there are monies that remained as change in your hand when you bought things for My ministry but you kept them to yourself and spent them as if they belonged to you. My change remaining with you is My money, but you have been using them for yourself. These are the things that made you to fail your examination and the door would not open for you.”    **\nAs you can see, Jesus did not rebuke this young man for immorality. Not at all! Was he fervent in prayer? Yes! Was he committed to the things of God? Yes! Was he a wonderful preacher? Yes, but no heaven! Very subtly and gently, the devil pushed him and continued to push until his name was erased from the book of life. His name was no more there! It was in this same way Satan got Judas. Therefore, Christian brother, Christian sister, be careful!    **\nHebrews 4 verse 1    **\nLet us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.   **\nFirst Peter 1 verse 17   **\nThat the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ.   **\nHebrews 9 verse 31   **\n It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.   ** \nAs you work fervently for God, check on yourself to ensure you will not fall short and be condemned, and cast away on the last day. Employ the pattern of Apostle Paul in your ministry and work for God.   **\n First Corinthians 9 verse 26 to 27    **\n26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air; 27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.    **\n2.3 Judas Was a Thief    **\nJohn 12 verse 1 to 8    **\n1 Then Jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom He raised from the dead. \n2 There they made Him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with Him.\n 3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of  Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. \n4 Then saith one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray Him, \n5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?\n 6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.\n 7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone, against the day of My burying hath she kept this. 8 For the poor always ye have with you; but Me ye have not always.   **\nFrom this scripture, we can see that the reasoning of Judas was corrupt because he himself was corrupt. It is obvious that he had been converting Ministry money into personal use in the past, for verse six says, “This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.” The motive of his disagreement with what Mary did was that, if the expensive oil was sold and the money was brought into the purse, more money would be available for him to steal. He wanted money to flow in a way that it would be easy for him to pilfer without anybody knowing. Such people would always resist essential work of God if it cannot be executed in a way that would profit them. They will always disagree saying, “No, no, no, why are you putting the money there? We need the money here.” All these is to provide opportunity for them to go behind and siphon the money without anybody being aware. Why was he angry? Why was he debating with Jesus? Judas must have succeeded in influencing the other disciples with his corrupt conviction, because their reaction was not different when a similar scenario played out in the house of Simon the leper.    **\nMatthew 26 verse 6 to 10    **\n6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, \n7 There came unto Him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on His head, as He sat at meat.\n8 But when His disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? \n9 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. \n10 When Jesus understood it, He said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon Me. 11 For ye have the poor always with you; but Me ye have not always. \n12 For in that she hath poured this ointment on My body, she did it for My burial. \n13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.   **\nJudas worked on them but they did not understand his motive. Jesus explained to them, “This is the priority area, not what you have in mind. They are using this money on Me and you do not have Me always. As for the other thing you are talking about, the opportunity to do it will always be there.” Judas said, “No, no, let's go for that other one, this one you have in mind can come up later.” Because Judas had the purse and was helping himself out of it, he saw opportunity for big money to steal – three hundred pence! What a great money at that time! As treasurer, he had the final say because Jesus was not prying on him. No Vetting Committee or any approving authority! And all will come to him eventually. The case of Judas here teaches us a lesson. Let there be checks and balances among brethren to discourage embezzlement and fraud.    **\n2.4 Some People Are In God's Service For Ulterior Motive    **\nJohn 6 verse 66 to 71   **\n 66 From that time many of His disciples went back, and walked no more with him. \n67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? \n68 Then Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. \n69 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.    **\nMany of Jesus' followers were turning back because they felt that Jesus was too hard. The Lord asked the disciples if they too would like to go away. They replied, “How can we go away? To whom shall we go?” As some would also say, “How do we leave Holiness Revival Movement? It is here we have found the word of God. It is here our eyes have opened. It is here we have known the truth and have confidence of going to heaven.” They told Jesus, “We know that You are the Son of God and You have the words of eternal life. Where do we go again?” How many did Jesus address? How many were replying? Though Peter was speaking on behalf of others, Judas had another reason why he remained. In the place of eternal life, his interest was different. In the place of eternal life, another reason kept him there. We could see this from the response of Jesus that followed.   **\nJohn 6 verse 70 to 71    **\n70 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?\n71 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon, for he it was that should betray Him, being one of the twelve.    **\nWhy did this devil remain? Was it for eternal life? There is a benefit he is gaining in that ministry, as a disciple of Jesus. Whereas the disciples were saying, “Where can we get the word of God so pure as this, that we can be eating so freely and having eternal life so clearly set before us,” Judas was saying, “Where can I get cheap money like this again, where nobody checks me?” All the money is in my hand and I can build houses, buy anything and even show some kindness to people to give the impression of a holy life!” Judas with Jesus remained for a different reason.     **\nThis tells us that as holy as we are in this ministry, we still have questionable people. As for Jesus, there was a reason why He gave Judas a free hand. But for us, we cannot afford to do so; otherwise, the little money we have to manage will just vanish overnight and the work of God will come to a halt. One adventurous person will just come and clear everything. These are unrighteous people who are executing the agenda of the devil. If they are not checked, they will stifle the work and frustrate our ambitions and evangelical projects.    **\n2.5 What Will Some People Not Do for Money?    **\n In a mixed school of boys and girls, teachers on duty go round to check on the students in the hostel to ensure the students do not cross boundaries and move from female hostel to male hostel and vice versa. Sometimes they do their check in the dead of the night. Although the hostels are separated and well demarcated, you cannot rule out adventurous students breaking the barriers to commit immorality. In the same manner, there is need to constantly work on the leaders and workers in the ministry to keep them in check; otherwise, there will be financial leakages in the system and the work of ministry will suffer serious setbacks.    **\nMatthew 26 verse 14 to 16    **\n 14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, \n15 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver Him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. \n16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.    **\nJesus had lived with Judas for about three-and-a-half years. He was innocent, perfect, a miracle worker, a good man, a good teacher and a good comforter and he had the glory of God upon him. Yet, see what Judas did! What can these people not do for money? Who is the International Director of Holiness Revival Movement that they cannot despise on matters of money? Who is he that they cannot lie against for the sake of money? Imagine Judas! He entered into an evil agreement to betray his Lord and Master and to get him killed for a token of thirty pieces of silver, which is the price of a slave in Israel!     **\nIn the secular world, they sell human beings for money. They buy babies and pound them in mortar for ritual money. They cut off people's heads for ritual money. Even in Christian Ministry, money still leads people to do great evils! They become angry when a searchlight is beamed on them because they do not like to be investigated. Why would somebody be afraid of investigation if his hands are clean? Sometimes, they want to show some spirituality and utter sweet words like, “Bro, it is God that has been helping us. In fact, this heaven we must be there.” Hearing these sweet words, you will be looking at him as a perfect and holy man. But it is a ploy to shift your attention away from him so that he can go on with his evil deeds. On your part, you must not fall into that trap; rather, you should follow the truth and do what is right to protect the ministry of Jesus. Let it be said of you that you have fulfilled all righteousness.     **\n2.6 Remove Your Eyes from God's Money     **\nThe love of money is the fall of many ministers of God. Satan got Judas through money and his offence was great as the betrayer of Jesus. Today, many believers and ministers of God fall to the power of money. Satan entered their life and captured their soul through money.    **\nFirst Timothy 6 verse 6 to 12   **\n 6 But godliness with contentment is great gain. \n7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. \n8 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.\n 9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.\n10 For the love of money is the root of all evil  which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. \n11 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. \n12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.   **\nMoney has caused the fall of many, but as a child of God and indeed as a man of God you must remove the love of money from your heart to remain pure. But why do you run after money? To build a house? To buy a car or to do what? Do you know that godliness with contentment is great gain? If you have no money to pay your children's school fees, why not put your trust in the Lord, even if your children will have to be sent out of school because of your righteousness? Does that mean God has abandoned you? During the period of one year that your children will stay at home, if all of you keep crying to your Father in heaven, will He not hear? Is God no more in heaven? Will He not appreciate your righteousness? Will He not rise up and do something to honour His children?   **\nThe Psalmist says, “I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.” Why not go before God in faith and pray, rather than resorting to stealing to pay your children's school fees? Where is the blessing? Is it not the blessing of the LORD that “maketh rich and addeth no sorrow?” Are you not cursing your children by building their lives on a faulty foundation? Is that not a curse unto them? You, as a father, is the one bringing accursed thing unto them, by stealing God's money to pay their school fees? Have you not already set destruction on their path? Some of them may die and never finish school because of the weight of your sins on their lives. You make them children of the devil because you have consecrated them to Satan. He is the one teaching you how to get money for their school fees, hence they are his children. He is feeding them with poison and will eventually lay claim on them. Therefore, child of God, flee these things and maintain righteousness. Remove your eyes from God's money. Do not seek after it.    **\nRomans 2 verse 21    **\nThou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?    **\nIn the public service, it is common practice for people to device means of embezzling government money. They have mastered the various arts of devising ways of siphoning money. They would obtain approval and claim allowance for courses they did not attend because they are more interested in the money than capacity building, which would make them more productive to government. They bring fake invoices and receipts to claim money for stationery and assets they never bought. When they buy something, they inflate the price on the receipt in order to make extra money for themselves. They don't return any left-over money to government purse; it becomes their own. They convert government assets to their own and take them home. You must not bring that evil to the church. Never! Be sincere and true in all your dealings, whether or not somebody is seeing you. Remember that there is a God in heaven watching over your activities on earth.   **\nFirst Timothy 6 verse 6 to 9    **\n6 But godliness with contentment is great gain. 7 For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. \n8 And having food and raiment let us be therewith content. \n9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.   **\nLuke 12 verse 15, 19 to 20    **\n15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness, for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth. \n19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. \n20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee  then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?   **\nCHAPTER 3    **\nTHE NEED FOR DILIGENCE AND WATCHFULNESS IN THE MINISTRY   **\nChurch leaders and ministers must be diligent and watchful over God's heritage in the ministry. This includes both human and material possessions of the Lord. As leaders, we often assume that when people say that they are born again, they can be trusted and given responsibilities without any need to check on them. This trust may be misplaced a times. It is only God who knows the heart of man.   **\nJeremiah 17 verse 9 to 10    **\n9 The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it? 10 I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.   **\nThis is the reason why Jesus did not commit Himself unto men because He knew all men.    **\n John 2 verse 22 to 25    **\n22 When therefore He was risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.\n 23 Now when He was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in His name, when they saw the miracles which He did.\n 24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because He knew all men, \n25 And needed not that any should testify of man,  for He knew what was in man. We must learn from the Master and be careful.    **\nThis chapter focuses on some case studies of practical events in churches and other places for our learning, so that leaders may become more watchful and ensure proper record keeping in ensure proper record keeping in the ministry.   **\n3.1 Case Study of an Event in a Church I Pastored    **\nBefore I became the International Director of Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, I had pastored many Churches in Deeper Life Bible Church at different levels of authority. In one of the churches I pastored, it happened that one fateful day during Sunday service, tithes and offerings were collected by the ushers and I also dropped mine.    **\nAfter the service, we needed to buy something for the church so I called for the tithes and offerings. To my greatest surprise, the total amount they claimed to have collected was just about the tithe I paid. More shocking was the fact that another brother said he had paid a tithe that was even higher than mine. I was dumbfounded. I called all the ushers together and when I looked at their faces, they were all looking very innocent. I asked, “What happened?” One usher said one thing and the other said another thing. I said, “So with all the messages I have been preaching, we still have Judas here?” With this experience, I then instructed them that from thence forward, they should no longer take the tithes and offerings collected to the inner room for counting. I instructed them to be keeping them by my side at the pulpit after collection. My thought was that, that would be a solution to the problem. But I was quite wrong! In another service, we were in prayers (after tithes and offerings had been collected and put by my side on the pulpit), but suddenly there was power outage that threw the auditorium into total darkness. It took just about five to ten minutes before the generator came up and the light was restored. Surprisingly, we discovered that one of the offering bags (with money in it) had disappeared from where it was kept! We found it some distance away from where it was kept. I think the sudden restoration of light caught the thieving usher unawares and he quickly dropped the offering bag and bolted away. Again, we asked who did it, but nobody owned up. That is what man can do for money!    **\nThis is the reason leaders must be very vigilant. 'Born again' is not on the face, just as they say “AIDS does not show on the face.” Let the ushers and people who handle money be proved before involving them in money matters. Those thieving ushers were not new converts, so it does not depend on how long people have been in the church. It is a matter of personal integrity.    **\nProverbs 27 verse 22 to 23    **\n22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him. \n23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.  **  \n3.2 Case of a Thieving Female Usher in A Church    **\nThere was this elderly female usher in a church in Sierra-Leone. She was a trusted worker, but nobody knew she was stealing from the offering bag. In the course of time, she got converted in Holiness Revival Movement (HOREMOW) and became convicted. That was when the truth came out. She had to go to the leadership of the church to confess and do her restitution. She pointed to a building and said, “That building you see standing there, I built it with church offering money. It is now for the church.” I built it with stolen tithes and offerings of the Church.  **\nEzekiel 3 verse 17   **\n Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel  therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from Me.    **\nWatch over all things! That is why the Lord has raised you up as a church leader and auditor and as a watchman over His work. You should not keep quiet but cry out. These people you see looking innocent may be going the contrary way. Check them to make sure the sin of Achan in them does not become a stumbling block to the progress of the church. Check these ushers. Adopt accounting procedures that will ensure one person is not allowed to count money alone, even if he is a trusted person. Put two or three people in charge of counting offering under good supervision. Let it be known that you did your best to check abuses.    **\nDo not allow anybody to cajole you with sweet words like, “Ah brother, are you suspecting me? By the grace of God, I was converted in 1975 and since that time, I have been consistent with the Lord; so you should know I cannot be unfaithful. If you don't know me, God is my witness.” Forget that language! Put that language aside and say, “Let us fulfil all righteousness, for two are better than one.” For righteousness sake, Jesus was baptized. Two people should count the offering and record it.   **\nProverbs 23 verse 12, 15, 16    **\n12 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge. \n15 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.\n 16 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.    **\nDon't Take People's Integrity for Granted   **\nSometimes, when offering is being collected, some people should keep an eye on it. They should just stand and watch. That is what they do in some supermarkets. As you go round shopping, one of the supermarket staff is discreetly keeping a close watch on you. He may just greet you, “Oh how are you?” Seeing them around you, are you not conscious that they will discover if you try any mischief? Sometimes, they even install cameras for surveillance. The Scripture says the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. In the church, we sometimes act foolishly. We take things for granted. We are not diligent enough. Though the people believed on Jesus yet He did not commit Himself to them, for He knew what was in man.    **\nMany Christian workers, members and ministers of the gospel commit sacrilege, robbing temples, robbing God. They rob the temple and make away with God's money, God's lands, God's buildings and other properties (machines, vehicles etc.). The Lord gave a revelation to us concerning the coordinators. He said “Tell them, whatever they buy must be receipted. It belongs to Me. I will judge them for everything, even up to the spoon they buy with my money.” Jesus' properties must be handled righteously because not to do so has grave implications.    **\nSometimes, people issue cheques in favour of the church for tithes and offerings. In such instances, you may find the church accountant persuading the member to open the cheque for encashment in the bank because of an urgent need for cash. The member might easily oblige because he believes he is dealing with a righteous man. The accountant may say, “Oh sister, this cheque you have given may be delayed because our bank is different from yours. Could you rewrite it and put my name there so that I can withdraw the cash from the bank to meet the church's urgent need.” The thought of the person who brought the cheque is, “I have met a righteous man occupying the seat of authority in the church.” Is she not dealing with the church accountant? Having achieved this, the accountant then goes to the bank to cash the money since it is now in his name. No record; the money becomes his own! He feels no guilt, because his conscience is dead. If the accountant is asked to lead prayers, you will think Satan is in trouble! Satan knows them – cheats and hypocrites. Since we have these types of people in our midst, we must rise up with wisdom to overtake them; otherwise, Satan will use them to impoverish the church.   **\n3.3 Case Study of a False Muslim Convert   **\n A young Fulani man came to our campground recently and narrated a sensational story. He said that he came from Warri, Delta State of Nigeria. He said a pastor invited him to Warri from Wukari in Taraba State to train him in Bible school, but when he got there he was unable to contact that pastor. All efforts to reach him by phone failed and he became stranded. He said he was lucky to find some good Samaritans of Igbo tribe (South East Nigeria) who accommodated him for four days. He kept on trying to contact the pastor until the money on him got exhausted. He said it got to a point that he had to sell his handset to sustain himself. He then began to seek for help to return back to Wukari. He was advised to join a 911 truck or an articulated vehicle (motor trailer) going to the north (possibly to Kaduna or Kano). This idea seemed good to him since it occurred to him that if they could just drop him in Abuja, he could seek for help at Holiness Campground, having once attended a conference there. This was how he found his way to the camp.   **\nOn arrival, he described one of our pastors in Wukari and said he was attending church there. He gave us the phone numbers of some brethren in Wukari that we could call for confirmation. We called the numbers and they confirmed that he actually fellowshipped there, but could not confirm the claims about his trip to Warri. We tried to reach the pastor in Warri, the one mentoring the converts from Islam, but there was no immediate response. I then released fifteen thousand naira (N15,000) to him to travel back to Wukari. Being a Fulani man, he was afraid to pass through Makurdi because of the problem there. He left the camp for the city, accompanied by a brother, to continue the journey the next day. After they left with the money, the pastor in Warri then called me back and I narrated the whole story to him. He laughed and followed up with a different story. He said, “I was the one that released transport money to him to come to Warri. Since I knew that their main problems are drug addiction and womanizing, I made sure I restricted his movements. This boy forced his way out because he needed to buy hard drugs. When he returned, I fortified the place the more and he revolted. He opted to go back to Taraba and went to some Muslims there saying, “Look at this person. He invited me to come here and wants to make me a Christian by force. Did I come here for Bible? Is it for Christianity I came down here?” The Muslim brothers there gave him money to return to Taraba State. He came to us in Abuja with a deceitful tongue for more money.    **\nBut this is the same person that was telling us, “I am a Christian, I am a Muslim convert.” Lying tongue! When I heard the true account, I called the brother that escorted him to the city, relayed to him the true story and instructed him, “Retrieve my money from him. Put him in a vehicle to Wukari, pay the fare and bring back the balance of money; otherwise, he will use it to buy drugs. Also let him know that we are now aware of the true story about him.” Thereafter, I called the pastor in Wukari and narrated the true story to him so that the brethren over there would know his true character as a deceitful and fraudulent person.    **\nPsalm 12 verse 1 to 4    **\n1 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.\n 2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour, with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak. 3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proudthings  \n4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own, who is lord over us?    **\nWhere do we find true leaders that speak the truth? These hypocrites trade in lies because the environment is passive and permissive. May the Lord give us grace to locate and flush them out in Jesus name. They falsify records to cover up their lies. They may get some money from the church and say, “We spent it for evangelism here; we spent it for evangelism there,” when in actual fact no evangelism took place anywhere. That is their life! They may harden their hearts like Judas who was not convicted even in the very presence of Jesus.     **\nWhen caught in the act, some will boldly and shamelessly say, “Do you know how much I have invested in this ministry? Is it because I took this thing that you are talking? Do you know how much labor I have put in here? How much are they paying me?” They use bravado to trivialize and justify iniquity! Some others steal by proxy, using others to perpetrate fraud. By the time it blows open, it will hardly be traced to them because they have painstakingly covered their tracks. They arrange it perfectly such that they will never be suspected or come under searchlight. Church pastors, account officers, treasurers and errand workers suffer these attacks in the hands of Satan. As a pastor, be careful with money. If you are a treasurer, be careful with money. If as an errand boy you are told, “Go and lodge this money in the bank, or go and withdraw this money,” be careful not to fall into the trap of the devil.     **\n3.4 Case Study of a Young Man Tempted by Satan to Steal Ministry Money   ** \nSometime ago when I was in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria, a young man collected some publications from me to sell in another state of Nigeria. They were sold on credit. Later I asked him to go and collect the money and bring to me. The amount involved was about fifty thousand Nigerian Naira (N50,000). When he returned, he told me an amazing story that shocked me. He said on his way back, a thought came to him, “Come down from the vehicle, go into the bush and injure yourself with a knife so that blood will gush out of your body. Then go and tell him that armed robbers attacked you on the way and collected the whole money from you.” He said he considered this thought for a while, but finally resisted the temptation.   ** \nAssuredly, I can tell you that this happened because money came into his hand and he was alone. When money comes into your hand while you are alone, Satan will begin to plant evil ideas into your heart to corrupt you. Generally, when you are sitting in the church hearing the word, you may not be thinking about any evil act, or money, or immorality. Never! It is when you find yourself with an opposite sex alone in a room, then immoral thought comes. With two of you in a secluded place, you may not understand how it will happen, (even though this may not be so with everybody). Your heartbeat increases and body language begins to pass message. If you are weak in this area, actions may follow. Similarly, if you are prone to money temptation, your thoughts will change as soon as money comes into your hand. The next demon that will visit you is the demon of lying, working together with the demon of carnal wisdom, all because of that money.   **\nFirst Thessalonians 5 verse 22 to 24    **\n 22 Abstain from all appearance of evil. \n23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. \n24 Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.    **\nIt is a dangerous thing to keep church money. You must be prayerful, otherwise as it did not help Judas, but took him irreparably far, it will do the same to you. That is the reason we say that treasurers should keep ministry money in the bank, not in the house lest Satan brings sickness in the night and the only solution to that sickness is God's money in your hand. Satan will also supply you sufficient lies to cover up your misdeed. This is the reason you need to be wise in this matter. Let the pastors help their people and as they help themselves too. People take God's money without following due process thereby falling short before God and men. Many have even forgotten how much of God's money is in their hands to their damnation. You must endeavour to be faithful in handling God's money, whether in your local church or in Holiness Revival Movement. Think through and if you remember you have misappropriated church money in the past, go and confess it and do your restitution.     **\nSome people are fortunate, as we have seen instances whereby, they died in this kind of sin and God sent them back to come and do restitution. But how many are that lucky? How many died and came back? Now that the Lord has said that He will judge you up to the spoon that you bought with His money, how much more the bigger things? Maybe you took a hymn book from the church, nobody is aware and it remains in your house. You must quickly return such items in your possession. If the things you took illegally have spoilt or have been used up, confess to God and your leader, and replace them in kind or in cash.   **\nCHAPTER 4    **\nBE YOUR BROTHER’S KEEPER   **\nIf a person thinks himself to be a pastor when there are evil records against him, he is only deceiving himself. If you think yourself to be a Coordinator, an Overseer, a Leader, when his hands are stained with God's money or property, he is nothing. This is the reality in our day. But how do we respond to this kind of situation? Those in church leadership who are faithful stewards of God must arise and cleanse the church of these corruption and defilement so that the presence of the holy God may return to His church,   **\n4.1 Gently Restore the Fallen Soldier of Christ    **\n Galatians 6 verse 1 to 3    **\n1 Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.\n2 Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.\n 3 For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.     **\nSurely many are wounded, many are defiled and many have been cast down. What do we do? We must take measures to carefully restore them. In doing this, we must be careful not to become an accomplice because they can make friends with you and give you part of the spoils of corruption to buy your conscience.    **\nYou want to rescue somebody that fell into a ditch, be careful so that he does not drag you into it. Restore him in the spirit of wisdom and meekness. Apply good methods. Do not go with judgmental attitude, “You are going to hell!” That way you will not be helping him. You have to deal gently with him. For example, you can say, “Oh my brother, I came to help you. Let us pray together so that divine help may come your way.” That is what God wants. If we don't do this, we are not helping them to recover. The door of eternal life may be permanently closed against them. This is what the scripture teaches.    **\nProverbs 27 verse 23    **\nBe thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds. \nJames 5 verse 19, 20    **\n19 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him; \n20 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.    **\nThere are people the Lord has given ministry in His vineyard, but they are not straight forward. The love of money and material things has overtaken them and they are being dragged to hell. It is our responsibility to know how they live. We must see that they are holy in service so that they may not labour in vain. Also, we should know how to reward those that are hardworking. Christian Leaders, and Pastors, be diligent to know the state of your flock. Some of those working with you are suffering from life-threatening sicknesses and you are not aware of it. For some, their sickness is spiritual yet you are not aware. As much as it is humanly possible, take measures to know about the wellbeing of your members physically, spiritually, emotionally and financially. Let it be known to God that you have tried your best. As you put in your little effort, divine support will come. Let every leader under you do the same with the flocks under them. Do your best to meet their needs. Always endeavour to speak lovingly and kindly to them. Pray for them and encourage them.    **\n First Kings 12 verse 7    **\nAnd they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.    **\nLeaders should also appoint auditors to check the records at regular intervals in order to promote accountability and integrity in ministry operations and finances. It is a wise thing to do in order to save people from being felled by Satan, for many have been wounded and cast down, and many mighty men have been slain by him. \n4.2 Put Honest Men in Charge    **\nSecond Corinthians 8 verse 16 to 23    **\n16 But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.\n17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you. \n18 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches; \n19 And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind  \n20 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us  \n21 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. \n22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you. \n23 Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you, or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.   **\nWhen it comes to matters of money, keeping of record, storage and distribution of necessities for the saints, and sharing of things, ensure that such tasks are assigned to honest men and women. As Pastors and Coordinators, emulate Paul who stayed away from money matters. While he shielded himself from it, he also ensured that he appointed honest and diligent men to do it, for he knew the evil of men. If you put the wrong man in charge, many things will go wrong. Therefore, Paul carefully selected people for the work. Again, he tried to show the people whom they were ministering to, that the people chosen were honest and sincere men.    **\nPeople we choose to minister on money matters should be proven men and women of trustworthiness and honesty. They should not be people of doubtful character. Choose people that are known generally to be of good report and high integrity. Like Paul said, “Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of God, but also in the sight of men.” Some people may want to say, “God knows that I am honest; God knows my hands are clean.” Yes, God knows, but let man also know, because God has given man the freewill to believe or not to believe, to receive you or not to receive you, to accept you or not to accept you. If you want man to accept you, give him the chance to prove you. Do not go with God's witness alone, let men also bear witness to your faithfulness!   **\n Second Corinthians 8 verse 21   **\n Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.     **\nNo man should say, “This amount of money came in, but I don't know what they did with it.” Anybody that is put in charge of resources, whether money or other material resources, should be able to give account of his or her stewardship.\n First Corinthians 4 verse 1, 2    **\n1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. \n2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.    **\n4.3 Promote Transparency in Ministry    **\nSome people want weekly inflow to be announced in the general assembly. While this is good for the conscience of people, wisdom is profitable to direct. It might also invite armed robbers to the church, because you do not know who-is-who in the church. On hearing it, somebody may start to say to himself, “So there is so much money in this place!” It may also bring other problems. Let everyone be persuaded in what he does. To avoid these troubles, it would be better to keep good records and share information on financial state of the church at executive meetings. The basic rule is to live holy and be clean in ministry, especially if you are under another man's ministry and you have to give account.    **\nIt could be that you are involved in a lucrative private business that is bringing good money to you and from your income you choose to buy some assets such as land or cars or send your children to elite schools to acquire sound education; if you do not keep proper record of ministry money that is put in your care, the tendency is for people to begin to say, “It is our money he is using to live in pleasure.”     **\nHow will you be able to convince them that it is not so, since you have no proof of a clean stewardship in your books of record? If this happens in a church, some members may stop paying their tithes saying, “Ah, I cannot continue paying my tithe there. I do not know how they are using our money.” Will you force then? Will you even hear of the complaint? You will just notice that tithe inflow is dropping and you will not know the reason. It is the tither's private decision and you have lost him. Let your work be transparent to all.    **\nFirst Timothy 3 verse 7    **\n7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.   **\n4.4 Adequate Supervision Reduces Incidence of Sin    **\nSecond Kings 22 verse 4 to 7    **\n4 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people;\n5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD  and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house, \n6 Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house. \n7 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.   **\nSome leaders can do well without supervision. This is very true because the Bible tells us the people whom Hezekiah made to repair the temple worked without supervision. They did not keep record of what they were doing, but they were faithful according to the scriptural testimony about them. But how many of such faithful men can you find today? If you find one faithful person, three are not. When the number grows larger it becomes even harder to find them. This is why checks and balances need to be built into the system to check widespread abuse. It is such checks and balances that will awaken some people from slumber and block others from tampering with Church resources.   **\nJohn 12 to 4 to 6    **\n4 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him, 5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?\n6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.   **\nSome people are able to oversee their female children as they grow up such that they do not go into immorality and get pregnant. Others do not have the commitment to do that. Let us train our children well, so that even when the devil tries to tempt them, he will not succeed. Satan will not be able to get them because they will resist him firmly. Who is the person that goes to excrete in a public place while people are watching? No one would likely do that. Who will go and undress a woman for sexual immorality in a public place while people are watching? Even if such a thought is in his mind, the environment will not allow it. Therefore, let us put in place adequate supervision and sin will lose its power.    **\nMost of these leaders have to be kept under watch, properly directed and supervised to keep them righteous and spotless. Otherwise, they will not be  preserved holy for heaven. They need to be helped to make it to heaven.    **\nFirst Timothy 6 verse 9 to 14    **\n9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. \n10 For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. \n11 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness. \n12 Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses. \n13 I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession; \n14 That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.   **\nHow many ministries have closed down? How many ministers have been chased out and lost their ministry because of fraudulent activities? They were doing it and eventually got caught. They thought nobody would ever catch them but they were caught. The love of money and immorality go together. When somebody has much money, he can use it to lure women and buy the conscience of members of the church. He may buy expensive gifts such as wrist watches, handsets, clothes and cars to win their love and loyalty. He has all the money and that opens the door for immorality and other things. The love of money is the root of all evil. Such persons use church money to build and furnish their houses, to feed and clothe their families, to pay their children's school fees and live in the pleasures of this life. It is just like the fraudster that brings bags of money home. A woman once said, “My husband brings bags of money home from diverse ungodly businesses and I am afraid to sleep in the house.”    **\nHelping our brethren to keep holiness demands regular checks, adequate record keeping and proper enlightenments on record keeping. Track all income and keep proper record of all expenditures. Put the workers through in proper record keeping and do not hesitate to correct and rebuke where necessary. We need to do this to keep them up and-doing. Teach them the standard and ensure that they keep to it. Make sure you do all these things according to the word of the Lord.   **\n4.5 Submit Yourself for Scrutiny    **\nSecond Timothy 3 verse 16 to 17    **\n16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; \n17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.    **\nReproof and correction are scriptural. Even where it calls for discipline, it is scriptural; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. He that wants to go to heaven will say like Job, “That which I see not, teach thou me and if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.” That should be your attitude as one that desires to go to heaven.    **\nHebrews 12 verse 14     **\nFollow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.   **\nIn a well-established church, there should be qualified accounting officers and auditors. This is necessary for this work to be done properly. The accountant keeps records of income and expenditure and auditors come in periodically to audit his books of record. The Auditor will check and confirm those financial reports and records and be sure they are accurate and reliable and that ministry assets are safeguarded. These things should be done in love and not for witch-hunting. A minister or Christian worker who desires eternal life and trembles at God's word must make himself and his records available for examination by other believers who are professionals in this matter. If you are a Christian leader and you want to go to heaven, you will readily say, “Come and check me; examine me and know my way; prove my heart and see if there be any wicked way in me.”    **\n Psalm 139 verse 23 to 24    **\n23 Search me, O God, and know my heart try me, and know my thoughts  \n24 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.   **\nThat is the prayer of the righteous, not that he will be angry and take offence when they investigated him. Why should he not be investigated to prove his righteousness? Even demons investigate believers. When the devil comes to investigate you, are you angry with him? Will he bother about your anger? Do you even know when he comes?    **\nJohn 14 verse 30      **\nHereafter I will not talk much with you, for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.    **\nJesus said “The prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me;” but as for you when he comes, will you be angry with him? Jesus was privileged to know that Satan visited often. When a demon leaves a man, he comes back to check whether the place is free again so that he may retake possession. So there is a check on you by demons. What is wrong if your brethren check on you? What is wrong if the leadership has instructed that your work should be audited or investigated? When they checked on Jesus, did they find sin in Him? Why not allow them to check on you and see nothing so that they can testify that you are a faithful man?    **\n4.6 Deal in All Honesty and Utmost Integrity    **\nSecond Corinthians 4 verse 1 to 2    **\n 4 1 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; \n2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.    **\nThis is a ministry you have received of God, so you have to renounced everything of dishonesty. Do not walk in carnal wisdom to make gain or to cover up your faults. If something gets spoilt in your hand, or some money in your custody gets lost and you cover it up, that is a fault. Is it your money? When you were given money to go and do something and it got lost, did you tell anybody? Did you bring it to light that the money got lost? Perhaps you could not understand how it got lost in your pocket and for that reason you did not see it necessary to report yourself, for fear of what will happen. That is still dishonesty.     **  \nMay be you ended up putting the money that got lost under miscellaneous expenses. Who are you deceiving? We must renounce hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. Let them judge you if you do evil that God may forgive you and never close His kingdom against you.    **\n4.7 Handle Ministry Assets with Care and Due Diligence    **\n How do you treat the properties of the ministry? Maybe as you were walking you stepped on a laptop and it got damaged, do you just come and say, “Hey! We need another laptop, another computer, the other one is spoilt.” How did it get spoilt? Did it spoil due to normal wear and tear or due to your carelessness? You may think, “If I tell them that it got spoilt in my hand they may ask me to replace it with my money.” Is it not better for you to tell the truth even if they will ask you to bear the cost of replacement? If God would show you mercy, they will not say so. But even if they penalize you, accept it as the will of God. It will serve as future deterrent and a reminder to you to practice diligence and righteousness on your way to eternal life.    **\nJob 34 verse 31, 32    **\n31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more; \n32 That which I see not teach thou me, if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.    **\nAll things work together for good for them that love God. Why hide the truth? Why withhold vital information? Maybe somebody gave a big sum of money as offering or donation, and you felt that if this money is recorded as income, they will think we have always been getting it like that, so you excluded it from your inflow in the monthly report you sent to Headquarters. That is unrighteousness. We are not to work in dishonesty or deceit but to practice righteousness in the sight of God and men. All these drivers that cause damages to church vehicles and fail to report themselves are not doing well. Maybe while driving the vehicle somebody hit them and instead of reporting the matter they quietly parked the vehicle and said nothing. They didn't realize that their going to heaven has been affected. Fear of the consequence has blocked faith, and whatever is not of faith is sin. Report yourself! The Lord knows how to handle your case. You can be forgiven. A man forgave someone that embezzled ten thousand talents. When Naaman gave Gehazi two talents of silver it required two people to carry it; how much more ten thousand talents? This is to show you how much money was forgiven a man. Why are you so afraid and think God cannot forgive you hence you have to be hiding your wrongdoing? Why are you so afraid to reveal even the immoralities you committed? Don't you know that God can forgive you? Even if there are chastisements, it will be for a while and you will bounce back. Can you see that carnal fear is the problem of your life?   **\nJeremiah 3 verse 12 to 14    **\n12 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause Mine anger to fall upon you,  for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever. \n13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed My voice, saith the LORD. 14 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you; and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion   **\n4.8 Let The Auditors Do Their Work Without Fear or Favour   **\n Allow the auditors to check your books without any obstruction or hindrance and to satisfy themselves in their probing. Let them ask all the questions they need to ask until they are satisfied, just like a Federal Road Safety officer will demand for your vehicle papers, driver's license, fire extinguisher, and caution sign until he is satisfied and tells you to go. Be ready to present your facts. That is what it means to work in perfection. Work in Holiness Revival Movement with a perfect heart.   **\nMatthew 5 verse 48    **\nBe ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.   **\nThe auditor appointed by the church to examine the financial activities of the church should do so without respect of persons, for the work is of God and not of man. The salvation of many and the glory of the Lord are in it. This work of auditing, going to check on people and records, is not man's work. Do not have the fear of man, for if you do, you will fail God. Suppose the Pastor failed God, would you as an auditor also fail God?   **\nDeuteronomy 1 verse 15 to 18    **\n15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes. \n16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him. \n17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's  and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it. \n18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.   **\nThe judgement is not your own. It is not for man but for God. The Lord is sending you because that man's name is already missing from the Book of Life. He is now using you to go and redeem your brother from hell. Love shall cover the multitude of sins. You are going now to cover it with the blood of Jesus by truth. Sometimes it is not easy, yet you have to do it. You are doing it for God. The Lord says, “Go and relieve My people oppressed by a backslider.” Did He not send Moses to go and judge Pharaoh to release His people from bondage in Egypt? Why should you be afraid when the Lord says “Go and save that man. Go and help him out of Satan's hand?” It could even be that that man has gone beyond recovery and he wants to do his worst before he leaves, and the Lord sends you to go and intercept him before irreparable damage is done; so that he may not be able to conclude his evil plans before he leaves. Instead of doing that, would you now become afraid of the man? You must pray for yourself, “God, remove respect of persons from me.” The anger of man means nothing, for the anger of man shall praise the Lord.    **\nWhen a police man is asked to arrest a person, does he fear his anger? He will simply announce, “You are under arrest.” If the person becomes too tough for him he will bring more policemen. If the matter becomes too much for them, they will use tear gas, until the person becomes weak and then they can arrest him and put him in handcuffs. In the same manner, you are sent forth as an auditor with the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord will give you boldness in Jesus name.   **\nIn Holiness Revival Movement, our Ministers should constitute Vetting Committees and appoint auditors. We desire earnestly to keep our ministers and Christian workers from being contaminated by money. We want them to be holy, spotless, heaven worthy, and be ready at all times. That is our prayer for them. May God help us to deal wisely and succeed in this area also in Jesus name. That is why we must collaborate to make sure righteousness dwells in this ministry. The unrighteousness of one man may affect the Ministry, hence we must fight against sin and corruption.    **\nAPPENDIX   **\nTHINGS TO REPORT ON BY HOREMOW CHAPTERS AND UNITS   **\n1. Assets acquired     **\nThey include  land and buildings, motor vehicles, motorcycles, public address equipment such as amplifiers, speakers, microphones; Generators, Television Sets, DVD players, Projectors, Pulpits, chairs, etc. Indicate the dates that these items were purchased or received as gifts to the church. The purchased receipts should be filed and it is important that a letter addressed to the Movement should accompany such gifts. For buildings, cars etc., there should be transfer of ownership documents.    **\nThe reports should indicate location of the assets and their condition, whether in excellent condition, fair or bad. The reports should show when any of these items is sold, damaged or given out. It is good that when expensive equipment is to be purchased or received as a gift, the leader involved should let his superior leader know.    **\n2. Financial Records     **\nTotal income in tithes and offerings collected, both during fellowship activity and outside fellowship activity are to be recorded. Note that personal gifts to the leaders or members that are specifically labelled as such are not part of the offerings, even when they are passed through offering bags. However, such could be reported as a separate occurrence where necessary. The financial reports should indicate pledges made and received. It is important for the coordinator to let leadership know of any substantial gifts received for personal use for acknowledgement.    **\nOfferings during programs should be counted by at least two people and appropriately recorded. Offerings and other collections should be lodged in HOREMOW accounts. The use of personal or individual accounts should be discouraged. Keeping cash at home should be discouraged except for imprest that is meant for running the fellowship activities. An amount in cash should be kept to serve as weekly or biweekly imprest to cater for financial needs and should be replenished from the bank. Proper accounts should be kept on the use of the imprest, and retired with receipts where applicable. Coordinators and leaders travelling for meetings outside their locality may collect cash advance for matters that concern the Movement and not for personal or family needs, and make proper retirement after the journey.    **\nFaithfulness is required in financial remittances at all levels  from units, chapters, states, groups and nations. Financial reports should be accompanied by bank statements of the period of reporting. The report should indicate charity given out, stipends or allowances taken or given, salaries paid to specified workers, rent paid for specified properties etc.    **\n 3. Report on Programs    **\nThe report should provide detailed statistics of attendance at weekly meetings such as weekly unit fellowship and weekly Bible studies, monthly chapter meetings and women meetings, bimonthly group of chapters or regional meetings and quarterly state or zonal combined meetings. The reports should indicate number, age group such as children, youths and adults, and gender to show male and female. There should be reports for special programs, crusades, outreaches etc. The reports should also indicate spectacular testimonies, special occurrences, problems and challenges encountered and other essential information.    **\nThe State, Zonal and National Coordinators are to write reports to cover visits of the International Director, whenever this occurs, and the report should be submitted within a month after the visitation. Note also that it is good to provide a day for counselling your members in your chapter.   **\n\n\nCHAPTER 5   **\nINSPIRED THOUGHTS ON SIN FOR SELF EXAMINATION     **\nIn your service for God always examine yourself by these 21 principles.   **\nA. COMMANDMENT AGAINST SIN   **\n 1. Do not commit sin.   **\n First John 3 verse 9   **\n Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him  and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.    **\nProve to yourself and others that you are a child of God, a true minister of Christ by staying clear from every kind of sin.    **\nFirst Timothy 5 verse 22    **\nLay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins  keep thyself pure.   **\n2. Do not hid sin.     **\nProverbs 28 verse 13    **\nHe that covereth his sins shall not prosper  but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.    **\nDo not hide your sin, in case you fall into it. Confess it to God and seek restoration in Christ immediately and do your restitutions where required. Also, do not hide the sin of someone else when God gives you the privilege to know of it. Follow the scriptural steps required for his conviction, restoration, discipline and purging of iniquity from the house of God.    **\nDeuteronomy 13 verse 8, 14;   **\n8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him;\n14 Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you; \nLeviticus 19 verse 17   **\nThou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart,  thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.   **\n3. Do not encourage sin.   **\n Exodus 22 verse 2    **\nIf a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.   **\n Do not follow the multitude to commit sin or encourage anyone to do evil against his brother and against God.   **\n4. Do not promote sin,    **\nActs 22 verse 19, 20    **\n19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee; \n20 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.   **\nDo not spread evil among men or in the house of God. As much as is possible prevent sin from advancing around you.     **\n5. Do not confess half sin.    **\nJoshua 7 verse 19   **\nAnd Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.    **\nGod knows the sin that has been committed. Confess it fully and hide no portion of it.    **\n6. Do not defend sin.    **\nLeviticus 19 verse 15    **\n15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment  thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty, but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.    **\nDo not honour or pity yourself or another and defend sin committed and requires confession or judgement.    **\n7. Do not refuse to judge sin    **\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 31, 32   **\n 31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.\n 32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.    **\nDo not refuse to judge sin in yourself or in others. Present judgment on sin keeps us away from sin and makes us escape eternal judgment after death.   **\nB. SIN IN YOU    **\n1. Sin In You Must Not Give You Rest Until It Is Gone.    **\nPsalm 51 verse 3, 4   **\n3 For I acknowledge my transgressions  and my sin is ever before me. \n4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight, that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.    **\nAllow the Holy Spirit to convict your heart of the sin you have committed. Do not harden your heart against Holy Spirit conviction over your sin.    **\n2. Sin In You Must Be Exposed.   **\n Psalm 32 verse 3 to 5    **\n3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long. \n4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me, my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah. \n5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.   **\nBe determined not to hide any sin in your life. Confess your sin in you life. Confess your sin to God and if required, to appropriate persons.   ** \n3. Sin In You Must Be Rejected.    **\nPsalm 97 verse 10   **\n Ye that love the LORD, hate evil, he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.    **\nHate sin. Reject it. Do not allow sin to settle in your life.   **\n 4. Sin In You Must Be Brought To Jesus    **\n First John 2 verse 1, 2    **\n1 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous  \n2 And he is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.    **\nLive your life without committing sin. In case you notice that you have committed sin, quickly run to Jesus and seek for forgiveness of sins and cleansing through His blood.   **\n5. Sin In You Must Be Destroyed.   **\n Romans 6 verse 6    **\nKnowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.    **\nThe body of sin you carry called the old man, the sinful nature, adamic nature should be taken to the cross with Jesus and be destroyed so that you will not be a servant of sin. \n6. Sin In You Must Be Replaced With Christ Righteousness.    **\nRomans 8 verse 2 to 4    **\n2 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death. \n3 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh  \n4 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.    **\nThrough the gracious experience of sanctification or heart purity in Christ the heart is rendered clean and holy and the believer is able to exercise full victory over sin.\n7. Sin In Temptation Must Be Resisted Firmly.   **\n Hebrews 12 verse 4    **\nYe have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.    **\nResist temptation to sin through persistent prayers. Resist sin steadfastly until you die or you are killed    **\nC. SIN IN OTHERS    **\n1. Sin In Others Should Attract Your Pity.    **\nPsalm 73 verse 18 to 20    **\n18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places, thou castedst them down into destruction. \n19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors. \n20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.    **\nDo not envy sinners because of their prosperity, progress and success or because they continue without being discovered or judged. Pity them because they continue without being discovered or judged. Pity them because of divine judgement and hell fire at their end. Surely it is not well with them now and it shall not be well with them for ever. \n2. Sin in others should attract your prayer.   **\n First John 5 verse 16    **\nIf any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death; I do not say that he shall pray for it.    **\nSin comes from the evil tendency in man and from the power of Satan over his soul. Pray that God may deliver him from this evil tendency and destroy satan’s grip on him. Pray that God will turn his heart to Jesus for his salvation. Confront satan in spiritual warfare over his life.    **\n3. Sin In Others Should Draw You Closer    **\nMatthew 9 verse 9 to 13    **\n9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom, and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. \n10 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples.\n11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners? \n12 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. \n13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice  for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.    **\nLook for the sinners, get closer to them, draw them closer in love and wisdom for the purpose of evangelizing them for Jesus. Get at the backsliders to restore them back to faith. Deal lovingly and wisely.   **\n 4. Sin In Others Should Attract Evangelism Message.    **\nIsaiah 58 to 1, 2   **\n 1 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins.\n 2 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.   **\nPreach the gospel of salvation and freedom from sin through faith in Christ to sinners and backsliders. Preach to them the message of repentance and restitution. \n5. Sin In Others Should Attract Soul-winning Methods   **\n Proverbs 11 verse 30   **\nThe fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.   **\nWisdom is the ability to select the right method that will work in evangelizing each sinner and backslider. Wisdom comes through prayers. Ask God for the right thing to do to save that person.    **\n6. Sin In Others Should Make You Spend On Their Salvation.   **\n Second Corinthians 12 verse 15    **\n And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.  **\nIt costs God His Son because He desired the salvation of human beings. It costs Jesus His Life for human salvation to be achieved. It must cost us money, time, energy, even our lives for the salvation of individuals, tribe and nation.   **\n7. Sin In Others Should Make You Despise Persecution For Their Salvation.  **\nActs 20 verse 22 to 24    **\n22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there; \n23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. \n24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.   **\n Persecutions will surely come on the way of soul winner and minister of the gospel seeking the salvation and holiness of the believers. But as Paul the apostle declares it, none of these things should deter us in our ministry for Jesus among men. Woe be on us if we preach not the gospel to save sinners, for fear of persecutions.\n\n",

      "body": "SCRIPTURAL MINISTRY OF A HOLY WOMAN**\nINTRODUCTION**\nMatthew 9 verse 37, 38   **\nThen saith He unto His disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborer’s are few; Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth laborer’s into His harvest. **\nI believe this book is out in this end time to answer the prayer of the saints, past and present, that God may send in more labourers to His plenteous harvest. The truths presented in this book will release many women labourers into the harvest field. We have examined women ministry in the Old and New Testaments to open the eyes of Christian women to the need God has of them in His harvest field. The scriptures that many have used to build tradition and doctrine against the women ministry have been examined through the grace of God and the help of the Holy Spirit. The key used in this book to get the right meaning of the scriptures many have misinterpreted is to let scriptures interpret scriptures. As the Lord set an open door before the church in Philadelphia for their righteousness and holiness, so also the door to full operation of Christian service of preaching, teaching, singing and others is opened wide to the righteous and holy Christian woman. **\nThis book is written also as a special letter to the leaders of denominations and Christian assemblies that inhibit the woman's ministry through erroneous interpretation and application of some scriptures. In the light of the truth stated here, it is required of them to let the women preach, teach or do whatever the Lord assigns them unhindered, as long as they do so in righteousness and holiness without usurping the authority of man over them. **\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1  **\nWOMEN MINISTRY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT  **\nThere are many traditions, confusions and restricted the woman's participation in spiritual activities to the point that the woman sits down doing little or nothing at all in the church. The ones that are zealous and love to do something are afraid whether they are sinning, going against the will of God or not. It is important to go through the Bible to see what the scripture has to say about the woman. The scripture has revealed the Lord's instruction concerning her in the Christian ministry. These are things God desires which the Bible actually says concerning the Christian ministry and the woman that some are misinterpreting. What is intended in this book is to make the Christian woman understand what the Bible is saying concerning usurping the authority of the man so that she can find her place in ministry and operate maximally for Jesus.  **\n1.1 The Woman  A Help Meet For Man  ** \nGenesis 2 verse 18 **\nAnd the LORD God said, not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.  **\nGod knew that it is not good that the man He has created should be alone. To match up with him, God created man for his purpose, worship, service and for the ministry. In this, God said it is not good that man should be alone. So He provided him a helper that will help him in order to achieve His purpose for creating man, whether those things are secular or spiritual  a helper should be with him to achieve these things. So the place of a woman is seen in whatever the man does from the beginning. As it was in creation so it is in recreation. As it is in the natural so it is in the spiritual.  **\nThe woman goes along with the man in all spheres of life to perform along with him that which God has commissioned him to do. In this case therefore, the Old and New Testaments will be considered to see the ministry of the woman in scripture. Did the woman take any public position in the Old Testament? Did she exhibit any spiritual function in public among the people of God? Did she have a ministry among men in the Old Testament? Let us examine some cases in scripture.  **\n1.2 Miriam the Sister of Moses  **\nWhile examining this case, we will want to bring out something which shall be understood better in the New Testament.      **\nExodus 15 verse 20, 21    **\n 20“And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. \n21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for He hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.''   **\nMiriam had a ministry which was a very prominent ministry among the women. Both men and women enjoyed her ministry. Mariam was a prophetess, a musician and a leader. Her leadership role was also enjoyed by men; and her prophetic ministry was not limited to women only but to all Israelites, hence the scriptural injunction that women should teach women does not limit their ministry to women only. As a prophetess, she was dealing with all. A prophet is one that gives God's message to His people. She was a prophetess sent by God to Israel and had a ministry among the men and women as well as Moses and Aaron       **\n Micah 6 verse 4    **\nFor I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.    **\nThe following scripture in the New Testament should not be misunderstood concerning the women ministry.      **\nTitus 2 verse 1 to 4   **\n1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine; 2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.\n3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;\n4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children **\nHere we see the older women commanded to teach the younger women. This however, does not mean that older women are to restrict their teaching ministry to the women only. They may also teach both men and women as the men do. The woman's ministry is not limited to women only. Miriam was a prophetess and received messages from God. She had a ministry to all. The woman minister ought to know that he has a ministry towards both the women and men, as the Lord gives the grace and an open door.     **\n1.3 The Sin of Miriam  **\nMiriam was rebuked by God for playing down on the position of Moses, the leader God appointed over Israel     **\nNumbers 12 verse  1 to 16 **\nAnd Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married, for he had married an Ethiopian woman. \n2 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath He not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it. \n3 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.) 4 And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out. \n5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forth. \n6 And He said, Hear now my words  If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream. 7 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.\n8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold, wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against My servant Moses? 9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and He departed. \n10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow; and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous. \n11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned. \n12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb.\n 13 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee. \n14 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again. \n15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days, and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again. \n16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran **\nFrom this scripture we find out that God gave Miriam a ministry but she wanted to usurp authority over Moses and God would not take that. Miriam wanted to terrorize or intimidate Moses, may be, because she was the elder sister. Not in matters of God! In creation, God put the woman under a man. The man was made the head of the woman. This authority is glaring in every respect in human society. It is so in marriage and family settings. The females in a family recognize the headship or leadership of the male among them when he comes of age. The society recognizes his authority and representation over the family above any female in the family. His elderly and younger sisters willingly submit to his authority and family headship. This is naturally expected of them by the society. God gives ministry to Christian women. But he expects them to give respect to men in the church. He will not take it lightly when a woman disrespects the men and behaves unruly among them. If the Christian woman can be humble, meek and holy she will go to any length in her Christian ministry, according to the calling and grace of God upon her. Eternal life will be her possession.     **\n1.4 Deborah the Judge.     **\n Deborah was another woman in the Old Testament that had a ministry. Israel had gone into sin and idolatry. This brought them under the slavery of an oppressive heathen king. Even when the Lord wanted to give Israel deliverance, none of the men were courageous enough to lead the people of God to victory. The men requested for and submitted to the ministry of Deborah.    **\nJudges 4 verse 1 to 9    **\n1 “And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead. \n2 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. 3 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD,  for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. \n4 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. \n5 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. \n6 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? \n7 And I will draw unto thee to the river KishonSisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand. 8 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go, but if thou wilt not go with me, will not go. \n9 And she said, I will surely go with thee, notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.”      **\nThe children of Israel had backslidden. All the men had become weak and fearful. None was courageous to lead the people to righteousness and victory. God gave a ministry to Deborah at this time. She judged Israel. That is, she made the people to know the righteous ways of God and showed them how to live in the fear of God. She was a prophetess. She delivered, preached and taught the Word of God to His people. The account of her ministry and dealing showed clearly that she did not usurp the authority of man. She recognized the leadership or headship of men over the women. By inspiration she called for a man to take the lead against the enemy. Note here that men recognized her divine authority in ministry and submitted to it. The matter is not who is in ministry, but whom has God placed His grace and anointing on. Deborah displayed humility and meekness, recognizing the place of man in her ministry. There was no abuse of power or disrespect for men. Her service and leadership was accepted happily and she accomplished her ministry to the glory of God. Deborah was a married woman who played her role well with her husband, according her love, submission, obedience and service as a wife. This is good in the sight of God. Let the woman deal gently with the men. Though the Lord has given her the calling and grace for ministry, she should exercise shamefacedness and sobriety, humility and meekness when handling or dealing with the men.   **\nIn Judges 5 verse 1 to 2 the Bible says    **\n1 “Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying, \n2 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves.” In verses 6-8 of the same chapter it says,\n 6 “ In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.\n 7 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel. \n8 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates  was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?''\nVerse 12 then says, 12 “Awake, awake, Deborah; awake, awake, utter a song; arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.”   **\nIsrael had sinned and the Lord sold them to the hand of king Jabin and the man oppressed them for twenty years. The highway was deserted; this implies that the people were no more following the highway for fear of their enemies. The men were so afraid that they stopped walking openly for fear of attack of the enemies.   **\nJudges 4 verse 6 to 8    **\n 6 “And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? \n7 And I will draw unto thee to the river KishonSisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand. \n8 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.”     **\nThis was the word of the Lord, but there was no courage in men. All the men were afraid. That gave room to the woman. First choice was given to the man but he failed. God looked for the second choice, put authority in her and use her to accomplish His purpose. Where men failed due to fear and cowardice, the women rise up as helpmate. Where darkness falls upon men, the light in the women shines bright.   **\n1.5 A Mother in Israel.   **\nSecond Samuel 20 verse 16 to 19 \n16Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee. \n17 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear. \n18 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel, and so they ended the matter. \n19 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel, thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel, why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?   **\nFrom this passage, we see that this woman was in the city where a stubborn man had run into. Joab the captain of David's army came in to destroy the city because of that man. But this wise woman in that city stood in the gap in wisdom to pacify Joab with her words and was able to save the entire city from impending doom. Only the stubborn person was destroyed instead of the whole city. A whole city was saved from destruction by the gift of wisdom God had given this mother in Israel. The gift of God in a woman can bring her to prominence in this life. A man's gift (women's also) makes a way for him and bring him before kings. The Lord gave this woman a gift. She told Joab, “I am one of those people, wise counselors, that give counsel to Israel. Have you come to kill everybody in this city? Then you will destroy a mother in Israel.” The gift God has given to a woman opens the door to her for ministry among God's people. It was clear that both men and women in Israel resorted to this woman for counsel.    **\n1.6 Humility In Women Ministers **\nThere is something that is noticeable in the ministry of these women  **\nJudges 5 verse 9   **\n My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD  **\nBy this declaration, Deborah did not raise herself above the men she led and who worked with her. She did not despise the authority of men. If she did she would have brought blemishes on herself. That would mean usurping the authority of men. Her ministry was run in recommendation and commendation of men. All were blessed and God was glorified. The wise woman counsellor in second Samuel 20 verse16 to 19 demonstrated this womanish humility in her ministry in the way she approached Joab (second Samuel 20 verse 16 to 19). Though older, she called herself his handmaid. With her sweet pacifying words, she was able to bring down the anger that was in Joab, thereby saving the city from destruction. We see in this women, humility, holiness and success in ministry.       **\nGod does not want the woman to think that she is higher or greater than the man. She must recognize the authority of man because it is given by God right from creation and He wants this to be maintained whether in secular or spiritual matters. He wants the woman to acknowledge this and not to behave otherwise, simply because she has certain gifts or calling.    **\nThe woman should know always that she is a subordinate and that it is God that has designed it so. She should not try to change the order as that will make her incur the wrath of God. She must remember always her position by nature and should not rush to sit on the throne over the man. As long as a woman understands this and submits to it she will do great exploits for the Lord with full honour and support of men.    **\n1.7 The Ministry of Prophetess Huldah   **  \nSecond Chronicles 34 verse 20 to 28      **\n 20 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying, \n21 Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found, for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book. \n22 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they spake to her to that effect. \n23 And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me, \n24 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah  \n25 Because they have forsaken Me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works of  their hands; therefore My wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched. \n26 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard; \n27 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest His words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before Me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before Me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD. \n28 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.   **\nHuldah was a prophetess which God used to bring a message of peace to king Josiah. As a prophetess, the Lord used her to bring great revival to Israel as a nation under king Josiah. We have in scripture the sure words of prophesy by which the Christian woman can bring salvation to individuals, families, societies and nations of the world. For the word of God says, “it shall come to pass that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and daughters shall prophesy.” It is God's word that gives salvation and deliverance. Everyone including the women is commanded to preach God's word all over the world.    **\nMark 16 verse 15 to 16     **\n15 And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. \n16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.   **\nThis commission is not only to the men, it is to the women also. The preaching of the gospel is for everyone, both men and women. Huldah got the word of prophesy as the Lord gave her and preached it to the men that came to her. The Bible tells us in     **\nSecond Peter 1 verse 18 to 21     **\n18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with Him in the holy mount. \n19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts; \n20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. \n21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God spakeas they were moved by the Holy Ghost.     **\nFrom this passage, we see that the prophecy in old time came to both men and women and was not subject to any private interpretation. The Bible is the more sure word of prophecy which is available to both men and women. Therefore, the women can prophesy through it by preaching the message of the Bible. Christ's commission to His followers gives the woman the authority to preach and teach the word of God to both men and women. That is the will of God for her life. It is the will of God for your life woman!    **\n Matthew 28 verse 18 to 20      **\n And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. \n19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost  \n20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.    **\nWomen are disciples of Christ as men are and are to obey the commission given to Christ's disciples.    **\n\n\nCHAPTER 2  **\nWOMAN MINISTRY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT  **\nWhen Jesus the man of Galilee went about ministering to people from place to place, the disciples were all men. The reason is not known, perhaps it is because of the risk involved. To go about with women about in ministry is risky, especially when mixed with men. Some of the women disciples were married and mothers of children and home keepers who cannot leave their immediate environment. May be these where the reasons why Jesus did not mix women with the men, being careful that His ministry be not abused. It is vital to say that women in ministry must be very careful not to abuse the gospel of Christ through zeal without knowledge. A particular woman minister came to Abuja, Nigeria, knowing no one and having no money. She said the Holy Ghost led her to the City to preach. She ended up lodging in the same room with a man, cooking and eating together. God surely did not send her or else she acted foolishly to her destruction. The woman must be disciplined. She must not waste her life. She must not go about recklessly in the name of ministry. She can easily fall into immorality. Promiscuous men can easily overcome her when she is unduly exposed. She must, therefore, be wise and calculate her ways. She must display the dignity of Christ's minister and purity of a true Christian woman. Seek counsel and be guided in ministry.    **\n2.1 Women Among Christ's Disciples **\nThere were women among the disciples of Jesus that served the Lord according to the grace given to them.  **\nLuke 8 verse 1 to 3      **\n1 And it came to pass afterward, that He went throughout every city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve were with Him, \n2 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, \n3 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others, which ministered unto Him of their substance.   **\nThese women didn't have the privilege to be going from place to place with the twelve. However, when Jesus ministered in places near to them or in the community, they would avail themselves to render service to Him and His disciples. This is a very important part of women ministry as we see in scripture. This is called the ministry of help. Women can do this, supporting the preachers, helping in whichever way the Lord gives her grace to help. The support and provision for gospel preachers is service to God. Many women are into this ministry. Men also operate in this ministry.    **\n2.2 Women in Preaching Ministry    **\nAnother thing we see in the ministry of the woman in the New Testament is preaching the gospel. The Bible says, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel.” When the Lord commissioned all people to go and preach and evangelize, women were not left out. They were also involved in announcing the resurrection of Jesus Christ. They went out and preached everywhere.   **\nActs 8 verse 3 to 4      **\n3 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. \n4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.    **\nHowever, this was done with decency; for God demands decency. Two women preachers appeared prominently in the ministry of Jesus Christ  the Samaritan woman and Mary Magdalene.    **\n2.3 The Woman of Samaria   **\nJohn 4 verse 25 to 30, 39 to 42     **\n25 The woman saith unto Him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ; when He is come, He will tell us all things.\n26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am He. 27 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that He talked with the woman;  yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? \n28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, \n29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did;  is not this the Christ? 30 Then they went out of the city, and came unto Him.” \n39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on Him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. \n40 So when the Samaritans were come unto Him, they besought Him that He would tarry with them, and He abode there two days. \n41 And many more believed because of His own word; \n42 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying;  for we have heard Him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.   **\nFrom this passage, we see that the woman of Samaria immediately received Jesus when she was convinced that He was the Christ. The next thing she did was to go into evangelism. Immediately she received the experience of salvation, she went about preaching to people. This is natural. It happens to everybody that encounters the saving power of our Lord Jesus Christ. The demon possessed man was authorized to preach Jesus after his deliverance and salvation.    **\nMark 5 verse 18 to 20        **\n18 ''And when He was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed Him that he might be with Him. \n19 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee. \n20 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him, and all men did marvel.    **\nI will go with you.” Jesus told him to go to his family and friends and tell them what the Lord had done for him. He began in Decapolis, about ten cities, going from place to place. This is natural for every person that gives his life to Christ including the woman. Women have the right to preach Jesus, His Lordship and what He has done in their life and in others to cause men and women to believe in Christ.      **\nThe woman of Samaria brought more people to Jesus through her testimony. The woman has the right to share her testimonies to all in all places including the church pulpit.   **\n2.4 Mary Magdalene    **\nJohn 20 verse 11 to 17         **\n11 ''But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping, and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre, \n12 And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. \n13 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him.\n14 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. \n15 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing Him to be the gardener, saith unto Him, Sir, if thou have borne Him hence, tell me where thou hast laid Him, and I will take Him away. \n16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. \n17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch Me not; for I am not yet ascended to My Father, but go to My brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father, and your Father; and to My God, and your God.”   **\nMary here, recognized the voice of Jesus and the Lord gave her a commission    **\nJohn 20 verse 16 to 18      **\n 16 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto Him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master. \n17 Jesus saith unto her, Touch Me not; for I am not yet ascended to My Father, but go to My brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto My Father, and your Father; and to My God, and your God.\n 18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her. \n19 Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. \n20 And when He had so said, He shewed unto them His hands and His side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.    **\n“Go to my brethren.” Can our God not give ministry to woman? Here, the Lord gave the woman a message to preach to men. The apostles gathered themselves together to hear her. Both formally and informally the woman has Christ's authority to preach. Both in crusade and in church setting the woman has Christ's authority to preach. The most important thing is the message and not the platform. Every woman should know this and stand before men boldly, but humbly without shivering and declare the message the Lord has given her. The woman committed with a ministry by the Lord should go forth in the name of the Lord and in His authority. The Lord commanded Mary Magdalene “Go to my brethren and say unto them.” This is a ministerial call and commission the Christian woman has received to preach the gospel in all manner, in all platforms, including the pulpit. She is free to use the illustrations and methods that will make people understand her. Mary was commissioned with a message to preach to the brethren in the “church.”    **\n“Where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there with them,” and that is a church. The woman can preach there if Christ gives her a message. The message given to Mary Magdalene was not a prophecy in the sense of the gift of prophecy. It was a direct instruction, “Go to my brethren.” His brethren were sitting somewhere. So in the church, the women can preach. The people can sit down and she be there to preach to them, because she has God's message and authority to do so. He that receives her receives the Lord and he that rejects her, rejects the Lord who has given her the message and the commission.    **\nMatthew 10 verse 40      **\nHe that receiveth you receiveth Me, and he that receiveth Me receiveth Him that sent Me.   **\nLuke 10 verse 16 \nHe that heareth you heareth Me; and he that despiseth you despiseth Me; and he that despiseth Me despiseth Him that sent Me.   **\n First Thessalonians 4 verse 8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us His holy Spirit.   **\n2.5 Prophetess Anna **\nThere is also the case of Anna, in the New Testament, who gave herself to prayer and intercession, serving in the temple.     **\nLuke 2 verse 36 to 38       **\n36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser  she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;\n 37 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day. \n38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of Him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.    **\nHere we see that she spoke of Jesus to all (men and women) that looked for redemption in Israel. She committed herself to prayers and intercession, with fasting’s for many years. Certainly, she encouraged many to be involved in this ministry. She certainly recruited and organised others to pray for God's revival in Israel. She saw this come in the child Jesus, which she had the privilege to curdle in her arms. Prayer and intercession is a ministry women can be encouraged in. The Bible says, “greater works than this shall you do” (men and women) “because I go to my Father.”     **\nJohn 14 verse 12;     **\nVerily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.    **\nThis promise is made to men and women in Christ.   **\n2.6 The Four Daughters of Philip the Evangelist   **\nActs 21 verse 8 to 9      **\n8 And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came unto Caesarea; and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him. \n9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.   **\nIn this scripture we see the four daughters of Philip prophesying. They all ministered to those in the assembly, both men and women. It was God that gave them a place in their father's ministry. They worked with their father to promote the work of God. Possessing the gift of prophecy they spoke in the church whenever God gave them a message.   **\n2.7 Women in Teaching Ministry **\nThere is also the teaching of the word which women could also participate in doing among the people of God. We must learn how to compare scriptures with scriptures in order to understand the mind of God.    **\nActs 18 verse 24 to 28,     **\n24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. \n25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. \n26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. \n27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace \n28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.”    **\nWe can see here that when Aquila and Pricilla his wife listened to Apollos they understood that he did not know much about Jesus, although he spoke zealously. The two of them got involved in teaching Apollos the truth about Jesus. Apollos would not forget their dual ministry over his life by the will of God. Through them Apollos became a useful vessel in God's hand. If women teach in secular schools what stops a well learned Christian woman from teaching in a Bible School and in the church? (Where two or three are gathered in the name of Jesus). There is no much difference between preaching and teaching. They both aim at communicating knowledge and understanding. If a woman is free to preach, what stops her from teaching? She is instructed to teach also.    **\nTitus 2 verse 1 to 5     **\n1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine; \n2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.\n3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; \n4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, \n5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.    **\nIf the woman is free to preach to men also as shown by the scripture, certainly she is free also to teach men. This scripture certainly does not limit her teaching ministry to women only. If we take this scripture literally without spiritual understanding, we will forbid the woman to teach children or youth, especially the male ones. So we see here that in whatever a man does, his wife is to follow him and help him. The scripture says He made the woman a suitable helper for man. A man with a teaching ministry who has brought up his wife in a good understanding of scripture, do no wrong to God to make his wife teach along with him in ministry.     **\nWhen the husband is doing the work of God, the woman is not to fold her arms and say I am just a woman. She is to help him in whatever way she can. The husband drives the car often, the woman also can learn to drive so that when he is weak or something keeps him away from driving, the woman takes over to help him keep the journey in progress.     **\n 2.8 Husband and Wife in Ministry **\nThere are many men of God today who have made success in the gospel ministry through employing the help of their wives in the ministry.  **\nFirst Corinthians 9 verse 5     **\nHave we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?   **\nPaul is saying here that Peter, James and Jude were married and went about with their wives to play their roles alongside with them in the ministry. The word of God says, “I will make a help meet for him.”    **\nGenesis 2 verse 18      **\nAnd the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.   ** \nAny woman that may function in the Christian ministry of her husband must be born again and humble in spirit. She must not usurp the authority of her husband in the ministry. She must maintain her gifts and calling.    **\nHowever, there are some ministers who use first Corinthians 9 verse 5 above to invite a single sister or a married sister to go with them for ministry in other places. You are a woman; a man is inviting you to go with him to a crusade and you agree to go with him all because he is your pastor. Are you, his wife? You should know you are going with him for immorality. God respects decency. That is why wisdom must be exercised in ministry when dealing with the opposite sex. Care and caution must be taken, otherwise you will become ministers of Satan. Let no woman allow herself to be abused because of ministry. Let the pastor go for that crusade with his wife and not a sister, except it is group outreach involving many. Let not your zeal in ministry be evil spoken of, neither give the devil a place. Heed the scriptural instruction **\nFrist Corinthians 8 verse 20, 21     **\n20 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us  \n21 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.    **\nIf the pastor's wife is not a believer or is indisposed, he must seek the face of God and counsel from true servants of God for companionship in ministry.  **\n\n\nCHAPTER 3  **\nSCRIPTURAL JUSTIFICATION FOR WOMEN MINISTRY **\nPreaching, teaching, praying or prophesying by women in ministry is justified by God according to the following scriptures **\ni)\tRomans 15 verse 4     **\n4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope **\nWomen ministry was practiced in scripture as we have seen. The woman ministry remains valid till this day. The prophecy of the scripture showed that godly women should be involved in the gospel ministry at the end time, which is our time. Hence the ministry we see godly women engaged in today is of the Holy Ghost, except those of unruly and godless women, which are known by their fruits.   ** \nii)\tJoel 2 verse 28,29     **\n28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions; 29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out My spirit.\niii)\t Acts 1 verse 8       **\n But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you  and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.    **\nThe Lord sent baptism of the Holy Ghost upon His sons and daughters to make effective witness (preachers, teachers, workers). Women also receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and are to engage in whatever ministry the Lord gives them for human salvation and the establishment of the saints   **\niv)\tCorinthians 12 verse 1 to 11      **\n1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. 2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. \n3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed; and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.\n4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. \n6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. \n7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.\n 8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; \n9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; \n10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues  \n11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.   **\nHere the gifts of the Spirit are given for ministry in the body of Christ. Christian women also enjoy these gifts by which they edify the saints. Signs follow woman's ministry in the name of Jesus.  **\nv)\tMark 16 verse 17 to 20       **\n17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In My name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;\n18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\n19 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, He was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.\n20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.   **\n\nThese things are seen practically among us. All these confirm that the woman has full access to the Christian ministry by the will of God. Signs and wanders follows the ministry in Jesus name. The Lord Himself works with them to confirm their word with signs following. This serve to justify the ministry.    **\nvi)\tMatthew 28 verse 19, 20       **\n19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; \n20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.    **\nThe instruction of the Lord in this scripture does not only involve preaching to sinners, but teaching the saints. Since women are included in the disciples of Christ, they are included in the commission to preach and teach the converts all the word of God.   **\nBy this commission, they have Christ's authority to teach men and women worldwide the gospel message and scriptural doctrines. If they do this faithfully, they will see the presence and blessings of Jesus in their ministry. Also contained in this commission is the commandment to baptize the converts in water in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Women ministers have the authority of the Lord to baptize the converts. Where the woman ministers do not baptize converts nor serve communion to worshippers, it is church or denominational doctrine that restricts them, not the word of God. The laborer in the Lord's harvest are few. Women believers are part of the laborer’s the Lord has recruited for His service.   **\nMatthew 9 verse 37, 38       **\n 37 Then saith He unto His disciples, the harvest truly is plenteous, but the laborer’s are few;   \n38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that He will send forth labourers into His harvest.\nvii)\tGod Is Glorified By Women Ministry In The Church And In The World.  **\nFirst Corinthians 10 verse 31      **\nWhether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.   **\n Romans 14 verse 4,\n 10 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up,  for God is able to make him stand. 10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. \n11 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God. \n12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. \n13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. \n14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself  but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. \n15 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. \n16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of;\n17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. \n18 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. 19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.  **\n\nRestrictions must not be placed on women in ministry. The disciples forbid children from coming to Jesus and He rebuked them for such unrighteous action. He wanted the children to come to Him and be blessed by Him. Similarly, let no man or denomination hinder the woman by tradition or doctrine from engaging in gospel ministry among the saints, be they male or female in the congregation. The Lord is unhappy with such.    **\nThird John 9 to 11     **\n9 I wrote unto the church, but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.   **\nThird John 1 to 10      **\nWherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words, and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.   **\nThird John 1 to 11      **\nBeloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God, but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.  **\nHebrews 1 to 1     **\n1 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets.   **\nHebrews 2 verse 1 to 4      **\n 1 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. \n2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward; \n3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard Him;\n4 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to His own will?   **\nGod speaks in diverse manners to His people. One of the ways He speaks to men is by vision or revelation. The Lord is indiscriminate in the choice of His messengers. He uses children, women and men to communicate His salvation message. Many of us are witnesses to the fact that God has passed great revelation messages through women to the church and the world in our generation. These revelation messages are scriptural and lead men and women to salvation, holiness and faithful service. Some of these revelation messages involve death or near-death experiences. These revelation messages quicken scriptural truths and doctrines which are ignored or forgotten by the church. Those who verify these revelation by the scriptures and believe them to be from God are revived, edified and established in the Lord. If God sends a woman with a message to you as an individual, will you not receive it? If God sends her to the church, will they not give her the platform to deliver it? Let the woman who has the word of God testify it, preach it, teach it, sing it for human salvation and entry into heaven.   **\nEzekiel 40 verse 1 to 4     **\n1 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me thither. \n2 In the visions of God brought He me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the south. \n3 And He brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate. \n4 And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall show thee; for to the intent that I might show them unto thee art thou brought hither  declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.    **\nRevelation 3 verse 22     **\n He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches  **\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4 **\nSCRIPTURAL CLARIFICATIONS **\n4.1 Headship  **\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 1 to 6     **\n1 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ. \n2 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you. \n3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. \n4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. \n5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head,  for that is even all one as if she were shaven. 6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn, but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.   **\nThis scripture presents three kinds of headship.    **\n4.2 The Headship of God over Christ.   **\n Although Christ is God and is one with God, He left His form of God in full glory and authority in heaven and came to earth in the form of man. He came as a servant, a messenger, and was called the Son of God. Hence, God who sent Him is His head Philippians 2 verse 6, 7. On earth He showed full submission to the Father. He sought the glory of God among men and not His own glory. He was obedient unto the Father, doing all that would please Him    **\nJohn 5 verse 30      **\n30 I can of mine own self do nothing; as I hear, I judge, and My judgment is just; because I seek not Mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.   **\nJohn 15 verse 10      **\n10 If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.   **\nJohn 17 verse 4      **\n4 I have glorified thee on the earth;  I have finished the work which thou gavest Me to do.   **\nThese texts show Christ's subordination to the Father.    **\n4.3 The Headship of Christ over the Man **\n Jesus Christ is the head of man. He is the Leader and Master over the man.    **\nEphesians 1 verse 22, 23      **\n22 And hath put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be the head over all things to the church,\n 23 Which is his body, the fulness of Him that filleth all in all.    **\n Ephesians 5 verse 23     **\n For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the Head of the church and He is the Saviour of the body.    **\nWe all submit to Christ. We seek not our glory, but the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. We obey Him without argument.   **\n4.4The Headship of Man over the Woman.   **\n Man is made the head over the woman. The headship of man over the woman is given in three respects **\n4.5 In Creation.  **\nWhen God created the man and the woman, He gave the headship to the man who was first created.  **\nGenesis 3 verse 16      **\nUnto the woman He said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.    **\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 9      **\nNeither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.   **\nIn civil matters worldwide human beings of all traditions have the understanding that man is the head of the woman.    **\n4.6 In Marriage and Family **\nThe God that instituted marriage and the family made it distinctly clear that the man is the head of his wife and of the family. The woman must be submissive to him and obey him in all matters that do not contradict the word of God.  **\nEphesians 5 verse 22 to 24      **\n22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. \n23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church and He is the Savior of the body. \n24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.   **\n 4.7 In the Church **  \nThis headship of man over the woman reflects in the church also, just as the headship of Christ over the man.  **\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 4 to 7      **\n 4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. \n5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head, for that is even all one as if she were shaven. \n6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn, but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. \n7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.  **\nBecause Christ is the head of the man, during worship (that is, praying, prophesying, preaching and teaching of God's word), the man should leave his head bare without covering it with a piece of cloth, cap or hat. His bare head should be seen. It is a physical symbolism of the presence and glory of Christ the Head, Leader and Savior. During this period also, the women should cover their heads with a material head covering to show in a physical sense that man is not in headship and his glory should be covered at such moment for man is the head of the woman and the woman is the glory of the man. To do otherwise as practiced in some places of worship is contrary to the scripture. However, the head covering by woman is not a thing to be done at all times and in every place. It is observed only during formal sessions of worship to God and in her prayers to God.   **\n4.8 Let the Women Keep Silence **\n First Corinthians 14 verse 33 to 40     ** \nFor God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints. \n34 Let your women keep silence in the churches; for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. \n35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home; for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. \n36 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only? \n37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.\n 38 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. 39 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.\n40 Let all things be done decently and in order.   **\nIn our study so far, we have understood by the scriptures that women are authorized by Christ to do the following **\ni)\tPreach the gospel as a disciple of Christ.  **\n Mark 16 verse 15     **\nAnd He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\nii)\tTeach the word of God to converts as soul winners    **\nMatthew 28 verse 18 to 20     **\n18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. \n19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost  \n20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you  and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.  **\niii)\tTestify of the works of God in their lives and in the lives of others in Christ.   **\nPsalm 107 verse 2     **\nLet the redeemed of the L0RD say so, whom He hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy    **\niv)\tSing in the worship of God in the church.   **\n Ephesians 5 verse 19, 20     **\nSpeaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; \n20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;   **\nv)\tProphesy  speak to men for their edification, exhortation and comfort  **\n\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 5     **\nBut every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with head uncovered dishonoureth her head  for that is even all one as if she were shaven. \nBut he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and exhortation, and comfort.   **\nActs 21 verse 8, 9     **\n8 And the next day we that were of Paul’s company departed, and came unto Caesarea and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him. \n9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.   **\n All these activities involve speaking and talking. Women have scriptural authority to speak in these respects in the church. By Comparing scriptures with scriptures, the meaning of scriptural texts comes alive and misinterpretations and confusions are removed.   **\nFirst Corinthians 2 verse 13     **\nWhich things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.   **\n4.9 Understanding the Text  **\nWhen we consider the full text where this instruction is given, we will see the following  \ni.\tGod is not the author of confusion, but of peace.\nii.\t Let the woman keep silence in the church \niii.\tIt is not permitted unto them to speak \niv.\tThey are commanded to be under obedience as saith also the law\nv.\t v. If they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home \nvi.\t It is a shame for women to speak in the church \nvii.\tThis is the commandment of God \nviii.\tThe women should not be forbidden to speak in tongues in the church \nix.\tLet all things be done decently and in order   **\nConsidering the scriptural rights God has given to the Christian woman to speak, preach, teach, prophesy in the church, we know that it is not in these respects  **\nFirst Corinthians 14 verse 34, 35 speaks of; for the scripture is not divided against itself. Hence it is not in these respects that first Corinthians 14 verse 34,35 says   **\ni.\tThe woman should keep silence in the church \nii.\tIt is not permitted unto them to speak\niii.\tIt is a shame for the woman to speak in the church   **\n4.10 The Problem Caused by Women in the Church   **\nWe see in the following statements in the text, the problem women caused in the church.  **\ni.\t Confusion among the brethren.\nii.\t Disobedience to the authority of men\niii.\tInsubordination to leadership\niv.\t Indecency and disorderliness.    **\nThese are acts of ungodliness that warranted the commandment given to women in this passage. This prohibition is definitely not the rule in every assembly. These rules are not unconditional. Where there is truth, righteousness and holiness in women, these rules certainly are not applicable. But in any congregation where the women are disobedient, unruly and exhibit insubordination and undue interference in the civil and administrative matters of the church, these rules apply. The woman's free and unhindered operation in the church requires her full commitment to scriptural truth and practical righteousness and holiness.   **\nSecond Timothy 1 verse 9, 10.      **\n Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless, for the ungodly and for sinners for unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,\n10 For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine.   **\nWomen like Deborah, Huldah and Priscilla will not need these rules to be set against them because they knew well the righteousness and holiness required of them and are humble enough not to underrate the authority of men. In a congregation where the women are not given to righteousness and holiness these rules must be applied to keep them from destroying the church through their carnal zeal and unrighteous interference. Many women get emotional and have not the courage to face issues of sin and rebellion in the church squarely as men do. This control is required over such to keep the church peaceful and righteous.    **\n4.11 I Suffer Not a Woman to Teach  **\nFirst Timothy 2 verse 11 to 15      **\n11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. \n12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. 13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve. \n14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.\n 15 Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.   **\nWe must again know that this passage is dealing with the case of the woman's disobedience, unruliness and insubordination to divine authority set over her. It is a repetition of the instruction given to the Corinthian Christians on the need to place control over unholy women. The passage above is analyzed as follows   **\ni.\t Let the woman learn in silence\nii.\t Let the woman be with all subjection \niii.\tI do not allow the woman to teach \niv.\tI do not allow the woman to usurp authority over the man \nv.\tBut she is to be in silence \nvi.\tAdam was formed before Eve \nvii.\tAdam was not deceived \nviii.\tThe woman was deceived \nix.\tShe brought the sin on Adam   **\nThis was why God allow suffering in childbearing   **\nGenesis 3 verse 16 Unto the woman He said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.   **\nx.\tHowever, she shall be saved in children \nxi.\tLet them continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety   **\nComparing scripture with scripture, we should know that the passage before us forbidding the woman to teach the word of God and commanding her to learn in silence is not an absolute and unconditional scripture. As shown already in scripture the woman has the right to prophesy  speak to others for their edification, exhortation and comfort. She is given authority as a disciple of Christ to preach the gospel inside and outside the church all over the world. One who is preaching often goes into teaching unaware because the two go together. As one authorized to make disciples, the Christian woman is also authorized to teach them to observe all things whatsoever the Lord has commanded in the scripture. She is also specifically commanded to teach Christian women on issues of righteousness and holiness.   **\nTitus 2 verse 3, 4   **\n3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; \n4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,   **\nSince the scripture does not contradict itself, we must seek to know what this scriptural passage seeks to achieve in the life of Christian women.  **\n4.12 Reason for the fall of Man in the Garden  **\nGenesis 3 verse 1 to 12     **\n1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? \n2 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; \n3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. \n4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die; \n5 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. \n6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. \n7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. \n8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day; and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. \n9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? \n10 And he said, I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. \n11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.  **\nAdam was formed in creation before the woman, Eve. The person who had the dialogue with the serpent was the woman. Satan feared he would not succeed in his ploy if he attacked Adam. He found some natural qualities in Eve that favoured his ploy. When he engaged her, he got her deceived and inspired to involve Adam in the disobedience. Hence she was responsible for the transgression. The cause being that she was forward. If she had understood and practiced subjection to the man the fall would not have happened. Man would have withstood Satan. In her ignorance she “usurped” the place of man and collapsed the human race. She suffered the judgment by the decree set upon her child bearing.  **\n4.13 Caution in the Church  **\nThe Holy Spirit would not allow this scene to be repeated in the church. The woman must be properly checked and supervised so that she does not bring sin into the church of Christ and damn human souls. To usurp authority means to hijack power, to seize authority. It means to stage a coup over the man and take over authority to lead and rule. This is evil. The “teaching” by the woman condemned in this passage carries the same meaning. It is something done contrary to godly authority. It is something done in stubbornness and pride, carrying no grace. It is a service of carnality done in contention and struggle against the man; that which the man is to do which is taken over by the heady woman. The authority of man in the church is hijacked by her. The leadership of the church is hijacked from man and she becomes the commander-in-chief. This must not happen. The woman must put on her shamefacedness and be sober in the church. She must recognize the natural headship of man, the divine headship committed to man and be in all subjection to the leadership of man over the work of God. This scriptural passage is better understood by the following scripture  **\nRevelation 2 verse 20 to 23     **\n20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce My servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.\n21 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not. \n22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. \n23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am He which searcheth the reins and hearts, and I will give unto every one of you according to your works **\nThe wives must not usurp or hijack the authority of their husbands in the family. Many women do this and ruin their marriage and family. This is an evil the holy Christian woman must not do.  **\nFirst Peter 3 verse 4 to 6     **\n4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. \n5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands; \n6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.  **\n4.14 Women in leadership  **\n First Peter 3 verse 7     **\n Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.   **\nThe woman must realize her frame and seek protection and covering by submitting to this instruction. She is said to be a weaker vessel. By nature some special qualities are built into her by God in creation for desirable service to God and to men. But Satan takes advantage of these qualities to deceive her, destroy her and use her to destroy others. There are some qualities men possess and service they can render that are peculiar to them. Can a woman be a leader, a pastor? Yes, as we see in Deborah, she was indeed a leader and a “pastor” but she sought covering from man. She was meek and humble and recognized the authority of men over her.    **\nJudges 4 verse 4 to 6     **\n4 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. \n5 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. \n6 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?    **\nJudges 5 verse 9      **\nMy heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.   **\nApart from submission to her husband for counseling and guidance, the Lord gave a Barak to stand with her. She was sufficiently submissive to man's authority, though divinely anointed. Similarly, Priscilla in the New Testament was submissive to the authority of her husband with whom she served in the ministry.   **\nThe world of our time appears to carry the characteristics of Prophetess Deborah's time. The devil has done great harm to men. Men have fled away from the presence of God. They are scanty in the church. They are given to the world and have abandoned the work of God. The Lord is giving ministries to women to lead the world and the church through the final repentance and revival before the rapture. Let not the way of the women be blocked by traditions and doctrines that are contrary to scripture. It is the Lord who has loosed the knots of scriptural passages many have used to deprive women laborer’s from entering into the harvest fields of their most loved Lord and Savior to reap fruit unto eternal life. Now with these scriptural interpretations and open door set before the holy women, let the women go into the Lord's harvest for the coming of the Lord is at the door! Amen.   **\nRevelation 3 verse 8     **\nI know thy works; behold, I have set before thee (woman) open door, and no man can shut it,  for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.    **\n\n\nCHAPTER 5 **\nTHE SCRIPTURES ON THE HOLY WOMAN AND HER MINISTRY **\n5.1 New Birth  **\nFirst Corinthians 5 verse 17,     **\nTherefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.\nThe woman who desires to serve God must be born again. She must show clear evidence of repentance and faith in the Lord Jesus. Her household and the people around her must attest to her new life and the righteousness of Christ in her.   **\n5.2 Sanctification and Heart Purity  **\nEphesians 5 verse 25 to 27,     **\n25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it; \n26 That He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, \n27 That He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.   **\nSanctification is a separate experience of grace required in one who is already born again. A woman who is already born again requires sanctification of heart or heart cleansing as a second divine touch.   **\n First Thessalonians 4 verse 3     **\n 3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication;   **\nBy this experience her heart is given a second cleansing by the blood of Christ and operation of the Holy spirit through the word of God, by which she is rendered holy and pure in heart to serve God and relate with men and women in the church and in the world unblameable.   **\n First Thessalonians 3 verse 12, 13;      **\n12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you; \n13 To the end He may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.   **\nFirst Thessalonians 5 verse 23     **\n23 And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\nPray earnestly and persistently for your sanctification which God gives to all believers who desire to serve Him committedly daily in righteousness and holiness all the days of their lives.  **\n5.3 Baptism with the Holy Spirit  **\nJoel 2 verse 28, 29     **\n28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out My spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions  \n29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out My spirit.   **\nActs 1 verse 8     **\n8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.  **\nActs 2 verse 14     **\n14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren   **\nHoly Spirit baptism is God's promise for His sons and daughters. The main purpose for baptism with the Holy Spirit as shown clearly by the scriptures is for the Christian service. The power received by this baptism works effectually in the believer and Christian minister to be more effective, fruitful and untiring in the Lord's business. Understand that those who are in Christ can be in ministry for God, but they become more effective, victorious, conquering and fruitful after baptism with the Holy Spirit. This baptism is evidenced by speaking in tongue by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. The promise of Spirit baptism was made for daughters as well as sons of God. Women in the upper room were also filled with the Holy Spirit. This is scriptural evidence that a woman can go into whichever ministry God has called her. Pray earnestly for baptism of the Holy Spirit for effective ministry in the body of Christ.   **\n Luke 11 verse 13     **\n13 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children; how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?   **\nAsk also for the gifts of the Holy Spirit for a rich ministry.     **\nHebrews 2 verse 4     **\n4 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to His own will?   **\n5.4 Christian Restitution  **\n Ezekiel 33 verse 14 to 16    **\n14 Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right; \n15 If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. \n16 None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him  he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live.  **\nMatthew. 5 verse 23 to 24    **\n 23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; \n24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.   **\nRestitution is the word used to denote the settlement of past wrong doings required of one who has believed in Christ. This involves apologizing to the owners of items one has stolen or appropriated fraudulently and returning those items unless the owner chooses to forgive the offender and says does not require them. Restitution also involves uncovering lies told and apologizing for them, confessing and ceasing from false documents results and claims. It is required also of a true believer to settle sour relationships in order to live in peace and holiness before God and men. Hebrews 12 verse 14, Follow peace with all and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord. \nSufficient prayers and counsel from true and holy men and women of God are required before carrying out some delicate restitution, especially those involving others who are still unbelievers.    **\nProverbs  11 verse 14     **\nWhere no counsel is, the people fall; but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.   **\n James 1 verse 5    **\nIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.    **\n5.5 Godly Dressing and Adornment     **\nRomans 12 verse 2     **\n2 And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.   **\n First Timothy 2 verse 4; 10    **\n4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. 10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.   **\nFirst Peter 3 verse 1 to 4    **\n Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; 2 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear. \n3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; \n4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.   **\nSecond Corinthians 7 verse 1     **\nHaving therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.   **\nGod demands holiness within and without from Christian women and men ministers. Perming, Jerry curling, hair attachment, cortex, lipsticks, jewelries, painting of the body, long nails, artificiality in adornment, weave-on and others in their class are filthy properties that defile a believer before God. Holiness demands that all these be removed from bodily dressing, including perfumes and the wedding ring. Trousers also called pants, short skirts, tight fitting skirts, blouses and gowns, see through dresses, low necks exposing the women sensitive body parts are considered the dresses of harlots.   **\nProverb 7 verse 10 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.   **\nThe braiding or plaiting of hair does not refer to the natural way some women keep their hair but rather to ungodly, fashionable and worldly hairdo practiced by women whose drive is beauty and advertisement of themselves before men. They are children of the devil following his evil designs and fashions. They are known by their fruits.    **\nMatthew 12 verse 33     **\nEither make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by his fruit.   **\nThe dresses of a holy woman minister must go well below her knees with enough allowance that they do not pull back in her sitting position. To sit down and your knees are seen is to display unholiness in the sight of God. Equally loathsome is when in your dressing your armpits or breast region are bare. The holy woman's dressing must befit her message before her audience.    **\n5.6 Chastity of the Unmarried Sister   **\nRuth 3 verse 10     **\n10 And he said, Blessedbe thou of the LORD, my daughter  for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.    **\nFirst Timothy 5 verse 2     **\n2 The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.   **\nThe single lady or widow in the Lord's service must keep herself pure and spotless. She must not corrupt her tongue or be corrupted by men because of money or careless living. She must not practice masturbation or lesbianism. Purity must be seen in her relationships and interactions.   **\nFirst Timothy  5 verse 2     **\nThe elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.   **\nHer marital procedures must be scripturally right and clean. The person she accepts to marry must be a true child of God, possessing evidence of salvation and well-spoken of by the believers. The courtship, dowry payment and marital consummation must be well supervised by the church and should be with the fear of God.   **\nHebrew 13 verse 4    **\nMarriage honourable in all, and the bed undefiled, but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.   **\n 5.7 Proper Marriage Union    **\nJohn 4 verse 16 to 18    **\n16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. \n17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband  \n18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband  in that saidst thou truly.    **\nRomans 7 verse 2,3     **\n2 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. \n3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.    **\nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 10,11     **\n10 And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband \n11 But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband, and let not the husband put away his wife.   **\nThe Christian woman must be in a proper and biblical marital relationship. The woman of Samaria got would need to get her marriage life corrected in order to continue with the Lord and serve Him. That would require scriptural guide and counsel of mature ministers to identify her lawful husband among the six men she had married. To continue in a wrong marriage relationship is to forfeit the Christian life and ministry. Illegal marriage keeps one in sin and death. If the husband is not converted, she is to remain with him in marriage, while doing her service to God, how much more when the husband is also in Christ. However, if there is a crisis that both her and the elders of the church cannot handle that warrants separation, she must remain unmarried or get reconciled back to her husband when the situation is under control.   **\n5.8 Headship and Head Covering   **\n First Corinthians 11 verse 3 to 7, 15   **\n3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. \n4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head. \n5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head;  for that is even all one as if she were shaven. \n6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn; but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. \n7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. \n15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given her for a covering    **\nAs Christ is the head of the man, even so the man is the head of the woman. The woman is commanded to cover her head with a veil when praying or prophesying to show that during spiritual worship of God the authority of man is not to be displayed, but that of Christ. Outside this formal spiritual activity, the woman is not under compulsion to cover her head with a piece of cloth or a head covering. This is because God has given her long hair which covers her head. The long hair on the woman's head is for her glory. The Christian women must not worship in the church or partake in a formal spiritual worship activity anywhere with her head bare. To pray or preach with your head bare is disobedience to the word of God.   **\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 10     **\nFor this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.    **\n5.9 Submission to the Husband   **\n Ephesians 5 verse 22 to 24     **\n22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. 23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the Head of the church, and he is the Saviour of the body. \n24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.   **\n Colossians 4 verse 18     **\nWives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.   **\n First Peter 3 verse 1, 2     **\nLikewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; \n2 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.    **\nWives are commanded in scripture to obey and submit to their own husbands in everything as the church obeys and submits to Christ. The headship of the husband, even the unbelieving one, over the wife, is compared to the headship of Christ over the church. The submission of the wife to her husband should be in the same degree as the submission of the church to Christ. The Christian wives should obey and submit to their unbelieving husbands to the point that some of them can become converted by observing the godly and unblemished life of their wives. However, the submission by the wife to her husband should be “as it is fit in the Lord”. Submission to the husband does not involve satisfying his sinful passions or obeying his ungodly demands and commands. The husband is not the owner of her soul but God and she is no where instructed to jeopardize her eternal life in order to maintain the earthly marriage union. As the three Hebrews children answered King Nebuchadnezzar, so must a Christian wife humbly but firmly answer her husband when he goes evil in demand and exercise of authority over her. The marriage relationship and its earthly privileges should be despised when the husband demands submission of the wife to his idols and Satan. God, is able to keep her in the marriage if he so wishes. She must not lose her soul to hell because of the fierceness of her husband. If God chooses not to preserve her in the marriage, she should be ready to terminate the marriage for the sake of her Lord Jesus and her eternal soul, not minding, whatever she may suffer.   **\nDaniel 3 verse 16 to 18     **\n16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. \n17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. \n18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.    **\n Acts 4 verse 19,20     **\n 19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. \n20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.   **\nActs 5 verse 29,    **\nThen Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.    **\n The Apostles in this way withstood the ungodly leaders of the Jews that intended to ruin the Christian faith.  **\n5.10 Conjugal Relationship    **\nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 1 to 5     **\n1 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me,  It is good for a man not to touch a woman. 2 Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband. \n3 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence, and likewise also the wife unto the husband. \n4 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.\n5 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.    **\nProverbs 24 verse 3     **\nThrough wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established  **\nProverbs 14 verse 1    **\nEvery wise woman buildeth her house;  but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.    **\nThe sexual relationship between the Christian woman and her husband must be treated with scriptural obedience and wisdom. The woman must seek to satisfy her husband so that she does not open door to the devil to frustrate her Christian life and ministry. She should know that fasting does not require ceasure of marital sex, except it is to be engaged in for many days. In case one desires to engage in long fasting, mutual discussion and agreement is required. Appropriate family planning method should be adopted to allow for the sexual relationship to continue. Soft and gentle words is required to prevent the husband from sex in times of tiredness, indisposition, sickness or genuine difficulties. The sexual life of the marriage must be sufficiently covered by prayer to keep the devil off from it. The blessing of the Lord should be sought upon it so it may bless the marriage with pleasures. Patience and prayers are required over some husbands in this area.    **\n\n\nCHAPTER 6 **\nTHE SCRIPTURES ON THE CHRISTIAN WOMAN AND HER MINISTRY  **\n6.1 Wisdom and Caution for Women Ministers     **\nFirst Corintians 7 verse 32 to 34    **\n32 But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord \n33 But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.\n 34 There is difference also between a wife and a virgin.  **\nThe unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit  but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.   ** \nTitus 2 verse 3 to 5     **\n3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; \n4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,\n5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.    **\nThe single Christian sister has abundant opportunity to serve the Lord to every extent. She does not suffer restriction due to a husband or children. She has all the time to pray, study, sing, attend programmes far and near, go for vigil, do marathon fasts, go for crusades and evangelism. She that is married should know that it is not expected of her to go to the extent the single sister goes. To do so is to neglect her husband and the household and make the name of the Lord a reproach. The Christian wife must satisfy all her obligations towards her husband, children and household. She must do all things so that even if the husband is ungodly, he will not have a just cause to hinder her from doing God's service. Christian women should know that the human society sees the women as weaker vessels and does not expect them to play “wild and rough” in ministry. The risks which Christian men can take in ministry in the society may have to be avoided by the women. Such may be permitted for the men, but not the women. Let the Christian woman submit herself to God and to those the Lord has brought her under that she may be directed and guided to a fulfilled ministry.   **\nPsalm 32 verse 8, I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go, I will guide thee with Mine eye.   **\nIsaiah 48 verse 17 to 19     **\n17 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go. \n18 O that thou hadst hearkened to My commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea;\n19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before Me.   **\n 6.2 Go into All the World and Preach    **\nMark 16 verse 15 to 20     **\n15 And He said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. \n16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.\n 17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In My name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; \n18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. \n19 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, He was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.\n20 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.   **\nThe woman is a disciple of the Lord Jesus and shares in the responsibilities of the commission or command given in the scripture. By the above scripture she is expected to do the following    **\ni.\tGo into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. \nii.\tBaptize those who believe in the Lord Jesus among them. \niii.\tHave signs following her ministry  speaking in tongues, casting out devils, taking poison without hurt, matching on serpents without hurt, laying hands on the sick and they will recover.\niv.\tThe Lord Jesus Christ works with women disciples who obey this command to confirm their words with signs following.  **\n If God leads a woman to raise her up in a community where there is no gospel, she should arise to obey the Lord's commission on her. However, a woman who is in an established church where men function should submit herself under authority and function as she is assigned without contention. A woman's gift will certainly make a way for her and bring her before great men    **\n6.3 Teach them to observe all things    **\nMatthew 28 verse 18 to 20     **\n18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. \n19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost  \n20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.    **\nThe Christian woman is a disciple of Christ just as the Christian man. This commission is also directed to her and is as follows \ni.\tGo ye therefore and teach all nations.\nii.\tBaptize them in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. \niii.\tTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. \niv.\tI am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.  **\nThis scripture authorizes the Christian woman to preach the gospel in order to raise disciples for Christ wherever she is. She is always authorized to teach the converts and the ignorant disciples all the word of God. The Lord has promised to be with her if she faithfully engages in this commission. But the Christian woman minister should learn how to work among men with all subjection, holiness and understanding. The authority of man must not be usurped at any time.    **\n6.4 Study, Mediate And Obey God's Word   **\n Matthew 4 verse 4 But He answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.  **\nPsalm 119 verse 9 to 11     **\n 9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to Thy word. \n10 With my whole heart have I sought thee; O let me not wander from Thy commandments. \n11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against Thee.   **\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 15      **\n15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.   **\nTo maintain the Christian life and be successful in ministry the Christian minister needs to feed on the word of God daily as she feeds on food to maintain her physical body. The minister must never cease reading the scriptures and inspired writings by anointed Christian writers. She takes in sufficient spiritual nourishment that will sustain her Christian life and enrich her with the Christian message. She should not be denominationally bounded but be open to God to use His anointed servant from wherever He chooses to bless her life.   **\nFirst Timothy 4 verse 13 to 15,     **\n13 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. \n14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. \n15 Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.   **\n6.5 Sound Prayer Life   **\nJeremiah 29 verse 10 to 12     **\n10 For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform My good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place. \n11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. \n12 Then shall ye call upon Me, and ye shall go and pray unto Me, and I will hearken unto you.   **\nMatthew 7 verse 7 to 8,     **\n7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you  **\nMatthew 7 verse 8      **\nFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened  **\nEphesians 6 verse 8      **\nKnowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free  **\nThe woman minister must give herself to prayer. Although she may be surrounded with marital and domestic demand, she has to create time for her God. Prayer is required to keep her in continual holiness before God. It is a vital means for her spiritual strength and mentoring in the Christian life and ministry. Apart from creating time for this, she needs to get a prayer partner to help her prayer labour. Night vigils, prayer and fasting and other prayer methods must be devised and be well participated by her. The God who answers prayers will always be there to prove His faithfulness and for her success and encouragement.   **\n 6.6 Good Fasting life   **\nMatthew 17 verse 21     **\nHowbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting   **\n Learn to fast. Fast often, but do not abuse your faith life by monotonous and uninspired fasting. Fasting strengthens your faith and prayer and gives you victory over some strong holds of the enemy. Be sensitive to God's guidance to fasting.    **\n6.7 Preach and Teach Sound Doctrine   **\nTitus 1 verse 1 to 2     **\n1 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; \n2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;   **\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 2      **\n2 And the things that thou hast heard of Me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.   **\nPreach the truth as you have learned in righteous and holy ministers. It is the truth that produces repentance from sin and holy living among believers. The truth gives the hearer freedom from sin, Satan and the world. Preach God's truth and love, truth and wisdom, truth and service. Emphasize truth, righteousness and holiness to your audience. Human blessings are found in obedience to God's scriptural truths. Remember that it is as you practice and preach those doctrines of truth that you and those you minister to can inherit eternal life.   **\nFirst Timothy 4 verse 16     **\nTake heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them, for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.  **\n6.8 Have Faith in God for Your Ministry   **\nMark 11 verse 22     **\nAnd Jesering saith unto them, Have faith in God   **\nGenesis 15 verse 1     **\nAfter these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram, I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.    **\nRomans 1 verse 17     **\nFor therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, The just shall live by faith.    **\nLearn to live by faith in God. Trust absolutely in God in God. Depend on Him for your provision, protection, power for service, and progress. Believe the promises God has made to you. Through faith in God you can confront oppositions on your way. Through faith you shall finish well and die in righteousness and holiness or be a partaker in the rapture of the saint.    **\nHebrew 11 verse 1 to 3,6    **\n1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\n2 For by it the elders obtained a good report.\n3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. \n6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for He that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.   **\n 6.9 Support in Ministry   **\nAct 20 verse 33 to 35     **\nI have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel. \n34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me. \n35 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive  **\nFirst Corinthians 9 verse 14 to 15     **\n14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. \n15 But I have used none of these things, neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me, for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void    **\n\nSome ministries are small enough to be run by the women ministers without much need of human material and financial support. But some require these because of the size of the ministry. God will provide the support. He who gave the ministry will supply all that are necessary to run it successfully and righteously. He will stir financial and material support from the right source. However, we learn from Apostle Paul that the minster should be personally involved in providing and supporting her ministry where she can. Paul was into paid labour, engaging himself in his craft here and there to provide for himself and those working with him. He said he did this so that people will not blaspheme his gospel service on account of his financial demands. The women minister should never preach for money nor cajole the people of God into unwilling and ungodly giving. False prophecies, promises and miracles must be hated and resisted to the end, or her life never should she be in a rush to grow the ministry. She must work in peace, giving thanks for the little she is achieving for the Lord. She must avoid association with ungodly and deceitful workers. She must watch and pray over those who want to join or support the ministry to ensure God sent them.   **\n 6.10 Expect Your Rewards from God   **\nRevelation 22 verse 12     **\n12 And, behold, I come quickly; and My reward is with Me, to give every man according as his work shall be.   **\nFirst  Corinthians 15 verse 58     **\n58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.\n Second Timothy 4 verse 6 to 8    **\n6 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.\n7 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith  \n8 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.     **\nAll that labour for the Lord in true and righteous ministry both man and woman shall be rewarded according to their works. Labour for the rewards that come from God. Make sure you keep yourself in truth, righteousness and holiness so that you may enter heaven and enjoy great rewards that awaits you. Know that God rewards His faithful servants on earth also. Holiness and righteousness is the key to an acceptable and fruitful women ministry.     **\nIsaiah 6 verse 1 to 8    **\n1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple. \n2 Above it stood the seraphims; each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly. \n3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts  the whole earth is full of His glory. \n4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. \n5 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips,  for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts. \n6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;\n7 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.\n8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for Us? Then said I, Here am I; send me    **\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7  **\nPREACH WHAT JESUS AND THE APOSTLES PREACHED   **\nEveryone desiring to enter heaven must preach what Jesus Christ and His apostles preached. You will also have the same result they had and will receive His commendation as a good and faithful minister. The following are key messages of the Bible to be preached and taught besides the whole Bible. Preachers must preach the balanced gospel and labour in the word and doctrine to present every man perfect in Christ Jesus to God the Father for His eternal possession.   **\nSecond  Timothy 3 verse 15 to 17     **\n15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. \n16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness. \n17 That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works    **\nAs you study the Bible carefully note the following cardinal message preached by Christ and the apostle inspired by the spirit of Christ presented here. Believe and practice all the word of God that you may have entrance into heaven and the everlasting kingdom of God.   **\nSecond Peter 1 verse 8 to 11     **\n8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see far off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. \n10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things, ye shall never fail; \n11 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ.   **\nPlease preach the full Bible message to others also for their salvation, holiness and eternal life. Many are ignorant of these truths    **\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 2   **\nAnd the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.   **\nMatthew 28 verse 18 to 20    **\n18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth. \n19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. \n20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you  and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen  **\nFirst Timothy 4 verse 6    **\nIf thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained   **\nSecond Timothy 4 verse 11 to 16    **\n11 These things command and teach. \n12 Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in purity. \n13 Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. \n14 Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. \n15 Meditate upon these things; give thyself 16 Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them,  for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.   **\n\n\nTHE TRINITY AND SUPREMACY OF THE GODHEAD   **\nThe Holy Scripture    **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  The Holy Scripture is the word of God written by the inspiration of God, having final authority in all matters that concern men on earth and in the doctrines, activities and administration of the church of Christ in the world. The scripture is pure, perfect, powerful, and eternal. Its commandments are binding on all men. Its prophecies never fail. Its promises are dependable. Its central message is Jesus Christ and its offer is eternal with God. Its life is righteousness and holiness in Christ. Its ultimate promise is heaven. Its writers were perfectly inspired by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Scripture, the Bible, is made up of 66 books, beginning with the book of Genesis and ending with the book of Revelation. The Scripture is called the word of God, or the word of Christ. Nothing must be added to it and nothing must be subtracted from it. All prophecies and revelations in the church must be authenticated by the scripture.    **\n Matthew 5 verse 17 to 20     **\n17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets, I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.\n 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\n 19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven, but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. \n20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.    **\nSecond Timothy 3 verse 15 to 17     **\n15 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. \n16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;\n17 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.   **\nTrinity of the Godhead   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  God is one Person in three separate individuals called the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, and three separate individuals in one Person called God, Lord, Jehovah, Creator. The Father, the Son Jesus and the Holy Spirit exist from eternity to eternity. The Son came to the world to save men from sin, Satan and eternal death and give them eternal life, the life of God. On earth He bore the name Jesus Christ.   **\nMatthew 28 verse 19    **\nGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost   **\n Mark 12 verse 29   **\nAnd Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord.    **\n First John 5 verse 7    **\n For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one  **\nChrist's Complete Victory Over Satan  **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Jesus Christ is Lord and creator of Satan and his demon host. Jesus destroyed Satan and his kingdom on the cross. He did this to give men total freedom from the power and influence of Satan. In Christ those oppressed by the devil receive complete deliverance.   **\n Jesus is Lord in heaven, on earth and under the earth. At the mention of His name Satan and his kingdom bow in total surrender! Christ's triumphant victory over Satan and his kingdom has been given to all who believe on Him. Believers can exercise this authority through faith in the word of God and the use of the name of Jesus.   **\n Luke 10 verse 17 to 20    **\n17 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. \n18 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. \n19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy  and nothing shall by any means hurt you. \n20 Not withstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven   **\nColossians 2 verse 14, 15   **\n14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; \n15 And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it   **\nThe Judgment Of God On Sinners   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  God is the great and righteous Judge. Sinners and backsliders suffer His Judgment one way or the other in this world for their evil and wicked works and in the life to come He will sentence them to everlasting condemnation.    **\nLuke 12 verse 5   **\nBut I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear  Fear Him, which after He hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear Him.    **\nHebrews 10 verse 30, 31    **\n30 For we know Him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto Me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge His people. \n31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God  **\nThe rewards of God for the righteous Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  God rewards the good deeds done by His righteous Children. It will be unrighteousness on the part of God not to reward the works of righteousness done by His righteous children. Hence believers should not be weary in well doing, for they shall be rewarded. God rewards the righteous both in this life and in the life to come.   **\nMark 10 verse 28 to 30    **\n28 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. \n29 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, \n30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life   **\nHebrews 6 verse 9 to 18   **\n9 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak. \n10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward His name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister. \n11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end; \n12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises. \n13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because He could swear by no greater, He sware by Himself, \n14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee. \n15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.\n16 For men verily swear by the greater; and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife. \n17 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath; \n18 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us   **\nSalvation In Jesus Christ Alone   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Only in Jesus can men find the way, the truth and eternal life. He is the only way to God in heaven. Human beings on earth can be saved from sin and eternal damnation in hell fire only through Jesus. There is no religion, prophet, wise man or name in the whole universe that can bring salvation from sin and eternal death. Jesus is the universal Savior and Lord.   **\nJohn 8 verse 24   **\nI said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins,  for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins   **\nActs 4 verse 10 to 12    **\n10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.\n11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. \n12 Neither is there salvation in any other,  for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. The Suffering, Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ  **\n\nCHAPTER 8  **\nRIGHTEOUSNESS AND HOLINESS IN CHRIST  **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  As man on earth living among men, Jesus suffered in the hands of wicked men. His claim as the Lord and Saviour of the world and the Son of God was rejected. He was crucified on the cross. He died, was buried, but resurrected the third day and went back to heaven. He satisfied what God required for men's salvation from sin and eternal damnation and for their possession of eternal life. Now men in the world can be saved and reconciled to God through Jesus Christ.   **\nMatthew 16 verse   21   **\nFrom that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the third day   **\nFirst Corinthians 15 verse 1 to 4    **\n1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;\n2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. \n3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; \n4 And that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the scriptures   **\nRepentance From Sin   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  A sinner who desires salvation from his sins and a new life of righteousness found in Christ must hate his sins and turn away from them. The works of the flesh must be rejected  fornication, idolatry, witchcraft, drunkenness, corruption, malice, stealing, lying, anger, backbiting, etc. Complete turning away from sin is required in order to receive the free offer of salvation that is in Jesus Christ.   **\nLuke 13 verse 3 I tell you, Nay; but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.  **\n Acts 8 verse 22, 23    **\n22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.\n23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.   **\nFaith In Christ For Salvation Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  A sinner who has repented from his sins needs to exercise faith on the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in order to receive salvation from sin and the power to live a righteous life. This requires inviting Jesus into his life to be his Lord and Saviour. Salvation from sin is also known as forgiveness of sin, born again, the new birth, regeneration, justification, and reconciliation.   **\nJohn 3 verse 14 to 18    **\n14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up; \n15 That whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have eternal life. \n16 For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. \n17 For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through Him might be saved. \n18 He that believeth on Him is not condemned  but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.   **\nJohn 1 verse 9 to 13     **\n9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.\n10 He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew him not. \n11 He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. \n12 But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name; \n13 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.   **\nRestitution  Correcting Past Wrong Doings   **\nGenesis 20 verse 1 to 18; Leviticus 6 verse 1 to 7; Ezekiel 33 verse 14 to 16; Luke 19 verse 1 to 10. \nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  A person who has given his life to Jesus needs to make amendment or rectify the errors of his life where the scriptures specify so. Such include making peace with offended persons, making apology, returning stolen property, confessing hidden crimes to appropriate persons, making correction in marriage (in case of unscriptural marriage such as marrying two wives, marrying somebody else's wife or husband, divorcing one's first wife or husband), relinquishing false claims, certificates or results. This is required in order to have peace of righteousness and a conscience void of offence towards God and man.   **\nMatthew 5 verse 23 to 26     **\n23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; \n24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. \n25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. \n26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing. \nActs 24 verse 16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men   **\nPhilemon 1 verse 17 to 19    **\n17 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. \n18 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;\n19 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it, albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides  **\nSanctification Of Heart Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  One who has believed in Christ still requires an experience of grace called sanctification. Jesus prayed that His disciples might be sanctified. Sanctification is an experience which a believer receives from God by faith. The believer who is sanctified receives inner cleansing from the remains of sin in his heart and is purged from inward struggles and defilement of pride, anger, malice, lust, greed, bitterness etc. which often overcomes the believer. Sanctification does in a believer what rinsing does in a cloth that has been washed with detergent. After salvation experience, the believer needs the experience of sanctification for heart purity and holiness. A believer needs consecration, prayer and faith to receive this experience from God. Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God. Sanctification experience makes the believer's heart clean and pure. Sanctification also means consecration or dedication to God's use. Christ dedicated Himself for salvation and holiness of man.   **\nJohn 17 verse 16 to 20     **\n16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. \n17 Sanctify them through thy truth;  thy word is truth. 18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.\n19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. \n20 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;   **\nEphesians 5 verse 25 to 27     **\n25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; \n26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, \n27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish  **\nThe Fruit Of The Spirit   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Those who believe in Christ have the Spirit of Christ indwelling them. This Spirit sheds in them spiritual virtues of love, joy, peace, faith, goodness, meekness, gentleness, patience, self-control. Every believer should avail himself for the development of the fruit of the Spirit to make his light shine before men in righteousness and holiness so that they may glorify God on his behalf.   **\nMatthew 5 verse 14 to 16      **\n14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.\n15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. \n16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven   **\nGalatians 5 verse 22 to 25     **\n22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, \n23 Meekness, temperance  against such there is no law. \n24 And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.\n25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit   **\nBelievers Are Not Of The World   **\nGenesis 35 verse 1 to 5; Exodus 33 verse 4 to 6; Proverbs 7 verse 10; Isaiah 3 verse 16 to 24; first Timothy 2 verse 18 to 10; first Peter 3 verse 3 to 4; Numbers 31 verse 50. Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Those who have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ to be their Lord and Saviour have become children of God. They are not of the world and so must not love the world nor the things of the world. They must not speak, walk, dress or act like the sinners in the world. They must steer clear from worldly dressing, clothing, make-up and styles. They must not use jewelry which include earrings, nose rings, necklace, chains, bracelets, rings, wedding rings, and beads. They must not perm or jerry curl their hair. They must not use hair attachment, weave-on, cortex, lipsticks. They must not use body revealing dresses. The women must not use trousers, miniskirts and any kind of indecent dresses. The men too must not cut their hair in worldly styles nor dress ungodly. Their hearts must not be set on the riches or fanciful things of this world. Believers must abstain from worldly music and dancing and must not bring that into the church for the worship of God   **\nMatthew 6 verse 19 to 24     **\n19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal; \n20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal; \n21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 22 The light of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. \n23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!\n 24 No man can serve two masters  for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\nJohn 17 verse 14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.  **\nFirst John 2 verse 15 to 17     **\n15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. \n16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. \n17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof  but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever    **\nRevelation 17 verse 1 to 5     **\n1 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters   **\nBelievers Victory Over Temptation, Persecution And Suffering   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  All men in the world, believers or unbelievers, suffer temptation. The tempter is the devil. His aim is to cause the one tempted to fall into sin and suffer death penalty from God. Temptation can come in various ways and from various sources. Believers are advised to be sober and vigilant, to watch and pray that they may not fall into temptation. Where required the believer may have to flee from the object of temptation, to cut off his right hand, pluck out his right eye, etc, in order not to fall into sin and damn his soul in eternal hell. God's grace is sufficient for anyone who looks to Him for help in times of temptation. Again, it is normal for Christ's followers to suffer persecution and to face various kinds of challenges in life for righteousness and Christian service. These should be faced with faith, prayers and thanksgiving to God who is our Comforter, Sustainer, Provider, Wisdom, and Victory. Believers must take the challenges of life patiently.   **\nMatthew 26 verse 41      **\nWatch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation, the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak   **\nMatthew 5 verse 9 to 12     **\n9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. \n10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake,  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. \n11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.\n12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad,  for great is your reward in heaven  for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you   **\n James 1 verse 13 to 15     **\n13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man  \n14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. \n15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death   **\nHebrews 2 verse 18     **\nFor in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted   **\nFirst Corinthians 10 verse 13     **\nThere hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man  but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it  **\nSupremacy of Love   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  The greatest commandment or the summary of all the commandments of God is love. Man is to love God supremely and to love his neighbour as himself. True Christian love for God and fellow men keeps the believer free from sin and evil. To love God means to keep His commandments. Believers are to have sincere love for one another and for fellow men.  **\nMark 12 verse 29 to 33       **\n29 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord  \n30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength, this is the first commandment. \n31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these. \n32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth, for there is one God; and there is none other but he; 33 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices   **\nRomans 13 verse 8 to 10       **\n8 Owe no man anything, but to love one another, for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.\n9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. \n10 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. Necessity of Prayer   **\n\nCHAPTER 9   **\nBELIEVERS' POWER AND AUTHORITY IN CHRIST  **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Prayer is an important duty for every believer. Prayer is talking with God. It gives the believer the privilege to express himself satisfactorily in a child-to- Father Relationship with God. Through prayer a believer can receive the desires of his heart from God. Prayer gives the believer the privilege to affect the lives of others in the world through the power of God. Prayer gives the believer power over Satan and his wicked system. We are to pray in the name of Jesus. We must pray according to God's word and promises, according to God's will. Men ought always to pray and not to faint. Men must repent from all sins and come to righteousness for their prayer to be answered by God.   **\nMatthew 6 verse 9 to 15      **\n9 After this manner therefore pray ye, Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. \n10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.\n11 Give us this day our daily bread. 12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. \n13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil; For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. \n14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you  \n15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses   **\n James 5 verse 13 to 16      **\n13 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms. 14 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; \n15 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him. \n16 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much. \n17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months. 18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit   **\nNecessity of Faith   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Faith is indispensable for living. To live one must have faith in God, faith on the Lord Jesus Christ, faith on His word and promises and faith in the name of Jesus. God can only be pleased by those that come to Him by faith. All things are possible to him that believes in God and His word.   **\nMark 11 verse 22 to 24     **\n22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. \n23 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. \n24 Therefore I say unto you, What things so ever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them   **\nRomans 1 verse 16, 17      **\n16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ  for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.\n17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith   **\nFasting   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Fasting is a spiritual discipline in which a believer abstains from food, solid and liquid. It may also involve abstaining from water. Fasting is a spiritual discipline required of every believer. Fasting strengthens the spiritual life of believers. There are some circumstances or forces of evil that only submit when prayer is backed up by fasting.  **\nMatthew 17 verse 19 to 21     **\n19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out? \n20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief  for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. \n21 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting   **\nActs 13 verse 1 to 3     **\n1 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul \n2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. \n3 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away   **\nHealing, Deliverance, Miracles And Prosperity In Christ   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Men can find healing, deliverance and miracles through faith in Christ. Christ did not only suffer and die to provide salvation from sin, but also to restore the sick to health, deliver the oppressed from the devil and provide the needs of men on the earth. His blessings and prosperity are freely available to all who come to Him in faith. Through faith in Christ Jesus we can be healed of all manner of sickness and all manner of disease. Through faith in Christ we can prosper in the work of our hands.   **\nLuke 4 verse 18, 19      **\n18 The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He hath sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, 19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.   **\nThird  John 1 verse 2     **\nBeloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth   **\n\nEVANGELISM AND CHRISTIAN SERVICE   **\nBaptism With The Holy Spirit   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  One who is born again is promised the baptism with the Holy Spirit. This is called the promise of the Father. Baptism with the Holy Spirit is the infilling of a believer with the power of Holy Spirit. This is required for effective and fruitful Christian service. The evidence of baptism with the Holy Spirit is speaking in tongues by the enabling of the Holy Spirit. Every believer has the Holy Spirit called the Spirit of Christ in him. But not every believer is baptized or filled with the Holy Spirit. To receive the Holy Spirit baptism a believer needs to believe that it is God's will for him. In hunger and thirst for the baptism with the Holy Spirit, he needs to seek the face of the Lord in importunate prayer and faith for this experience.  **\nActs 1 verse 5, 8     **\n5 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. \n8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you  and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.   **\nActs 2 verse 4, 38, 39     **\n4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. \n38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. \n39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call   **\nThe Great Commission   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  All disciples of Christ are commissioned by the Lord to go into the world and preach the gospel to every human creature. The commission given entails going out to tell the sinners everywhere the good news of salvation in Christ, baptizing those who accept or believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and teaching the believers all the word of God. This involves personal evangelism, crusade evangelism, literature evangelism, media evangelism and every legitimate way of passing the gospel of Jesus to the perishing world. The great commission has two components. Firstly, to bring sinners to faith in Christ for their salvation from sin. Secondly, to teach the believers or disciples all the word of God written in the Bible. This is required for their freedom, righteousness, holiness, victory, fruitfulness, and eternal life. It is not enough for a man to be born again, he needs to know and practice scriptural truths and doctrines required for the security of his Christian faith. Without full obedience to every word of God and holiness, no man shall see the Lord. It is not good to be in ignorance. Ignorance of the requirements of eternal life will hinder one from possessing it. All true believers and churches are working for one cause and so should learn to work together where required to win the world for Jesus. The great commission calls for wisdom and dedication in Christ's disciples.  **\nMark 16 verse 15 to 18     **\n15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. \n17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; 18 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover   **\nMatthew 28 verse 18 to 20     **\n18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. \n19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; \n20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.   **\nSecond Timothy 4 verse 1 to 5     **\n1 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; \n2 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. \n3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; \n4 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. \n5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry   **\n First Corinthians 12 verse 27, 28     **\n27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. \n28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues   **\n Ministerial Calling   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  All believers are given one or more gift to minister in the service of God. It is God that distributes these gifts to His Children according to His will. Every believer should trade with his gift of grace.\nHowever, there is special calling into special function and office which God gives to whom He wills. No man takes this honour to himself. The things of God are not carnal but spiritual. It is God that calls to the office of an apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. It is God that knows and calls people to be General overseer over Churches and ministries. To assume an office which God did not give you is to hurt the course of Christ and the lives of men. Hence ministerial office is not only attained to by desire, but by biblical qualifications and divine call. God equips His ministers with spiritual gifts for effective ministry among men.   **\nMatthew 4 verse 18 to 22     **\n18 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers. \n19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. 20 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him. \n21 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them. \n22 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him  **\nJohn 15 verse 1, 2     **\n1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. 2 Every , branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit    **\nEphesians 4 verse 7 to 14     **\n7 But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. \n11 And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; \n12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ; \n13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; \n14 That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;    **\nFirst Timothy 3 verse 1 to 13     **\n1 This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. \n2 Abishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; \n3 Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous; \n4 One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; \n5 (For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) \n6 Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil. \n7 Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. \n8 Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; \n9 Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.\n10 And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless. 11 Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.\n 12 Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well. \n13 For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus   **\nChrist's Authority Vested on the Local Church  **\nFirst Corinthians 5 verse 1 to 13; 6 verse 1 to 7; first Timothy 3 verse 15 Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  The local church of Christ is vested with divine authority to act representatively of Him in issues of administration among believers and church discipline. The local church is vested with the authority to teach the word of truth in the name of the Lord and to watch over the lives of church members. The roles of the church include judging between believers and administering discipline to the erring ones. Hence the leadership of the church must be respected and reverenced as those that must give account to God for all the souls in the local church. The pastors, Elders or Bishops of the church should be honored for their work sake. Honour also should be given to the deacons and all who are vested with righteous authority in the church of God, which is the house of God.   **\nMatthew 16 verse 18     **\nAnd I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it  **\n Matthew 18 verse 15 to 20     **\n15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone, if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. 16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established. \n17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church, but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. \n18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven  and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. \n19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. \n20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them   **\nActs 20 verse 17 to 32    **\n17And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church. \n18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, 19 Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews  \n20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house, \n21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. \n22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there; \n23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. \n24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.\n25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more. \n26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. 27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. \n28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which He hath purchased with His own blood. \n29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. \n30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them. \n31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. 32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified  **\nFirst Timothy 3 verse 15     **\nBut if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth   **\nBelievers' Authority in Christ Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Those who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ have been empowered by Jesus to do what He can do  to heal the sick, cast out devils, perform miracles. They have been given authority to use the name of Jesus in prayer and praise and for ministry and miracles   **\nJohn 14 verse 12 to 14   **\n12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. 13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. \n14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it  **\nActs 3 verse 1 to 16    **\n1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.\n2 And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; \n3 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms. \n4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us. \n5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them. \n6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee; In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. \n7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up; and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength. \n8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God. \n9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God; \n10 And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.\n11 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering. \n12 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk? \n13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified His Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied Him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let Him go. \n14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you; \n15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses. \n16 And His name through faith in His name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know; yea, the faith which is by Him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all   **\nBrotherly Love And Unity   **\n Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Brotherly love and Christian unity adorn the gospel of Christ and glorify God. The world by these qualities recognizes the children of God and are attracted to the gospel of Christ. Brotherly love must be in sincerity and purity, without hypocrisy. Believers are one in Christ, whatever their tribe, nation, race, sex, rank, and denomination. Christian love and unity must be practiced with all sincerity and purity. Believers should be hospitable and generous. Christian love and unity must centre on the lordship of Jesus, the authority of scripture, biblical righteousness and holiness, evangelism and Christian service.   **\nJohn 13 verse 34, 35     **\n34 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. 35 By this shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one to another     **\nJohn 17 verse 20 to 23     **\n20 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through their word; \n21 That they all may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us  that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me. \n22 And the glory which Thou gavest Me I have given them; that they may be one, even as We are one; \n23 I in them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved Me   ** \nFirst John 4 verse 7 to 12    **\n7 Beloved, let us love one another  for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. \n8 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. \n9 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him. \n10 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. \n11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. \n12 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and His love is perfected in us    **\nPhilippians 2 verse 1 to 5    **\n1 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, \n2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.\n3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. \n4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. 5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus   **\nGalatians 1 verse 6 to 10   **\n6 I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel  \n7 Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. \n8 But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. \n9 As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. \n10 For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ   **\n\n\nCHAPTER 10  **\nOBEDIENCE TO GOD’S COMMANDMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS   **\nWater baptism Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Everyone who has heard the gospel of Jesus Christ, has repented from his sins and has accepted Jesus to be his Lord and Saviour with all his heart will require water baptism as a confirmation of his claim. Water baptism is one immersion into a body of water in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Water baptism is not for ignorant children or people who have not yet repented from their sins.   **\nMark 16 verse 15, 16    **\n15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. \n16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned   **\nMatthew 28 verse 19    **\nGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost   **\nActs 8 verse 36 to 38    **\n36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water  and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? \n37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. \n38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still, and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him   **\nChristian Devotion   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Studying God's word, hearing God's word, meditating on God's word and praying without ceasing play great role in making a believer know the Lord and His ways, obey the Lord and His word, grow in grace and acquire spiritual strength. The word of God in a believer's life and regular fervent and prevalent prayer build faith, make the believer victorious over sin, the flesh, the world, and Satan. Hence the believer must study the word of God, meditate on the word of God and hear the preaching of the word of God always. Good and inspired Christian materials as books, recorded messages etc. are of great advantage in this respect. Regular personal quiet time with God and family devotion are important observances for a Christian and the Christian home.  **\nMatthew 4 verse 4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.   **\nLuke 10 verse 38 to 42   **\n38 Now it came to pass, as they went, that He entered into a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha received Him into her house. \n39 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. \n40 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to Him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. \n41 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things; \n42 But one thing is needful  and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her   **\nEphesians 6 verse 10 to 18  **\n10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. \n11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.\n12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. \n13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. \n14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness; \n15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. \n17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; \n18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints    **\nRegular Observance of the Lord's Super    **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  The Lord's Supper or Holy Communion is to be observed by the body of believers regularly to remind each other of His death for human salvation until He comes. The Holy Communion must be partaken by righteous and holy believer. Everyone must examine himself to ensure he is in the faith, before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. Taking the Holy Communion in sin attracts God's judgment. There must be respect for the body of Jesus and the blood of Jesus represented by the Communion bread and wine.   **\nLuke 22 verse 19 to 20  **\n19 And He took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is My body which is given for you, this do in remembrance of Me. \n20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you   **\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 23 to 34   **\n23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which He was betrayed took bread  \n24 And when He had given thanks, He brake it, and said, Take, eat this is My body, which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of Me. \n25 After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in My blood  this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of Me.\n26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till He come. \n27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. \n28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. \n29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. \n30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. \n31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. \n32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world   **\nChristian Giving   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Children of God should give of their money and material resources so as to advance the course of Christ among men. All believers are expected to pay tithes, which is ten percent of their earnings. Tithes should be paid over salary and wages, food crop, and domestic animals. Apart from tithes believers are to give material offering willingly to the Lord. The poor and needy should be assisted. Believers are to give generously to support the gospel of Christ and His faithful ministers. Ministers of the gospel must not force money out of people for the cause of Christ. God loves a cheerful giver. They must not also play tricks on the people to drain them of their material resources. That will be iniquity before the Lord.   **\nMatthew 23 verse 23   **\nWoe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith  these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.   **\nSecond Corinthians 9 verse 6 to 9    **\n 6 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. \n7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity,  for God loveth a cheerful giver.\n8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work  \n9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor  his righteousness remaineth forever    **\nImportance Of Forgiveness    **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Believers who have enjoyed the forgiveness of God and do enjoy it daily should also administer forgiveness to those that offend them, whatever the offense. Not to forgive those that offend them means forfeiting the forgivingness they have received from God. Christian husbands and wives should forgive their spouse of any sin including adultery. Hence no sin in marriage can cause divorce.  **\n Matthew 18 verse 21 to 35    **\n21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? \n22 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but, Until seventy times seven.\n23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants. \n24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents. \n25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. \n26 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. \n27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt. \n28 But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, which owed him an hundred pence, and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest. \n29 And his fellow servant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.\n30 And he would not  but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt. \n31 So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. \n32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me  \n33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow servant, even as I had pity on thee? \n34 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him. \n35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses  **\nEphesians 4 verse 31, 32   **\n31 Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice; \n32 And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you   **\nChristian Marriage And Family   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Marriage is for one man and one woman. Polygamy is forbidden by God. When a man who has never married before gets married to a woman who has never married before according to the terms of marriage, the union is binding for life till the death of one of the partners. Divorce and remarriage when the marriage partner is still alive in the world is evil and brings the damnation of hell. When marriage is formed it can never be dissolved by adultery. They phrase “Except for fornication'' in Matthew 5 32 only concerns those who are still in engagement according to Jewish tradition. The practical example of this was what Joseph thought to do to Mary when he thought she had committed fornication. The phrase also concerns one whose marriage partner had been lawfully married o one who is still alive. Believers who want to marry must not marry unbelievers, but fellow believers. Marriage between man and man or woman and woman is an abomination to God. Husband and wives must live in love and raise up godly children.   **\nMark 10 verse 6 to 12    **\n6 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female. \n7 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and cleave to his wife;\n8 And they twain shall be one flesh, so then they are no more twain, but one flesh. \n9 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. 10 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter. \n11 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. \n12 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery.   **\nRomans 7 verse 2, 3   **\n2 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. \n3 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress  but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.   **\nChristian Fellowship and Worship Service    **\nFirst Corinthians 11 verse 1 to 15; Hebrews 10 verse 25 Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Believers must value the fellowship of themselves together for the purpose of worship and for their edification, exhortation and comfort. Fellowship of believers helps the believer to grow in the faith and to be consistent in the Christian walk. However the believer must avoid the fellowship of ignorant and sinful worshippers where spiritual blindness prevails. The believer is particularly instructed to follow righteousness, faith, purity, and love with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. Christ is the head of the man and the man is the head of the woman. During worship, praying or prophesying the man must leave his head open without any manner of covering on it. This is because Christ's headship over man must visibly be seen during such occasions. To lay any manner of covering on his head is to dishonor Christ. The word Bishop in Bible sense means pastor or elder in the church first Timothy  3 verse 1.   **\nHence the tradition that a Bishop may preach or pray with a cap on his head and wear jewelry is a contradiction to the word of God and has eternal implications! Similarly, a woman should cover her head during program worship, when praying or prophesying. This is to show in a physical sense that man is not in headship during these activities. Those who rebel against this scriptural instruction shall answer for themselves before God. The Church is the pillar and ground of the truth. Hence scriptural decency, truth and orderliness must be observed in the local church without respect of persons.   **\nMatthew 18 verse 19, 20   **\n19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven. \n20 For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them.   **\nFirst John 1 verse 3 to 7   **\n3 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ. \n4 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full. \n5 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. \n6 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth; \n7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.  **\nPraises and Thanksgiving   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Worship, praises and thanksgiving is our duty toward God our creator. We must always remember to give God thanks for all His mercies, kindness, love, and goodness shown to us and others daily. The forgiveness of sins we receive from Him through Jesus Christ calls for praise, worship and thanksgiving to the living God. Not only must we manifest the spirit of gratitude to God, God desires that we manifest that to one another. It is disheartening to God that human beings who drink His goodness every day do not bother to give thanks and praise to God. Even our fellow men feel disappointed when they are not appreciated for their good deeds. We must testify of the goodness of God and sing His praise with the whole of our heart.  **\nLuke 17 verse 11 to 19   **\n11 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. \n12 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off; \n13 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.\n14 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. \n15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, \n16 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks, and he was a Samaritan. \n17 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? 18 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. \n19 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way, thy faith hath made thee whole.  **\nEphesians 5 verse 19, 20   **\n19 Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; \n20 Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;   **\n\nCHAPTER 11   **\nLAST DAYS EVENTS   **\nCharacteristics Of The Last Days   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  The last days shall be characterized by multiplicity of iniquity, hatred of God, natural disasters, intensified satanic activities, backsliding, false prophets and teachers performing miracles, human carelessness and mockery for the coming of the Lord. Yet the last days also shall be characterized with outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon men and women for explosive gospel work and the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ shall be preached in all the world using various means and scientific technology. Preachers of truth and holiness shall still be there doing their job until the end. Despite hardship, fierce persecution and great challenges, people shall still believe the gospel and persevere in righteousness till the end.   **\nMatthew 24 verse 1, 4 to 14   **\n1 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? \n4 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. \n5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. \n6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars; see that ye be not troubled  for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. \n7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. \n8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. \n9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you; and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake. \n10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one \n11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive\n12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. \n13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. \n14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.   **\nSecond Peter 3 verse 1 to 14   **\n1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance  \n2 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour  \n3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts, \n4 And saying, Where is the promise of His coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation. \n5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water  \n6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished \n7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men. \n8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. \n9 The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. \n10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. \n11 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, \n12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? \n13 Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.\n14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him in peace, without spot, and blameless.    **\nFalse Prophets And Teachers   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Believers should beware of false prophets and false teachers. These appear outwardly religious and spiritual. They show much spirituality with their mouth, but their heart is wicked and abominable. They can be known by their fruits. Their fruits include their sinful life, false doctrine, erroneous interpretation of scriptures, sin laden converts, demonic signs and wonders and outright rebellion against God. Believers must beware of them, must verify, test and proof every preacher by the word of God to see whether he is of God or not. The doctrines taught and miracles performed by them must be authenticated by the scripture. This scriptural verification is required on every preacher, General overseer, Church founder and even the Sunday school teacher. The souls of men are precious and should not be left in the hands of corrupt men to destroy!    **\nMatthew 7 verse 15 to 23    **\n15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. \n16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?\n17 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. \n18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. \n19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. \n20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them. \n21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. \n22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? \n23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.    **\nSecond Peter 2 verse 1 to 3   **\n1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. 2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.\n3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you  whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.   **\nThe Rapture of the saints Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  The Lord will return to rapture His saints from the earth to heaven. He shall descend from heaven with His angels and the saints now in heaven with a shout, with the voice of the arch angel. The trumpet of God shall sound. The Lord shall remain in the air. The saints who came with Him from heaven shall return to the earth to be reunited with their body and shall resurrect with a glorious body. The saints alive on earth shall suddenly be changed and transformed, with glorious eternal body. They shall rise to meet the Lord in the air. The Lord shall take them all back to heaven for the marriage supper and to give them eternal rewards according to their works. This is a message of comfort to believers. The rapture is the first phase of the second coming of Jesus Christ.   **\nMatthew 24 verse 36 to 42    **\n36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only. \n37 But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\n38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, \n39 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.\n40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. \n41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left. \n42 Watch therefore  for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.   **\nFirst Thessalonians 4 verse 13 to 18   **\n13 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. \n14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. \n15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.\n16 For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God  and the dead in Christ shall rise first  \n17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord. \n18 Wherefore comfort one another with these words.   **\nThe Great Tribulation and the Antichrist    **\nRevelation 13 verse 1 to 18; 16 verse 1 to 18; Zechariah 14 verse 1 to 7 Revelation 19 verse 11 to 21. Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  After the rapture of the saints to heaven there shall be great tribulation on the earth for seven years. This shall be the period of unequalled suffering, hardship and persecution on the earth. God shall visit the earth with series of divine judgment. This period also shall usher in the Antichrist who shall be a physical representative of Satan. He shall persecute the saints who shall become converted after the rapture and shall persecute the nation Israel. He shall declare himself God and demand worship from human beings. He shall cause men on earth to take his mark 666. Whoever shall collect it is damned forever. His reign and power shall be terminated when Jesus shall return physically to the earth at His second coming at the end of seven years after the rapture of the saints to heaven. The Lord shall defeat the Antichrist and His army at the battle of Armageddon. He and the false prophet that promotes him shall be cast alive into the lake of fire.   **\nMatthew 24 verse 15 to 22   **\n15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand;) \n16 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains  \n17 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house;\n18 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes. \n19 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! 20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day  \n21 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. \n22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved  but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened   **\nSecond Thessalonians 2 verse 3 to 10    **\n 3 Let no man deceive you by any means  for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; \n4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. \n5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? \n6 And now ye know what with holdeth that he might be revealed in his time. \n7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work  only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. \n8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming; \n9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,\n10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.    **\nThe Second Coming Of Christ For The Millennial Reign John 18 verse 33 to 37; Acts 1 verse 9 to 11; Isaiah 2 verse 1 to 5; 35 verse 1 to 10; Revelation 20 verse 1 to 10. Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  The Lord Jesus Christ shall return visibly to the earth as the King of kings and Lord of lords, accompanied by His angels and the saints to rule this world for a period of one thousand years. This is known as the second coming of Christ. Those who could not be accessed by the agents of the antichrist with the marks of the Beast 666 and those who by all means rejected it, though sinners shall again replenish the earth for one thousand years with natural human race. The one thousand years reign over the earth in a physical sense is called the millennial reign. During this time Satan shall be bound and cast into the bottomless pit so that he will not deceive the people living on earth. The saints shall rule with Jesus over the present world. The headquarters of the world shall be Jerusalem from where Christ shall be ruling for one thousand years. This period shall be characterized by wonderful peace, prosperity, abundant blessings, joy and gladness. At the end of the one thousand years, Satan shall be loosed from the bottomless pit to return back to the earth. He will continue his deceptive work on the men of the earth. Many shall yield to him. He shall mobilize the natural men on earth to the battle of Gog and Magag against Christ and His saints. The Lord shall destroy them and bring an end to sin and rebellion forever and ever.  **\nMatthew 24 verse 30, 31  **\n30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. \n31 And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.   **\nRevelation 1 verse 5 to 7  **\n 5 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood, \n6 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and His Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. \n7 Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him, and they also which pierced Him, and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of Him. Even so, Amen.   **\nRevelation 20 verse 1 to 5   **\n1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. \n2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, \n3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled  and after that he must be loosed a little season. \n4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them, and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. \n5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.    **\nHell Fire For The Sinners   **\nJesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Hell fire is a real place of eternal fire, everlasting burning and torment reserved for the wicked. Satan, his demons and all sinners shall suffer everlasting damnation in the fire that burns with sulphur and brimstone. At the end of time, all sinners shall be resurrected back to life and shall be judged according to their works when they were alive on earth and shall be condemned into the lake of fire. Hell fire itself shall be cast into the lake of fire. The occupants of the lake of fire shall be Satan, demons or fallen angels and sinners. This shall be the end of all rebellion.   **\nMark 9 verse 43 to 48    **\n43 And if thy hand offends thee, cut it off, it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched; \n44 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. \n45 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off, it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched; \n46 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. \n47 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire;\n48 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.    **\nRevelation 20 verse 10 to 15   **\n10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night forever and ever. \n11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. \n12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened  and another book was opened, which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. \n13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them; and they were judged every man according to their works.\n14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. \n15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.   **\nHeaven  The Abode of Saints   **\nIsaiah 65 verse 17 to 19; second Peter 3 verse 9 to 14; Revelation 21 verse 1 to 27; Jesus Christ and the apostles preached that  Heaven is the abode of God, the headquarters of the universe. It is perfect, glorious, delightful, comfortable, holy and eternal. It is the abode of angels, living creatures and the saints who have left the earth. Jesus calls it ''My Father's house.” He has promised to prepare mansion in heaven for the righteous. God has other rewards in heaven for the righteous, including crowns and the privilege to sit with Him on His throne. Praise the Lord. The spirit and soul of every true and holy believer who dies on earth goes immediately into heaven for comfort, rest, joy and jubilation to await the resurrection of the righteous dead at the return of Christ, when they shall return to the earth to reunite with their body which shall assume a glorious eternal form resembling Christ's. At the end of the millennial reign, the Lord shall “create new heavens and a new earth.” This involves the renovation of the earth and the atmospheric heaven and the headquarters of the universe shall be New Jerusalem, which shall decent from heaven as a bride adorned for her husband. Here God shall live with the saints in everlasting joy and comforts.   **\nJohn 14 verse 1 to 3   **\n1 Let not your heart be troubled  ye believe in God, believe also in me. \n2 In my Father's house are many mansions  if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. \n3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.   **\nHebrews 11 verse 13 to 16   **\n13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.\n 14 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country. \n15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned. \n16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly, wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God  for he hath prepared for them a city  **\nEcclesiastes 12 verse 13, 14   **\n13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole m a t t e r, F e a r  G o d, and keep His commandments; for this is the whole duty of man. \n14 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil   **\nMay God bless your ministry and count you worthy for the reward, both on earth and in heaven, Amen.\n\n",

      "body": "SCRIPTURAL BURIAL CEREMONY IS A PERIOD OF MOURNING, NOT FEASTING FOR HOLY CHRISTIANS   **\nINTRODUCTION    **\n   \nEcclesiastes 7 verse 1 to 2    **\n A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth. \n2 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting  for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.  **\nThe above scripture reveals to us that death and burial ceremony among those that fear the Lord should be a time of sorrow and mourning and not a time of feasting and joyful celebration. \nAll through scripture, the events of death and burial ceremony have been moments of mourning and lamentation.   **\n \nSecond Samuel 1 verse 11 to 12, 17   **\n11\tThen David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise, all the men that were with him;\n12\tAnd they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. \n17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son   ** \nThe scripture says the day of death is better than the day of birth, because men regain their consciousness of God and of the eternal end of their souls at incidence of death and burial ceremony  through sober reflections and self-examination of their lives. \nAlas, today, the word of God has been ignored and laid aside. Christians are now following the world in their tradition and customs.    **\n \nBurial ceremony now is turned into occasions of feasting, dancing and celebration, not minding the eternal soul of the dead. The Lord is speaking through this book to His godly children not to follow the tradition and custom of the world.     **\n \nMany godly children of God are turned away from righteousness and holy living during burial ceremony. Some spend up all their earnings to honour the dead who may be in hell. They become poor, go into debt, hence, and become offensive even at God. Be instructed brother and sister, that you should return to scriptural burial ceremony to maintain righteousness and holiness before the Lord.    **\n \nFollow the teaching, instruction and counsel of this book to maintain God's righteousness and holiness in your life in cases of burial ceremony.  **\nPastor Paul Rika.  ** ** \n \nCHAPTER ONE  **\n\nYOU CAN CONDUCT BURIAL WITHOUT POLLUTING YOUR CHRISTIAN LIFE.  **\n \nGod wants to teach us His way and will concerning burial ceremonies. He does not want His people to follow the tradition and customs of the sinful world as it is practiced by many families, tribes, societies and nations. He does not want His children to be defiled during burial ceremonies. Many believers in Christ are not able to maintain their righteousness and holiness due to compromise with their family or society on occasions of burial. May this not be your case in Jesus name.  **\n\n\n\n1.1 Burial Ceremony among Christians.   **\n \nMatthew 28 verse 18 to 20.   **\n18\tAnd Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, all power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth.  \n19\tGo ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost   \n20\tTeaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you  and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.   **\n \n Here the Lord is saying, GO and PREACH and MAKE CONVERTS. When you have made the converts, MAKE THEM DISCIPLES, by TEACHING THEM ALL THE WORD OF GOD, whatsoever I have commanded you. He said to those who have believed on Him, “If ye continue in my word, then are ye My disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free” (John 8 verse 31 to 32).  \nPaul the Apostle said he had been teaching and warning every man that he might present everyone perfect in Christ Jesus. This is what we are doing to those who have come to the righteousness of Christ.  **\n  \nColossians 1 verse 28    **\n“Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus.”  **\n \nThe Lord is raising in this last days, a body of true believers in righteousness and holiness. These must be taught the word of God in all respects so that they can be perfect before God and be ready for the rapture. One of the things the Lord wants me to teach the believers at this time is on Christian burial ceremony. Believers of all races, tribes, and communities carry out burial ceremonies in various ungodly ways to the defilement of their lives, provoking the holy God to anger. Many believers living among their people in the world are not aware of God's standard on burial ceremonies. They follow the tradition of the land thus destroying their Christianity. When they die, they miss heaven because they have been defiled by the custom of the people around them.  **\nIsaiah 6 verse 1 to 6   **\n1\tIn the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.  \n2\tAbove it stood the seraphims, each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.  \n3\tAnd one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts  the whole earth is full of His glory.  \n4\tAnd the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.  \n5\tThen said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips  for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.  \n6\tThen flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.   **\n \n\"I dwell among the people of unclean lips and I am also a man of unclean lips.\" But the Lord wants you to be taught the truth so that, although you are in a corrupt and perverse world, you should shine as light having no spot or wrinkle,  **\n \nPhilippians 2 verse 15 and 16  **\n15\tThat ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;  \n16\tHolding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.  ** \n\n\nCHAPTER TWO  **\nBURIAL OCCASION IS A TIME OF SOBER REFLECTION  **\n \n2.1 There is a Time and Season to Everything.  **\n \nEcclesiastes 3 verse 1,2   **\n1\tTo everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. \n2\tA time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted.    **\n \nDeath is a common occurrence in the world. People of all kinds die; sinners and saints alike. This means you will experience deaths around you, including those of your family members, church members, friends, and other people in your society. You too will die in your time. Before your time comes, one reason or the other will make you attend burial ceremonies.  **\n \nEcclesiastes 7 verse2 to 5  **\n2\tIt is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting;  for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.  \n3\tSorrow is better than laughter,  for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.  \n4\tThe heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.  \n5\tIt is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.   **\n\n\n\n\n2.2 What the Scripture Says About the House of Bereavement?  **\n \nThis Scripture clearly relates to a burial ceremony. It defines a burial ceremony and gives the following description of it.  **\n \nI) It Is the House of Mourning.  **\nGenesis 37 verse 34 to 35  **\n34\tAnd Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.  \n35\tAnd all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.   **\n \nEcclesiastes 7 verse 4  **\n“The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.”   **\n \nAs we can see, the Bible tells us here that the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning because when he attends the burial ceremony of someone who has died, he is supposed to change his life and his foolish ways through meditating on the events surrounding the death. It is now turned into the house of celebration and joy where various kinds of foods and drinks are being served as in feasts. Music and dances are being employed for the people's pleasures. Some serve alcohol and make the people get drunk. They eat, drink and dance and forget the godly sorrow meant to change their lives through mourning for the dead.  **\n \nSecond Corinthians 7 verse 9 to 11  **\n9\tNow I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance; for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.  \n10\tFor godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of,  but the sorrow of the world worketh death.  \n11\tFor behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.  **\n \nii) It Is the House of Sadness.  ** \n \nLuke 24 verse 17 to 20  **\n17\tAnd He said unto them, what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?  \n18\tAnd the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto Him, Art Thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?  \n19\tAnd He said unto them, what things? And they said unto Him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;  \n20\tAnd how the chief priests and our rulers delivered Him to be condemned to death, and have crucified Him.   **\n \niii) It Is the House of Sorrow where people put on sorrowful and sober attitude.  **\nJohn 11 verse 33 to 36  **\n33\tWhen Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,  \n34\tAnd said, where have ye laid him? They said unto Him, Lord, come and see.  \n35\tJesus wept.  \n36\tThen said the Jews, Behold how He loved him!  **\n  \niv) It Is the House of Rebuke where God rebukes people of their wrong and evil ways.   **\n \nEcclesiastes 7 verse 4 and 5  **\n4\tThe heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.  \n5\tIt is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.  \nPsalm 39 verse 11 \nWhen thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth  surely every man is vanity.  **\n \n2.3 What A Bereaved Home is Not.  ** \nI) It is not the house of feasting where people eat, drink and dance with joy and shouting.  **\n Esther 9 verse 17 to 19   **\n17\tOn the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.  \n18\tBut the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.  \n19\tTherefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.  **\n ii) It is not the house of laughter where people crack jokes and laugh to forget their sorrows and the lessons God wants them to learn.  **\n\nJames 4 verse 9    **\n“ Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.”  **\nvii) It is not a place of careless living, where people commit various kinds of sins and blaspheme God.  **\nIsaiah 47 verse 8    **\n“Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children.”  ** ** \n\nCHAPTER THREE  **\n \nSINFUL MEN HAVE CORRUPTED BURIAL CEREMONY.   **\n \nIsaiah 1 verse 4    **\n“Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters, they have forsaken the Lord they have provoked the holy one of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.”  **\n \nFrom the above descriptions, you can see how many Christians have missed it. Many have missed what God ordains burial ceremony to be and to achieve in the hearts of men. God says it is the house of mourning. God expects people to go there to cry and mourn. Today culture, custom, tradition and churches have turned burial ceremony into feasting. It is a house to go in with sorrow and sober reflection. You are to go to burial ceremony with the questions  did he make it to heaven? Where is his soul now? Did he lived righteous and holy? If he died I his sins he is not with God now, but in hell fire.   **\n  \nHebrews 12 verse 14  **\n“Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.”  **\n Psalm 9 verse 17  **\n“The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.”  **\n \nAnother thing that should come to your mind is; if I die now, where will I go? Will my soul make heaven?   **\n \nPsalm 119 verse 59   **\n“I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.”   **\n \nAlas, the church has gone the way of the world and has turned the bereaved home to a Place of feasting, eating, dancing and rejoicing. They have no consideration that a soul has left the earth to eternity, and most probably, to eternity of everlasting hell. Remember what the Bible says about hell fire.  **\n \nMark 9 verse 43 to 48  **\n43\tAnd if thy hand offend thee, cut it off, it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched   \n44\tWhere their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.  \n45\tAnd if thy foot offend thee, cut it off, it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched   46 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.  \n47\tAnd if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire   \n48\tWhere their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.   **\n \n3.1 Reasons for Sorrowing Over the Dead.  ** \nThe following may account for the reason of people sorrowing over the dead  ** \n \ni)\tHis loved ones shall not see him on earth again.  **\n \nii)\tHis contribution to the blessing of his family, church and society shall not continue.  **\n \niii)\tMany people may go into suffering for his permanent absence.  **\n \niv)\twife is widowhood shall suffer.  ** \n \nv)\tHis children shall be fatherless.  **\n \nvi)\tHis good work in society shall not continue.  **\n \nvii)\tIf he died a sinner, he shall enter into the everlasting  \tjudgment of God in hellfire.  **\n \nviii)\tIf he died a believer, his ministry and kindness among believers have come   to an end.  **\n \nix)\tHe might have died untimely due to some unfortunate incident; hence people mourn over him for his misfortune in life.  **\nx)\tIf he died after a long sickness or hazard, people mourn over him in pity for what he suffered.  **\n \nxi)\tIf he died young, people mourn because he did not live his full years and so has contributed little or nothing to his family, the Church and human society.  **\n \nxii)\tThere are others reasons why people go into sorrow for the dead.  ** **\n \n\n\n\n CHAPTER FOUR  **\n\n4.1 Scriptural Caution on Believer`s Death  **\n \nFirst Thessalonians 4 verse 13 and 14  **\n13\tBut I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. \n14\tFor if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.  **\n \nThe Bible cautions believers in Christ on their sorrow over the death of a saint. The scripture tells us the following about those that die in Christ.  **\n \nI) those who die in Christ are taken away from evil to come. Their death is for their good.  **\n \nIsaiah 57 verse 1 and 2  **\n1\tThe righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart, and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.  \n2\tHe shall enter into peace; they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.  **\n\n Isaiah 26 verse 19     **\n“The dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing ye that dwell in dust, for thy dew is as the dew of the herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.”  **\n \nii) We Shall See Them Again in the Resurrection if they died in Christ`s righteousness and holiness.    **\n \nFirst Thessalonians 4 verse 13 to 18    **\n13\tBut I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.  \n14\tFor if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him.  \n15\tFor this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.  \n16\tFor the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God  and the dead in Christ shall rise first;  \n17\tThen we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.  \n18\tWherefore comfort one another with these words.   **\n \nJohn 11 verse 23 to 25   **\n23\tJesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.  \n24\tMartha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.  \n25\tJesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live    **\n \niii)\tIs The death of the saints precious to God. It is of joy to God and angels when a person dies in Christ and makes it to heaven.    **\nPsalm 116 verse 15  **\n“Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints.”   **  \n \nIsaiah 26 verse 20  **\n“Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be over past.   ** \n \niv)\tThey shall rise from the dead with glorious eternal body.   ** \nMark 12 verse 26 and 27    **\n26\tAnd as touching the dead, that they rise  have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  \n27\tHe is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living  ye therefore do greatly err.   **\n \nJohn 5 verse 25   **\n“Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.”    **  \n \nFirst Corinthians 15 verse 52    **\n“In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump  for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.”  ** \n \nFirst Timothy 2 verse 11   **\n“It is a faithful saying  For if we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him.”  ** \nRevelation 14 verse 13   **\n“And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth, Yea, saith the Spirit that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.”  ** ** \n\nCHAPTER FIVE  **\nGODLY PRINCIPLES DURING BURIAL    **\n \n5.1 Financial Burden on the Bereaved Family    **\n \nFirst John 2 verse 15 to 17    **\n15\tLove not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. \n16\tFor all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the father, but is of the world. \n17\tAnd the world passeth away, and the lust thereof, but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.   **\n  \nThe society has turned burial ceremony into feasting and prideful display of money and family wealth and the church allowed it so. Now, when someone dies in the family, apart from being sorrowful for the death, the family members also go into sorrow for the financial burden involved in the burial ceremony. Much money has to be gathered. The family must display their wealth to the society. They want to ensure that the ceremony is attended by as many people as possible. The family members sell their properties, take loans and borrow from individuals for the burial project. This is not the will of God. This worldly spirit in burial ceremony brings crises and hatred and causes many problems among the family members. After the burial, many go into regret on the huge amount of money they spent or borrowed for the burial project. Many in Christ are made to stumble in the faith by these things because they do not want to be left out.  **\nRomans 14 verse 13  **\n“Let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way. “  **\n \n5.2 Follow the Instruction of God.  **\nGod wants His children to be trained on the path of wisdom, knowledge and understanding in order to make them overcome the tradition and customs of men, masterminded by the devil. When you listen to God and maintain His ways you will enjoy peace and victory in your life.  **\n \nProverbs 4 verse 1 to 11  **\n1\tHear, ye children, the instruction of a Father, and attend to know understanding.  \n2\tFor I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not My law.  \n3\tFor I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.  \n4\tHe taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words  keep my commandments, and live.  \n5\tGet wisdom, get understanding forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.  \n6\tForsake her not, and she shall preserve thee, love her, and she shall keep thee.  \n7\tWisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom  and with all thy getting get understanding.  \n8\tExalt her, and she shall promote thee, she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.  \n9\tShe shall give to thine head an ornament of grace  a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.  \n10\tHear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.  \n11\tI have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.   **\n \nI) First of all, you must know that there is time for everything. There is time for feasting and there is time for sorrow. Burial ceremony is a time of sorrow. The spirit of feasting must not be introduced.  **\n  \nEcclesiastes 3 verse 1, 4   **\n1 To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven   \n4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.  **\n \nii) Know the activities to run in your burial ceremony to achieve the scriptural aim of the ceremony.  **\n \nEcclesiastes 7 verse 2,3  **\n2\tIt is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting, for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart \n3\tSorrow is better than laughter, for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better   **\niii)\tDo not change the burial ceremony into feasting by bringing in activities of feasting that make people forget what God designs the burial ceremony to achieve.   **\niv)\tDo not compete with others in the Excellency of your burial ceremony.  Put pride away from you, your family and the name of the dead.   **\nv)\tDo not introduce sinful things, sinful men and sinful society into your burial ceremony.  **\nJeremiah 10 verse 1, 2   **\n1\tHear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel   \n2\tThus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.   **\n \nvi). Do not participate in family burial where the members are worldly and are in conformity with the world. Be firm in your stand, but play wisely.   **\n \nMatthew 10 verse 16    **\n“Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves;  be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.”  **\nJoshua 24 verse 15   **\n“And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. “  **\n \n vii) Do not obey the ungodly demands of your family or the people of the land and do not fear their persecution, threats and witchcraft.    **\n \nActs 4 verse 18 to 21    **\n18\tAnd they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.  \n19\tBut Peter and John answered and said unto them, whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.  \n20\tFor we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.  \n21\tSo when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people for all men glorified God for that which was done.   **\n \nviii) Know that the Lord your God is with you always to protect, deliver, empower you, and to keep you holy for His name.    **\nPsalm 91 verse 1 to 16    **\n1\tHe that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  \n2\tI will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress,  my God; in Him will I trust.  \n3\tSurely He shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.  \n4\tHe shall cover thee with His feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust, His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.  \n5\tThou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;  \n6\tNor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.  \n7\tA thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.  \n8\tOnly with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.  \n9\tBecause thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;  \n10\tThere shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.  \n11\tFor He shall give His angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.  \n12\tThey shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.  \n13\tThou shalt tread upon the lion and adder; the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.  \n14\tBecause he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him, I will set him on high, because he hath known My name.  \n15\tHe shall call upon Me, and I will answer him, I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.  \n16\tWith long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.   **\n \n 5.3 Weep with Them That Weep.    **\n \nJeremiah 31 verse 15    **\n“Thus, saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.”  ** \n \nRoman 12 verse 15   **\n“Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.”    **\n Let us exercise this Christian spirit. There is a time of mourning and there is a time of rejoicing. In the above context, Rachael had lost her two children to sudden death. Christianity is calling upon you to join your sister to mourn over the death of her children. Believers should learn to join their brethren to mourn over the death of their close ones. Jesus came to the bereaved home of Martha and Mary to mourn with them and comfort them.  **\n \nJohn 11 verse 32, 33  **\n32\tThen when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  \n33\tWhen Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.    **\nMany do not bother. They do not bother to say a word of comfort to a bereaved person. They do not bother to send a text message to someone that lost a relation.  They do not bother to visit the bereaved to comfort them. The brother or sister is saying in their heart  “this is the time my brethren will come to comfort me.” Alas, nobody came! Believers who are close to the bereaved brethren but do not bother to visit them or say a word of love and comfort to them are erring. Learn to sympathize and empathize sorrow with your brethren which situation of life has made them sorrowful. Even Jesus attended a bereaved home to comfort those who were mourning. Let men and women in leadership learn to express this love and care to church members and leaders passing through sorrow because of hazards of life.   **\nLamentation 1 verse 12, 13   **\n12\tIs it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? Behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of His fierce anger.  \n13\tFrom above hath He sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them; He hath spread a net for my feet, He hath turned me back, He hath made me desolate and faint all the day.   **\n \n5.4 It is better to give to the bereaved than to receive from them.    **\n \nActs 20 verse 35    **\n“I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.”  \n \nLet those who come to the bereaved home to comfort them answer the following questions, having understood the state and condition of the bereaved well.   **\na)\tIs it the bereaved home that should supply food to everyone that comes to visit them or those coming to them that should come with food and money to support them?  **\n\n\n \nJob 42 verse 11   **\n“Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house; and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the Lord had brought upon him  every man also gave him a piece of money and every one an earring of gold” \nNote  that the earring of gold given to him was not for his use but for his treasure. Gold is malleable and this could be fashioned into other items for clean uses.    **\n \nb)\tIs it proper to go to the house of bereavement to collect gifts of various items as though they organized a feast for joyful celebration?   **\nThe scripture below shows that giving out gifts to others marks or characterize celebrations of joy and not of sorrow.    ** \nNehemiah 8 verse 9 to 12    **\n9\tAnd Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.  \n10\tThen he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared  for this day is holy unto our Lord, neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.  \n11\tSo the Levites stilled all the people, saying, hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.  \n12\tAnd all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.   **\nSharing of gifts is done during the period of joy and not during mourning. Hence, distributing clothes, plates and other items is not required during burial ceremony. Things like this are excesses that should be avoided in Christian burial ceremony in order not to conform to the world.    ** \n \n5.5 The bereaved family may share Bible and Christian materials.   **  \nc) Can the bereaved family share a copy of the Bible and Christian materials to those who come to comfort them? Yes, because the Bible or good Christian materials can produce conversion to Christ in those that receive and use them. This is the best thing to Christian burial ceremony.  **\nSecond Timothy 4 verse 1 to 4  **\n1\tI charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom;  \n2\tPreach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.  \n3\tFor the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;  \n4\tAnd they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. **  **\nCHAPTER SIX    **\nEMPATHISE WITH BEREAVED FAMILIES    **\n \n6.1    Jesus' Visit to A Bereaved Family.    ** \n \nJohn 11 verse 14, 17    **\n14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.  \n17 Then when Jesus came, He found that he had lain in the grave four days already.  ** \nMartha, Mary and Lazarus were disciples of Jesus. When Lazarus died, Jesus visited the family to comfort them. His words, emotional display and actions gave them deep comfort. Christian leaders must learn this from Jesus. Make effort to give personal and practical comfort to bereaved brethren.  **\nJohn 11 verse 32, 33   **\n32\tThen when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  \n33\tWhen Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, He groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.    **\n \nWho is more righteous than Jesus? Who is more knowledgeable than Jesus? But here we see Jesus expressing heart pain and heart sorrow. He did not come to advertise His credentials as a man of faith who has authority to raise the dead. He did not come to them with the air of greatness to command attention to Himself. He came to empathize with the bereaved brethren. He came there to mourn with those that mourn. He came to identify with them in their pain and sorrow.  **\n \nJohn 11 verse 36 to 38  **\n36\tThen said the Jews, Behold how He loved him!  \n37\tAnd some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?  \n38\tJesus therefore again groaning in Himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.   **\n \n6.2 Jesus Wept (John 11 verse 35).  ** \nJesus wept aloud and people heard Him. Tears run down from His eyes. The Jews, the unbelievers, saw the full identification of Jesus with the bereaved brethren. See what they said, Behold how He loved him! \nLove is not only in words, but in action and sincerity.  ** \n  \nFirst John 3 verse 18 “My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth”.  \nWhat Jesus did will require humility in our lives.  So, it is good to attend a burial ceremony of loved ones and of Christian brethren. Visiting a bereaved family is a commendable thing. It offers us opportunity to comfort the sorrowful by mourning and weeping with them. Let us, as much as it is possible, go personal and practical in the comfort of our fellow brethren.  There are times the circumstance may not require our personal presence. We should try to delegate others to do this for us.  **\nPhilippians 2 verse 19   **\n“But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.”  \nNot only should we visit the bereaved home for condolence, we should be there in the right spirit, to meditate on our life, on the time of our death and on the eternal life or eternal damnation hereafter before all men.  **\n \nEcclesiastes 7 verse 2   **\n“It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting,  for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.” \n \n6.3 The Heart of Mourning is Required in Burial Ceremony.  **   \n  \nThe scripture shows clearly that burial ceremony is a mourning time. Consider a few examples   **\n \nGenesis 50 verse 10, 11  **\n10\tAnd they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation  and he made a mourning for his father seven days.  \n11\tAnd when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians; wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.   **\nDeuteronomy 43 verse 8  **\n“And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.” \nHowever, the scripture exhorts that mourning over the death of a saint should be with control because we shall see them again at the resurrection.   **\n FIRST  Thessalonians 4 verse 13, 14   **\n13\tBut I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.  \n14\tFor if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him.   **\n \nThis is the reason why you must work on the salvation of your loved ones so that when they die you may sorrow with hope. You too labour to serve the Lord Jesus in righteousness and holiness so that when you die your loved ones will be comforted in hope. \nNow the question is, if sorrow and sadness can be expressed at believers' death and ceremony, can a burial ceremony of a sinner whose soul is in hell be celebrated with dances and joy and giving out gifts to invitees?   **\n  \nLuke 16 verse 22 to 24, 27, 28   **\n22\tAnd it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. the rich man also died, and was buried;  \n23\tAnd in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.  \n24\tAnd he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.  \n27\tThen he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house;  \n28\tFor I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.   **\nEzekiel 33 verse 11   **\n“Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live; turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? “  **\nMark 9 verse 43, 44    **\n43\tAnd if thy hand offend thee, cut it off, it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched; \n44\tWhere their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.  ** \n \nIs God pleased with this joyful celebration?  **\nPaul said, that Epaphroditus was sick unto death but God healed him and showed Paul mercy for that; otherwise, he would have had sorrow upon sorrow.  **\n \nPhilippians 2 verse 25 to 25  **\n25\tYet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.  \n26\tFor he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.  \n27\tFor indeed he was sick nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.   **\n \nNow, if we can have sorrow over a believer or a true man of God that dies and mourn for him as Jesus wept over righteous Lazarus, can we agree that the death of a sinner whose soul is in hell fire and is passing through the torments of hell should be celebrated with dances, joy, and giving of gifts and souvenirs to people, or killing cows, goats and chickens; eating and drinking in pleasure? If the person is your relation, will you go into merry-making and employ comedians to crack jokes to make people laugh? Will that not be a great mockery over the dead? Jesus is lamenting over a soul He lost to hell, you are celebrating over his life. Can you be blameless before God for doing that? Those who do second and third burial to celebrate the dead are sinners and idol worshipers who are ignorant of what they are doing. Do not join them nor contribute money for such.   **\n \nProverbs 24 verse 17, 18    **\n17\tRejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth;  \n18\tLest the LORD see it, and it displease Him, and He turn away His wrath from him.   **\n \nJob 31 verse 28, 29  **\n28\tThis also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge;  for I should have denied the God that is above.  \n29\tIf I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him.  **\nFirst Corinthians 13 verse 6\n“Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.”  **\n \n6.4 What Sinners Do in their Ignorance?  **\nEphesians 2 verse 17, 18  **\n17\t And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.  \n18\t For through Him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.  **\nWhen a person dies, sinners see it as an opportunity to gather together to celebrate the death with feasting. They bring in musicians to sing for them. They celebrate the dead with dances and pleasures. They wear uniform attires with imprinted picture of the deceased, who is suffering in hell. They do not mourn for him but rejoice over a suffering soul. They are ignorant of the eternal state of an unsaved soul. They will often say among themselves, “May his soul rest in peace.” They do not know that there is no peace for the sinner. They are not aware of the eternal damnation of a soul that died without Jesus! Without His righteousness! \nThe radical Christians the Lord is raising up in our generation in this end time will say no to pollution in burial ceremony. Take the position of the scripture in the burial ceremony of your relatives or anyone. Do not follow the people of the world in their sinful and ignorant deeds. Do not go to collect gifts or take souvenirs home from a burial ceremony except what will promote the name of the Lord Jesus. Why should you collect gifts over the death of drunkards, fornicators, thieves, witches and wizards? Some sinners in their pride boast that they bury their dead with live cow, a car or expensive jewels. Some boast about the price of the gold-plated casket they buried their dead. Do not follow this worldly spirit of burial anymore. If you did this before, repent of it now. If the wearing of uniform clothe is in the simple spirit to identify family members or for any acceptable reasons, it`s alright. Do not yield to family pride of display of wealth and greatness. Abstain from all acts of evil.  **\n \nFirst Thessalonians 5 verse 22.  **\n“Abstain from all appearance of evil.”  **\n \nActs 17 verse 30   **\n“And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent.”  **\nFirst Peter 1 verse 14 to 16  **\n14\t As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance   \n15\t But as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;  \n16\tBecause it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.  **\n \n\nCHAPTER SEVEN  **\nCASE STUDY OF BELIEVER'S DEATH AND BURIAL IN SCRIPTURE    **\n \nJohn 11 verse 1 to 3, 14, 19 to 27, 32, 40, 43 to 45  **\n1\tNow a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.  \n2\t(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)  \n3\tTherefore his sisters sent unto Him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest is sick.  \n11  These things said He; and after that He saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.  \n12 Then said His disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.  \n13\tHowbeit Jesus spake of his death  but they thought that He had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. \n14\tThen said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.  \n15\tAnd I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.  \n19\tAnd many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.  \n20\tThen Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met Him, but Mary sat still in the house.  \n21\tThen said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  \n22\tBut I know, that even now, whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee.  \n23\tJesus saith unto her, thy brother shall rise again.  \n24\tMartha saith unto Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.  \n25\t Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life; he that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; \n26\t And whosoever liveth and believeth in Me shall never die. Believest thou this?  \n27\t She saith unto Him, Yea, Lord; I believe that Thou art the Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.  \n32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet, saying unto Him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.  \n40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?  \n43\tAnd when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.  \n44\tAnd he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.  \n45\tThen many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on Him.   **\n \nSIMPLE BURIAL CEREMONY IN SCRIPTURE.  ** \n \nRomans 15 verse 4  **\n“Who have for my life laid down their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.” \nHere is a biblical example of the burial ceremony of a believer. See the way the believer conducts burial ceremony of a relation. If maybe, it is your child or wife that died, and you are in a position to exercise power over the burial, make it a Christian burial.  **\n \n7.1 See the Simple Burial Ceremony for Lazarus.   ** \n \nWhen Lazarus died, the relations, friends, neighbors and loved ones were informed as many as the bereaved family could contact. The church leadership got the information, hence Jesus too was informed. Lazarus, Mather and Mary were living in their family house. Lazarus was buried in the family house. It is common in every community that a general place of burial is provided for those who have no suitable place to bury their dead. Such a place can be used to bury any believer that dies.  \nWe must avoid the tradition of conveying the dead to his family which may be too far away, that a huge amount of money has to be spent in transportation. The gospel of Jesus and the relations alive need more money than the dead. The place and cost of burial does not affect the eternal state of the dead. This is a good practice observed by sinners, how much more the believers. \nMany came to the family to witness the burial and to comfort the bereaved.  **\nJohn 11 verse 19  **\n“And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.”  \nDid they come to eat and drink? What did they come to do? They came to comfort the bereaved family. After the burial ceremony, did they go home with souvenirs? The sincere neighbor would rather support them with money or foodstuff to help them feed those that came to comfort them, who may have to stay for a longer period. This is done to ease the bereaved family of extra burden.  **\n 7.2 Immediate Burial of the Dead Body.   **  \nJohn 11 verse 6  **\n“When He had heard therefore that he was sick, He abode two days still in the same place where He was.” \nIt appears when Jesus heard that Lazarus was sick, that same day he died. Meanwhile, Jesus stayed back where He was two more days. That means He continued His journey back to Judea on the third day and arrived on the fourth day. We can deduce that Lazarus was buried the same day he died.   ** \nJohn 11 verse 39    **\n“Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto Him, Lord, by this time he stinketh;  for he hath been dead four days.”   **\nWhy did they not leave Lazarus's body unburied waiting for Jesus to come and see him before burying him? What you see today is that when a man dies, they will not bury him until his son in England or the daughter in America or the other one in Russia or Cameroon comes home. Why are you practicing delayed burial to keep people in suspense? This is done no doubt to have time enough to gather money and invite multitude of people for family display of wealth for fame Be informed that the believers in Christ time and in the early church did not practice that. They buried their dead immediately as we can see in the case of Lazarus.   **\n \nThe believer is a steward of God`s money and material resources. He must not waste it over that which has lower value than the spread of gospel of Christ, the Lord will hold him guilty for wasting His resources on unnecessary cost tantamount to waste.  **\nLuke 9 verse 60  **\n“Jesus aid unto him let the dead bury their dead  but go thousand preach the kingdom of God”  **\n\n\n \nPROPER COUNSEL IS REQUIRED FOR ANY EXCEPTIONAL CASE.   **\n \nProverbs 10 verse 14   **\n“Wise men layup knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction”  ** \nAGAIN, CONSIDER THE CASE OF TABITHA (DORCAS)  **\nActs 9 verse 36 to 43  **\n36\t Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas, this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.  \n37\tAnd it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died, whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.  \n38\t And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.  \n39\t Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber; and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.  \n40\t But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes  and when she saw Peter, she sat up.  \n41\t And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.  \n42\t And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.  \n43\tAnd it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.   **\n \nCertainly, Tabitha would have been buried that day except that she was raised back to life by Peter the same day she died. When was Jesus buried? The very day He died. Why do some believers delay their dead for days, weeks, months, and years after the pattern of the celebrative world? Again do not waste money in mortuary expenses, unnecessary conveyance of the dead to long distance to your impoverishment and that of family members. You cannot loved the deceased more than Jesus. Obey Jesus and have his peace and blessing. first Corinthians 4 verse 1,2    **\nEphesians 5 verse 15 to 17  **\n15 See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,  16 Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.  \n17 Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.  **\n \n7.3 Ungodly Reasons for Delayed Burial.  **\nThe people of the world delay burying their dead relatives for the following reasons   **\ni)\tTo raise sufficient money to convey the corpse to their desired destination.  **\nii)\tTo prepare the home or burying-place to meet the standard required for human praise and commendation.  **\niii)\tTo plan for high-class burial in order to show the status of the family in society competition with others.   **\niv)\tTo gather sufficient money in order to celebrate the burial ceremony  v) To plan for proper entertainment of invitees.  **\nvi) To provide quality souvenirs for the participants.  ** vii) To waste family resources on their dead for their pride.  **\nThese involve huge financial contributions, borrowings and going into burial contracts with others to support them so that they too will reciprocate the gesture when it gets to their turn to do burial. This is not the will of God. If sinners will do this, let not the believers join them to waste precious time and resources that God has given them.  ** \nLuke 9 verse 59 to 60   **\n59\tAnd He said unto another, Follow He. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.  \n60\tJesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead  but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.     **\n \nBelievers must spend both time and money paramountly on the spread of the gospel of the Lord Jesus which gives salvation from sin, Satan and eternal death and gives eternal life to souls. If the dead person has gone to hell, what meaning do you give to this excessive time and money spent? Even if the soul has gone to heaven, is it worth all these troubles \nHowever, if a few days of preparation are required to secure a burying place or for vital preparation, that is acceptable. The believer must always seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit and counsel of sound Christians.  **\n \n7.4 Formal Burial Ceremony   **\nGenesis 49 verse 33; 50 verse 1 to 13.   **\n34\tAnd when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.\n50 1 And Joseph fell upon his father`s face, wept upon him and kissed him \n2\tAnd Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father, and the physicians embalmed Israel. \n3\tAnd forty days were fulfiller for him  for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed, and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days. \n4\tand when the days of mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharoah, saying, if now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharoah, saying \n5\tmy father made me swear, saying lo I die  in my grave which I have digged for    me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou burry me, now therefore, let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. \n5\tAnd Pharaoh said, go up and bury your father, according as he made thee swear. \n6\tAnd Joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt \n7\tAnd all the house of Joseph, and his brethren and his father`s house; only there little ones and their flocks and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen \n8\tAnd there went up with him both chariots and horsemen  and it was a very great company. \n9\tAnd they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation and he made a mourning for his father seven days  \n10\tAnd when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, this is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians, wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan 11 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them \n12 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of the burying place of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.   **\nWe recognize the death and burial ceremony of State men and women who require the attention of the society and the government. This are men and women of high stance and fame.  **\n \nThe case of Jacob in scripture was that of State burial, the following things are observed in the death and burial of Jacob   **\ni.\tJoseph went over the dead body of his father verse 1.  **\nii.\tJacobs burial was State burial and was taken over by the Government of Egypt in Joseph`s time verse 4 to 9.   **\niii.\tJacob made joseph to swear that he would be buried in the land of Canaan. This request was according to the will of God, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. These were all buried in the land of Canaan the land of promise. It is not everybody that will give the condition for his burial that needs to be obeyed, because his demands may not be in accordance to God`s word or will. Verse 4.   **\niv.\tJacob`s burial ceremony was characterized by weeping and mourning and not feasting verse 10.  **\nv.\tNote that apart from Jacob`s peculiar case, there is no record in scripture that children of Israel were always conveyed to the land of Canaan wherever they died.  ** **\n \n \nCHAPTER EIGHT  **\nCHRISTIAN ACTIVITIES AND PROCEDURES FOR BURIAL  **\n \n 8.1 Burial Arrangements Should Not Be Made to Be Complicated.  ** \nA burial ceremony can be as simple as this  **\ni) The mourners and comforters should be led to the presence of God in prayer.    ii) They should be led into praise and worship.  **\niii)\tThe bereaved family members may be called out for an introduction to the people.  **\niv)\tAn appointed person may come before the congregation to read the biography of the deceased.  **\nv)\tAn appointed Minister may come forward to preach the word of God to the audience.   vi) The congregation should be made to pray for the bereaved family members.   **\nvii) The people should then move to the grave for the internment, to lower the coffin into the grave.   **\nSome culture requires the wife and others to throw some earth into the grave to signify that his body has gone back to the dust where it came from.  **\nEcclesiastes 12 verse 7      **\n“Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.”   ** \nI) Refreshment may be provided for the people. If the family or any member of the family has money or resources, it should be spent on organizing crusades or edifying program for the salvation and edification of the people that come for the burial program.    **\nii)\tIf there is enough money to give souvenirs to the people, it should be to get Christian materials that is of spiritual benefits to the souls of men. In this way, the burial ceremony of a Christian family is accomplished to the glory of God.  **\niii)\tSome family members and loved ones may want to stay in the bereaved home for some days. There is no problem in that. Some families use burial time to settle scores and to discuss on family peace and progress. This also is good. But all things should be done to the glory of God.  **\n \nFirst Corinthians 10 verse 31    **\n“Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.”  **  \n \nFirst Corinthians 14 verse 14    **\n“Let all things be done decently and in order”  ** \n \n8.2   Seek to Please God in the Burial.   **\nThe main person you should seek to please is God. The main person you should fear and refuse to disappoint is God, not man.   **\nGalatians 1 verse 10, 11   **\n10\tFor do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.  \n11\tBut I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.  **\n \nIf it is in your power to handle the burial ceremony, do not go about begging for money or allow your family members to do that. Let those who want to assist do so willingly. Do not be flamboyant in the burial ceremony. Direct and control all things according to scripture and let Jesus be glorified. Where the believer is not in control of the unbelieving family members and relations, then the believer should contribute that which is in the light of the scriptures and stop there. They may come up with a large sum to be contributed you must give just that which you can afford for the simple burial of a relation and stop there. Your money is accountable to God. Do not become afraid of witches and wizards in your family, or in the village or the society. Let men and Satan be embarrassed by you for not submitting to the ungodly tradition and custom of the world. Do not embarrass God. Do not backslide from your precious faith because of a burial ceremony.  **\n \nProverbs 23 verse 26    **\n“ My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.”  **\nProverbs 24 verse 21    **\n“ My son, fear thou the LORD and the king  and meddle not with them that are given to change.” \nIf you will overcome the many temptations of burial ceremony, God will be glad with you.  **\nFirst Peter 3 verse 13 to 17    **\n13\tAnd who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?  \n14\tBut and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye  and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;  \n15\tBut sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear; \n16\t Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.  \n17\t For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing. \nWho will harm you when you follow divine instructions backed up by divine power?  **\nLuke 10 verse 18 to 20    **\n18\tAnd he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.  \n19\tBehold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy  and nothing shall by any means hurt you.  \n20\tNotwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.  **  \n \nIsaiah 54 verse 14 to 17   **\n14\tIn righteousness shalt thou be established,  thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear,  and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.  \n15\tBehold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me  whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake.  \n16\tBehold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.  \n17\tNo weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD. \nWill you please God or men? If you will please men, then you are not a servant of Christ. Do not fear the anger and accusation of your family members. Back up your works with fervent prayers and bind the authority of darkness and subdue them.  **\nSecond Corinthians 10 verse 3 to 6   **\n“For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh;  \n(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)  \nCasting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;  \nAnd having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.”  \nThe overcoming Spirit is in you. You are born of God and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in them. Many will follow your good example and will be delivered from hell by watching your exemplary life.  **  **\n \n \n\n\nCHAPTER NINE  **\nGOD`S WORD ON THE WIDOWS AND THE FATHERLESS   **\n \n9.1 What The Widow Should Know   **\nColossians 2 verse 6 to 8   **\n6\tAs ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in Him;  \n7\tRooted and built up in Him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.  \n8\tBeware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. \n  Maintain your life of righteousness and holiness. Be guided by the word of God in everything. Walk in the liberty of Christ and do not submit yourself to customs and traditions of men over your dead husband which are opposed to the word of God.  **\nGalatians 5 verse 1    **\n“Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.”  **  \n \nDo not submit to rules such as   **\ni)\tCutting yourself, or printing any marks on your body, or wearing only one cloth for a stipulated period of time, or wearing only black cloth, or cutting your hair, or remaining indoors for a period of time, or whatever the ungodly tradition may demand. These are not required of you from the Lord. Therefore, refuse to do them.  **\nLeviticus 19 verse 28    **\n“Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you  I am the LORD.”   ** \nii)\tAppearing before an idol or swear by it for any cause. Don't submit to it even in the face of threat or pressure.  ** \niii)\tTransferring your marital relationship to another relation of your dead husband. Your marital relationship to that family and the dowry paid on you ended at the death of your husband. At the death of your husband, there family has no marital power over you anymore. The person that should give you husband now is God and the man must be a true Christian who will pay a new dowry or bride price on you.  **\nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 39, 40   **\n39\tThe wife is bound by the law, as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to marry whom she will; only in the Lord \n40\tbut she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment and I think also that I have the Spirit of God   **\n \n9.2 Proper Treatment of Widows and the Fatherless.   **\nThe Lord Himself is the Husband of the widows and the Father of the fatherless.  **\nPsalm 68 verse 5    **\n“A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.”  \nHe cares for the widows and the fatherless. Hence, He does not want any person or family to maltreat a widow or the fatherless because the head of the household has died and they have no one else to protect them. God places a curse upon oppressors of the widow and the fatherless.  **\nDeuteronomy 27 verse 19    **\n“Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.”  \nChildren of God and those of you that have the fear of God, do not oppress your brother's wife and his children after his death. As much as it lies within your power, do not allow any of your family members to do so either. It is evil in the sight of God and will incur His wrath upon the family.  **\n \nExodus 22 verse 22   **\n“Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.”  **\nJob 22 verse 9   **\n“Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.”   **\n9.3 God`s Warning Against Evil Treatment of Widows and The Fatherless.   ** \nEphesians 4 verse 17 to 24   **\n17\tThis I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,  \n18\tHaving the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart;  \n19\tWho being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.  20  But ye have not so learned Christ;  \n21\tIf so be that ye have heard Him, and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus;  \n22\tThat ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;  \n23\tAnd be renewed in the spirit of your mind;  \n24\tAnd that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.  **\n  \n1.\tAvoid doing wickedness against the family of the dead. Avoid wickedness against the widow (the wife of the dead) and against the fatherless (the children of the dead).   **\n2.\tAvoid greed and covetousness against the late man's money and property that he has gathered for his family. Sinners will run after those property and will say, “No burial until you bring the bank account” or until they are able to take all the property. They have no feeling or human sympathy. They are on queue for divine judgment. Do not join them to do treachery against the widow. The woman has children, and now you want to take all the property from the house, claiming they are your brother's. Did your brother acquire them for you? Who will cater for the needs the children? It is all wickedness!   **\nIf you overcome that woman because you say she is a weak woman, the God of the widows will fight for her and deal with you. You may be stronger than her, but there is somebody stronger than you too. You want to put her to shame? God of the widow will put you to shame too. Will you not have sympathy for the deceased's children on how they will live and survive? Child of God do not join those wicked people because you are a child of God. If there is anything the woman will give to assist you, let her give it willingly. If you will need to make any request, let it be done with gentleness and not with force. Even if the woman did not have any child for the man, the fact remains that she laboured with her husband for all these years to acquire the property. Will she therefore not have her portion? Has she also died the day the husband died? Will she not live and eat? Everything should be settled amicably and to her satisfaction even if she decides to go back to her father's house or marry another person. Be just and fair to her so that God would bless your family. I speak to those related to her husband who have the fear of God.  **\n John 13 verse 17   **\n“If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.”  \nBe as the Psalmist that said, I am purposed that my lips shall not transgress. Also be like Daniel who refused to defile himself with what was going on in the college.  ** **\n \n \nCHAPTER 10  **\nDIVINE REVELATION OF A BACKSLIDER THAT WENT TO HELL   **\n \nMy name is Sis Linda Paul Rika.  I am sharing with you a revelation the Lord Jesus showed me on the 9th of April, 2014 about late pastor Moses Semeka. Late pastor Moses Semeka was a pastor and member of Deeper Life Bible Church. He was also a Coordinator in Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, non-denominational.  **\n \n10.1 The Voice Keeps Telling Me That Moses Semeka Missed Heaven.  ** \nAfter the death of Pastor Moses Semeka in June 2013, I began to hear a voice witnessing to me that he missed heaven. I rebuked the voice because I said the pastor was a holy man. I also noted that God gave him a long time on the sick bed for repentance and restitution. We even visited him in two of the hospitals where he was admitted in Abuja. I concluded that the voice was from Satan because the pastor knew all the doctrines of holiness and was among those teaching others.  I resisted that voice because I doubted that it was not God speaking to me. But this voice kept coming back to me even when I was working in the kitchen, or taking my bath, or talking to people. The voice kept telling me that the pastor was in hell.  **\n Hebrew 12 verse 14   **\n“Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.”  **\nJob 13 verse 16   **\n“He also shall be my salvation, for an hypocrite shall not come before him.” \nI said to myself, what kind of thing is this? I was not so close to this pastor because I came to Nigeria in April 2013 and he died in June that same year. Why was I thinking like this? It was not even that I kept his death scene in my mind that should make me to be thinking about him. Daddy Paul Rika only told us about his death when we were in Kaduna and we prayed about it and I forgot all about it. but, this voice continued and I kept rebuking it. On 9th of April, 2014, I and my husband, Pastor Paul Rika, were praying together in the morning at about 7 30am. As we were singing the thought came back again  Moses Semeka missed heaven. My husband wanted to take a prayer point, but I interrupted him and said he should wait. I told him about the things happening to me after he told us about the death of the Pastor Moses Semeka. I told him that a voice kept telling me that the pastor was in hellfire. As I was explaining to pastor Rika, I heard the voice telling me again, \n“You don't believe what I am saying to you that Moses Semeka missed heaven? Now, \nI will make you hear him live from hell so that you will know it is true.”   **\nMatthew 24 verse 51    **\n“And shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”  ** \n \n10.2 Moses Semeka Received God`s Judgment on His Sins.  ** \nImmediately, I started hearing the decree of judgment against him. I heard a voice was asking Pastor Moses Semeka questions and I recognized it as the voice of the Lord Jesus.  \nThe first question was  Why were you not serious with your Christian life? Why were you careless with My work?  \nPastor Rika sat close by my side, but because the Lord's voice was mighty and terrible, I couldn't hear him again. Then I heard the voice of Pastor Moses Semeka replying in a sad and sorrowful way, “Lord, I was working in Your Movement and was attending Your holy Church, Deeper Life Bible Church. I read my Bible and fellowshiped with Your holy people. I paid my tithes and offerings. I know You, Lord \nJesus. Have mercy on me.”  **\n\n Matthew 7 verse 21 verse 23   **\n21\tnot every one that saith unto me Lord, Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. \n22\tMany will say to me in that day, Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name? \nAnd in thy name have cast out devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? \n23\tAnd then will I profess unto them unto them, I never knew you, depart from me, ye that worked iniquity    ** \nAnd the terrible voice said, “You said you know Me, Moses Semeka? Which way did you know Me? Which way did you benefit Holiness Revival Movement and the Church you were worshipping with in My name? How was your life impacted as you were still in your sins?” And the Pastor replied; “Lord, I was planning to pay my debt, do my restitutions and put my life right but death came upon me. Lord, have mercy.”   **\nFirst Thessalonians 5 verse 2,3    **\n“For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night. \nFor when they shall say, peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.”  ** \n \nAND THE LORD JESUS PRONOUNCED UPON HIM JUDGMENT THUS   **\n“You failed to keep My word. I sent several messages to the world saying Holiness Revival Movement is My movement, but you were playing with My word as though I was a man like you. You did not promote My Movement. You did not win souls as I expected of you. You feared man and still held onto your sins, Moses. You failed to follow peace with all men. You carried secret sins that men did not know about, but I your Creator knew what you were hiding. Everything a man does, I know; even things that you forgot, I the Lord know. I sent a message to Deeper Life Bible Church to warn them of My judgment but they would not hear. They neglected it because of the fear of man. Now, you are here like many of them. Who will save you now Moses? \nI showed you mercy by giving you the good privilege to cleanse yourself from your secret sins and perfect your life, yet you held unto your sins. Moses, is your time in your hand or My hand? Now you are here, there is no more mercy. Depart from Me Moses Semeka! Hell is the place for all disobedient children.”  **\n \n Psalm9 verse 17    **\n“The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.” \nSuddenly, I heard the voice of Pastor Moses shouting, “Have mercy; Lord, have mercy; Lord, have mercy.” Then I stopped hearing him. What I heard next were cries of multitudes in hell fire. After I heard the cries, I fell in the hands of my husband, telling him, “Cover my ears; cover my ears; I don't want to hear from hell;” because the sounds from hell were very terrible.  (Hebrew 10 31)    **\nSuddenly, I heard a voice distinct from the other voices I was hearing from hell. The voice started calling my name, “Sister Linda, Sister Linda, forgive me. I was not convinced about your testimony. Ohhh, tell our Sister to forgive me. Ah, Lord, it's painful here. My heart was bitter against her. Lord have mercy. I had secret sins in my life while among you in Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. Ah, Lord, have mercy; what have I done to myself? I did not pay the debt I owed some people. I have the sin of unforgiveness, and the Lord judged me for failing to follow peace with all men. Oh God have mercy! Why did I live carelessly in my Christian life? See me now; I am in pain. This place is too painful; Lord, have mercy on me.  ** \nLuke 16 verse 24   **\n“And he cried and said Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.” \nI was backbiting and gossiping people with some of my friends within and outside Holiness Revival Movement. Tell them to stop because God sees everything. Oh! \nEven my wife, I failed to nurture her in the fear of the Lord, to keep His ways. I encouraged my wife in sin. See me now suffering. Pray for me. Lord, have mercy.”  \nWhen he had said all these, I started hearing him grinding his teeth and crying bitterly.   ***\nMathew 13 verse 50    **\n“And shall cast them into the furnace of fire,  there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”  ** \n \n10.3 Moses Semeka Sent Admonishments.  ** \n \nMoses Semeka Continued,  **  \n“Tell my wife to forgive the people she is bitter with. Tell her to forgive my friends and other relations she is bitter with. Tell her to pay all her debts and immerse herself in the teaching and activities of Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide in life and practice. If you are not promoting or serious with Holiness Revival Movement or with your Christian life, please my people, do it now so that you will not come to hell. Hell is painful. O Lord, have mercy on me. God loves this Movement and judges people because of it. \n  \nTell Daddy Rika that I am sorry. I was not committed to the spreading of Holiness Movement because of Deeper Life persecution. Tell him to pray for me. It is painful here. Pray that God should send me back as He did to Sister Linda and Brother Michael Sambo, so that I may warn the world of hell fire. It is too much here Daddy.” \nThen I started hearing him saying things in his \n“Tiv” language which I didn't understand.  \nThereafter, he said, “Tell the Coordinators in Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide to immerse themselves in the teaching of the Movement. Let them take the teaching seriously and change their lives. Let them not come to hell. They should take the Movement as their ministry because God judges people for it. How serious are you with God's Movement?  \nWarn Deeper Life Bible Church. Many of their members are here in hell and others are also trooping in here. They will suffer God's judgment if they do not repent for the following reasons   **\ni.\tThere is lack of true Christian love in their lives.  **\nii.\tThey are proud of their Christian lives, seeing themselves as superior to other Christians.   **\niii.\tMany of their members have secret sins.  iv. \tThey do not win souls to Christ.  ** \n \nThis judgment is pronounced by the Lord Himself on those Deeper Life members here who come to hell. Tell Deeper Life Bible Church that these are some of the reasons why their members end up in hellfire. Tell them the devil is laughing at us by saying I have cast the spell of fear into the Deeper Life Bible Church and I have held them in captivity to the fear of man. They do not know that they have failed the commandments of God already. Because of that, many of them are coming to hell. Satan is laughing at our damnation and is calling us fools. Tell them to win souls and love other Christians. They should put away all manner of secret sins and work out their salvation individually. They should go out and evangelize and put away from them the fear of man. They should be serious about their Christian life.   **\n \n10.4 Remarks on Moses Semeka.   ** \n My fellow brethren, this is the message from hell. Why is Jesus doing this? He is making all effort to make sure we go to heaven. Please, if you are under the denominational power of man, or the fear of man, you are endangering yourself. Our late pastor Moses was a pastor under Deeper Life but denomination did not save him because of the fear of man. He failed to do the will of God. He feared what the denominational Church or Pastor would do to him, if he carried out the will of God in Holiness Revival Movement.   **\n \nFirst John 4 verse 18;    **\nThere is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear,  because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.  **\nProverbs 29 verse 25    **\n“The fear of man bringeth a snare; but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.”  **\n  \n10.5   Burial Ceremony of Moses Semeka.  ** \nEcclesiastes 7 verse 2 to 4  **\n2\tIt is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart. \n3\tSorrow is better than laughter; for by sadness o the countenance the heart is made better  \n4\tThe heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.  **\n \nThe story of Moses Semeka is well known to me the writer. Moses Semeka, a Tiv man from Benue State, Nigeria, was a member of Deeper Life Bible church Makurdi, and one of the Pastors. When he joined Holiness Movement, I made him Benue State Coordinator of Holiness Revival Movement. He showed much zeal but died after a long sickness. \nSister Linda Paul Rika is my wife. She received this divine experience from Jesus right in my presence. The main thing of consideration here is on burial ceremony  **\n \ni.\tShould his body be kept long in the mortuary in preparation for a great burial ceremony?  **\nii.\tShould all family money, including borrowing and loan be used to give him great burial?  **\niii.\tShould there be eating and drinking in feasting with dances in celebration at burial ceremony? iv. Should there be second burial, third burial be conducted on him?   **\nv. \tWould God be happy and glorified if this things were done on one in hell fire for his judgment.\n vi. \tGod`s ways are different from man`s ways.   **\n\nIsaiah 55 verse 7 to 9   **\n7\tlet the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the LORD; and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon \n8\tFor my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. \n9\tFor as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts your thoughts.  **\n \nvii. Follow the word of God, celebrate burial ceremony in the spirit of mourning and not feasting. **  **\n \n\nCHAPTER 11   **\nA SAINT THAT WENT TO HEAVEN.   **\n \nAgain I am Sister Linda Paul Rika. I am sharing here a blessed revelation the Lord gave me concerning our Late Sister Zenum Tanko Hassan who passed away on the 13th of January, 2014. Sister Zenum was one of the seven women the International Director, Pastor Paul Rika, selected to be praying for the Ministry, Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. On the 13th of January 2014, Pastor Rika called the seven women to come to Abuja for prayer in preparation for the approaching International Leadership Conference. On her way to Abuja from Lagos, she had an accident that led to her death.   **\n \n11.1 Sister Zenum Made It to Heaven.   ** \nIsaiah 57 verse 1,2   **\n1\tThe righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart;  and merciful men are taken away, none considerate that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come. \n2\tHe shall enter into peace  they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness   ** \nSister Zenum was not known to me clearly; although, she was described to me and I was reminded of the gift she had given me. But still, I did not remember her face again. At first, I was troubled about the accident and her death, but later, I felt peaceful and became calm. I thought I enjoyed that peace because I didn't know her well. During the wake keep on 30th of January, 2014, some brethren testified of her holy Christian lifestyle before her departure.  One of our pastors that preached at the wake-keep said confidently that Sister Zenum was in heaven. When the pastor said that, I heard the voice of the Lord Jesus saying to me, “My daughter I am here. Many are saying in their hearts, “Is it because Zenum joined Holiness Revival Movement that she qualifies to enter heaven? Are they not just trying to promote their ministry? \nMany don't believe when I say in My holy word that without holiness no man shall see Me. Tomorrow I will show you how Zenum made heaven so that you will share it with them during the burial service. This will help those who do not still believe in holiness to believe and practice it.  \nWhen I woke up in the morning and was observing my quiet time, the Lord Jesus said, “My daughter, I am here to show you what I told you yesterday about how Sister Zenum made it to heaven. I will also show you how they were persecuting and calling her all sorts of name in the Church and among some of her relations.  **\nPsalm 15 verse 1 to 5   **\n1\tLord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill? \n2\tHe that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. \n3\tHe that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor \n4\tIn whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. \n5\tHe that putteh not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these shall never be moved.  **\n \n11.2 How Zenum Made It to Heaven.    **\nInstantly, I saw myself at the scene of the accident. I saw the vehicle moving but not at high speed. The enemy attacked this vehicle and the driver could not understand what was happening. He began to struggle with the steering and the vehicle began to somersault. Sister Zenum was thrown out of the car window and her head hit the ground and was broken.  As she landed and blood began to gush out of her, people around began shouting for help to rescue her. Many people rushed to the accident scene, but suddenly, her soul came out of her body. She stood watching her body and discovered that she was two – one standing up and the other lying down.  She was surprised to see herself two. She started asking people around her, “What is going on? What is going on? Why am I two?” But people were not hearing her. She was confused and started running up and down. Then, a man's voice called her name twice, “Zenum! Zenum!” She turned and saw the man standing at the other side of the road and crossed over to meet him. She said, “Thank God you can hear me. What is going on here? Why am I seeing myself two?” The man replied, “I am an angel sent by Jesus to take you to heaven. You have died. Say goodbye to the world.” She exclaimed, “Ah, ah,  so this is true! So, holiness is true! So I made it to heaven?” She was exceedingly happy and was acting as if she was out of her senses. With great joy she kept asking, \n“So I made it to heaven? I made it to heaven. So this thing is true! So holiness is true! So what I believed is true!”   **\nJohn 14 verse 1 to 3   **\n1\tlet not your heart be troubled  ye believe in God, believe also in me  \n2\tin my Father`s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. \n3\tAnd if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that were I am, there ye may be also.   ** \nThen she turned to the man and said “My family members are not aware that I made it to heaven. I don't want them to be sorrowful about my death. How can I tell them and my friends and Church members that they should not cry because I made it to heaven? How can I do that because these people are not hearing me” Then the angel replied, “Don't worry. Jesus has sent His peace to His righteous and holy children that believe in him in holiness and righteousness to them that you are in heaven. Don't bother about what you want to say to them.” When she heard this, she was consoled and happy.   **\n \nJohn 14 verse 27    **\n“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you, let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid “  \n \nShe saw how her body was taken to the hospital. When the husband came to the hospital and saw the body of his wife, he stood and was looking at her with deep sorrow. She started calling on him, “Tanko, Tanko, see me here. I made it. Please, don't be in pain. Holiness is true. Please, hold on to holiness. Draw my children to holiness. Don't leave holiness, follow holiness. Holiness brought me here. I made heaven, tell my children not to cry because I made it to heaven.” She continued talking to her husband so that he could hear her. “Tanko, look at me. I am here. I made it.” Then the angel held her hand and there was a force that took them up through the sky. She started waving to her husband, smiling and happy as they went up. The angel too was smiling, she kept on waving at the world, saying 'I made it” until the cloud received them out of my sight. Jesus showed me how they entered into the cloud and how they went into heaven. I saw her in the midst of angels, wearing white garment and praising God.  Her garment was bright, shining and glowing as the light. The saints and the angels were waving and worshiping God. She was so happy, worshipping God among them.   **\nThen the Lord closed the vision from my eyes.    **\nRevelation 7 verse 13 to 17  **\n“And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, what are these which are arrayed in white robes? And whence came they? \nAnd I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, these are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them whit in the blood of the Lamb \nTherefore, are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them \nThey shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. \nFor the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters  and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.”  ** \n \nRevelation 21 verse 4 to 7  **\n4\tAnd God shall wipe away all tears from their eye;  And there shall be no more death, neither, sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain  for the former things are passed away  \n5\tAnd he that sat upon the throne said, behold I make all things new. And he said unto me, write these words are true and faithful. \n6\tAnd he said unto me, it is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. \n7\tHe that overcometh shall inherit all things; And I will be his God, and he shall be my son.  **\n \n11.3 Why Zenum Made It To Heaven.  ** \nThen I started hearing an audible voice saying to me,  \n“My daughter, have you seen how Zenum made it to heaven? Now, I want to tell you why Zenum made it to heaven so that you can go and tell those who do not believe in my holiness and righteousness. \nZenum was a Christian for many years and was zealous in My vineyard. She believed and knew Me but she was not in My holy way. That is why I sent My servant, Pastor Apollos to Lagos to teach her My holy way and to let her know that without holiness no man can see Me. This was because I knew her time was short on earth. She harkened to My voice, believed and obeyed My words, and transformed herself to My holy standard, both inwardly and outwardly. She did all her restitutions and took away all the properties of Jezebel on her; rings, earing, necklace, chains, bracelet, perming, attachment, weavon,  wool trousers etc. She was zealous in My vineyard in righteousness and holiness. This made her to find favour in My sight and for the gate of heaven opened for her to enter in. She pleased Me her Creator in her work in this one year.   **\nSecond Corinthians 7 verse 1    **\n“Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”  **  \n \nRomans 12 verse 1,2     **\n“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service  \nAnd be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.” \n \nNow, go and tell them in the burial service because many of those that persecuted her in the Church and in the house, and some of her friends and family members are there for the burial. Tell them it is not how long you have worked in My vineyard that will make someone enter heaven. What will grant them access to heaven is righteousness and holiness. Tell all that are crying for Zenum to cry for themselves. Tell all those calling her names and laughing at her because she decided to remove all satanic properties from her body that those that are still doubting and have not believed My message will not enter My Kingdom. Nothing that defiles will enter there. Tell them to hold on to holiness inward and outward.     **\nThen the Lord closed the vision.  ** \n \nRevelation 3 verse 7 to 13  **\n“And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; these things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man opneth; \nI know thy works, behold I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it  for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name  \nBehold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not but do lie, behold I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. \nBecause thou has kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shalt come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth \nBehold, I come quickly, hold thou fast which thou hast that no man take your crown. Him that overcometh, will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God, and I will write upon him my new name.  He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith, unto the churches.”  **\n \n11.4 Burial Ceremonial of Sister Zenum Tanko Hassan.   **\nNumber 23 verse 10   **\n“who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the forth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his! “\n \nThe burial ceremony of sister Zenum held in Takum, Taraba State, Nigeria. I and my wife sister Linda were personally in the ceremony. The revelation the Lord gave her was in the hotel where we lodged. She knelt beside the bed that morning in prayer, while I was preparing the sermon to preach at the burial. The Lord gave her the vision on her knees that Saturday morning.  **\n Numbers 24 verse 4 ,5.    **\n4\tHe hath said, which heard the word of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open  \n5\tHow goodly are thy tents, O Jacob and thy tabernacles, O Israel!    **\nThe burial ceremony of saintly Zenum, the wife of our beloved brother Tanko Hassan and mother of three children, was scripturally simple as described earlier in this book.  **\n1.\tMourners assembled , \n2.\tWorship songs were raised, \n3.\tThe corpse was placed before all to see,  \n4.\tHymns were sung,  \n5.\tPeople gave testimonies on the deceased,  \n6.\tHer biography was read, \n7.\tI preached the sermon, \n8.\tSis Linda gave the revelation of the Lord on Zenum, \n9.\tPrayers were offered,  \n10.\tSnap shots were taken,  \n11.\tThe body was covered for internment.   **\n \nAlthough we knew that Zenum made it to heaven, there was mourning on her death and burial according to human nature and scriptural pattern.    **\n \n1.\tThere was mourning over Jacob`s death. Genesis. 50 verse 10, \n2.\tThere was mourning over the death of Moses. Deuteronomy 34 verse 8, \n3.\tThere was mourning over the death of Lazarus John 11 verse 32 to 35.  **\n \nMourning with Caution.   **\nFirst Thessalonians 4 verse 13 to14  **\n13\tBut I would not have you to be ignorant brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope \n14\tFor if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.  **\n \nYou noticed in the revelation account of Zenum that she sent comfort to her loved ones encouraging them not to cry because she had made it to heaven, although her words were not heard, being now removed from the physical realm. The Lord want fellow believers to sorrow and mourn with peace because the late brother or sister has gone to be with the Lord and if we remain in Christ righteousness and holiness to the end, we shall meet them again and be in everlasting fellowship. It is not seen in scripture and in contemporary times that even the burial ceremony of a saint was celebrated in a festive way with eating, drinking, laughing, singing, dancing in jubilation. Be scriptural, be holy.  **\n \nHOLINESS REVIVAL MINISTRY WORLDWIDE \nALSO KNOWN AS HOLINESS REVIVAL MOVEMENT WORLDWIDE (HOREMOW)   \n \n\n",

      "body": "SERVING GOD IN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HOLINESS   **\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE  **\nChurch and holiness  **\n\nLuke 1 verse 74 to 75    **\n“That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him, without fear, In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.”   **\nThis is the plan and desire of God for mankind. For this is the reason why Jesus came into this world. Jesus made it clear that God is looking for worshipers and servants that will serve Him; in righteousness and holiness all the days of their life.   **\nJohn 4 verse 22 to 24   **\n“Ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship  for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh; and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.”   **\nThe Father is seeking such people that will worship him. Which people? They are those that will worship him in spirit and truth. Another portion of the Scripture says; those that will worship him in righteousness and Holiness. Let it be known that righteousness and holiness are virtually disappearing from the earth and the church. And the LORD wants to recover and to enroll people that will serve him in righteousness and holiness. The condition of the church today is that people worship what they do not know. They make so much noise, yet they do not know what they are doing. They sing and clap; to whom are they singing and clapping? The Scriptures they read but do not understand. It is so, because the people have not understood righteousness and holiness. \nThe pastors have not understood it and are not working in righteousness and holiness. They do not preach it therefore the members are of the church are not aware of righteousness and holiness. It is fast disappearing. it is quite difficult for one to see a large congregation or assemble talking about righteousness and holiness.  They only talk about entertainment and other things. Great crusades too are not centered on righteousness and holiness. Indeed, they do not talk about it but on other matters. Righteousness and holiness have disappeared and no more in the heart of people. **\nThe LORD is calling on people, reviving and bringing them back to the point; where they will serve the LORD in righteousness and holiness. According to the vision of God, Righteousness is possible. If it was not possible, the LORD would not have asked us to do it. God is not a task master, because holiness is possible, otherwise, the LORD would not tell us that we must be holy. **\nThese things are possible and require the will to make it work. God wants people that will be willing, even as He says that if you are willing, you shall eat the good fruit of the land. Therefore, if you will be willing, you shall live this life of righteousness. If you are also ready and prepared, you will enter into holiness, as you are going to see it today. You will see that as you read this book, pray and believe, you shall be purified and walk in righteousness. The power of God shall be felt in your life. The presence of God shall be in your life and righteousness shall spring up. Holiness shall come down upon your life, amen. Your heart and thought shall be purified; all the sins that have been overcoming you; you shall overcome them perfectly. This is what God is looking for. Much more, this conference is for Christian workers and ministers. **\nGod is looking for workers and ministers that will serve him in righteousness and holiness but there are ministers who are saying that it is not possible to be righteous. They say that they are just trying their best. It is not possible to be holy, but just trying to be holy and thus have communicated their members. They have communicated this to the workers under them so they are doing this work without the vision of righteousness or the vision of holiness. **\nThe Bible says that where there is no vision, the people perish. However, where there is no vision of holiness you cannot attain it. Also, where there is no vision of righteousness you cannot possess it. We are raising the vision of holiness and righteousness which you shall see and possess. What are we then saying, that as a preacher, you will preach and be a righteous and holy man? **\nAs a teacher, are you not going to teach others, yet you are polluted. You tell lies because you are a liar teaching other not to commit immorality while you are committing same. Talking about Evangelists, as you are going about from place to place preaching this Gospel, God demands that you preach this gospel in righteousness and holiness that your life preaches along with your lips. Be then an example of the believers and to those people you are preaching to. **\nWhat do we say therefore to the prophets that are always prophesying? Do not be a sinner giving false prophesies thus, telling lies in the name of the LORD. Rather, you will prophesy and be a righteous person. You will prophesy in righteousness and it must be God that will give you the word because, you cannot speak the word by your own accord. God must give you the direction so that you prophesy the truth. What the LORD has not told you, you will not say. You will only say it faithfully what Jesus has told you. Children teachers, as you are doing the work of handling children, you are not to play or joke with them. You are to preach righteousness and the children must see it in your life. That is the expectation of God. **\nUshers, as you go about doing this work, ensure your eyes are neither receiving nor collecting evil from the way a person sits or lies down. Ensure you are not entertaining yourself with evil or collecting offerings as an usher you are busy also putting the money into your pocket. That is what God is against and is not how to serve God. We must serve God in righteousness. **\nMaybe you are asked to buy something for the church, your fellow group or you are to also keep money for your fellowship group that you must do in righteousness. Anything you have to do concerning the work of God, concerning the name of the LORD, you should do in righteousness that your hands be clean and that you serve God with a clean heart. **\nPastors as you take care of your church members, all the young girls, widows, married women, do not contaminate yourself with them. You do not lust after them. As women in the church busy walking around the pastors, do not be lusting after them. You plan and strategize on how to corrupt the leaders. This is not how to serve the living God. **\nThe righteousness of God is lost. The holiness of members and preachers of the gospel is also lost. This is why the LORD is calling us back to it because \nServing God in Righteousness and Holiness without righteousness, our service will not prosper and we will not prosper in anything. \nAre you working as electrician, in electronic media or whatever you are doing, you should do them with joy and happiness. You are to look for more opportunities to do the work so as to serve him in righteousness and holiness, all the days of our lives.    **\nAs Ministers and Christian workers, they are to come together and relate in the service of God doing· one thing or the other. God expects that we do it in righteousness and holiness without grudges and bitterness in our heart. Pride in our lives, division in our heart and murmuring are the things God does not want. The God of righteousness, Creator of our lives and the LORD of the Church does not want them. His aim is that He will save us to serve Him in righteousness and holiness all the days of our lives. When you fail to live in righteousness everyday whether it is morning or night, you become troubled. \nGod planted the sun in the sky and it has been shining every day without ceasing. It shines every day. Whatever the LORD does is forever. His aim is to enable you accept righteousness and holiness all the days of your life. And the LORD shall restore righteousness and holiness to you and shall establish you in the holy work. You will work with him forever and ever in Jesus name. Amen. \nThe Bible says you should depart; come out from their midst and be clean you that bear the vessel of the LORD. \nHow can God say He will work out a new revival in the world through you when you are not clean nor obtained His righteousness. \nHow can God enroll you as one of the ministers of the end time when your life is in a mess? You are not qualified and therefore need help. People around you are shouting it over you that you are not qualified, then, how can God make you the minister of the end time? How can He? It is for this reason that He is saying no. It cannot be. You must make yourself clean and righteous and it is then you will join the army of this end time.    **\nThe Bible says that the foundation of God stands sure having this seal; the LORD knows them that are His, and let him that names the name of Christ, depart from iniquity. This is because in a great house, there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wools and he that purges himself from this shall be used as a vessel unto honour, purified by the master and suitable for the master's use. Our prayer is that the God of holiness, righteousness, purification, sanctification, transformation, and perfection shall do the special work today so that people shall be purified, sanctified, perfected and serve this our God, in righteousness and holiness every day of our lives. Righteousness and Holiness before men. \nGod is speaking earnestly to your heart; therefore, take this matter serious. Unconsciously, you have been serving God, without direction or vision, and have not understood the meaning of Christ's death. You do not understand the meaning of the Scriptures and the pure word of God. It is possible that you have a poor Christian background, where you were taught that there is no righteousness and nobody can be holy or perfect and you accepted. Your heart is yet to come to full grip of the message, hence the emphasis. \nPerhaps, you read the Scripture without understanding but now, we are opening your eyes. Let your eyes open to see the things that righteousness is expected of you among men. Thus, let us consider the difference between these two words  Holiness and Righteousness    **\n \nSecond Corinthians 5 verse 21  **\n “For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\"    **\nRighteousness has two meanings  The first meaning is acceptance. The person receives from God because he is joined to Jesus or united with Jesus. It is an acceptance that a person receives from God because, he believes in Jesus. He has accepted Jesus, even as God gives that person righteousness. He is made righteous. It is like a man accepting you to be his son, treats you favourably because you are a friend of his son or daughter. Because you love his daughter and associates with him, he then decides to love you, accept and therefore treats you favourably as he treats his son that is righteousness. \nAs you are united with Jesus and have accepted Him; you have believed in Jesus, God has declared your righteousness. Give a clap offering and rejoice. You are acceptable in Him. Now you have favour and righteousness in God through Christ.    **\n \n \n \nCHAPTER TWO     **\nWhat is Holiness?  **\nHoliness is the life of the righteous man which he lives without committing sin. Again, it is like the man that made you, accepted you because of his son or daughter. Holiness is obeying the instructions and the rules of the man without failing. That is holiness. You are made righteous, and then you are also to be Holy, to please that man. To get the best of that man, you must obey his instructions and leadings in order to see righteousness and Holiness and be different. \nRighteousness is your acceptance while Holiness is your lifestyle. However, some see righteousness and holiness as meaning the same thing. If you are righteous, behaving well and doing what his son asks you to do following the example of his son, that is Holiness in its self. Therefore, in this regard, righteousness and holiness go together. Then what does it mean? \nSimply that you serve God in righteousness and holiness all the days of your life. It also means that in your service to God, there is no time for you to disengage from Jesus. Every moment and every day of your life, you are still in connection with Jesus. There will be no time or day to disengage from Jesus. That again is serving God in righteousness all the days of your life. Then, serving God in Holiness all the days of your life means your service to God. Make sure you are obedient to all the word of God and do not break his commandment. There will be no rest but to keep His word daily. \nYou are to obey His word and maintain His standard every day. Then, you will be serving God in Holiness all the days of your life. Is this possible? Yes.    **\nFirst Thessalonians 2 verse 10    **\n “Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holy, and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe.”    **\nLet it be clear to all Christians, Pastors and Leaders that holiness is possible yet you have disappointed God because of lies. As a Christian leader, you tell lies, cheat and have terrible anger in your life. It is a disappointment. You are a Christian leader but wicked and an evil man; sin and evil have brought about your falling from His standard. Christian leaders of the truth should not be evil but serving God in righteousness and in Holiness. \nAs Paul says not only I, but as ministers in Holiness Revival Movement do not commit sin. If you commit sin as a State Coordinator, you are a sinner. Do not therefore think that others will be like you. No. If you commit sin as a wife of a pastor or a Coordinator do not think other women are like you. There are people that are serving God and His record shows it. The Lord knows that you are the vessel of God in this movement and He will put you into effective usage with promises of great reward because of your commitment to holiness and righteousness. \nYes, this scripture is fulfilled in your life. I say holiness and righteousness before men that is what he said. Paul said that you are witnesses because I have lived my life before you. Therefore, when people complain about you, be sure to find out if they are true or not. It may be that somebody told the pastor that he was lying, and you reacted saying that you are living by the grace of God. Is the grace of God for lying? No. Shall we continue to lie that the grace of God will be there? People should not complain against you. \nThe Bible says that if you are choosing a Bishop, he should be somebody that will not bring a reproach. If does not have an evil report of the gentiles and of sinners, he should then be completely righteous. The Church should therefore not complain against you. You should be righteous and holy but if there will be any complaint, let it not be sustained as they will not be truth in it. \nLet no woman rise up to say that this pastor wanted to or committed immorality with me. \nWhen this happens, then they will ask people not to take her seriously and not border about it. Not to worry because we will be bordered. Whatever that made her to open up saying those things about you must be taken seriously. Indeed, we will border and proper investigations will be done. \nListen, God is tired of false preachers and He is raising a new team of preachers; do not bring the old thing into this place. The Bible says you cannot pour a new wine into an old wine skin because it will have a problem. Will you bring this wonderful movement and build it on old prophet? No. You must be righteous and holy in your life. \nAnd women, be righteous and perfect. Moreover, as a wife you must not be double tongued. Check and control your mouth. Do not be a busy body. That is the Scriptures. God is looking for righteousness even as we are. He wants righteous and holy people that will serve him every day, then there will be peace and joy in the heart of God. \nThe world has disappointed Him because there are great people that have no life in them.   **\nActs 23 verse 1    **\n“And Paul earnestly beholding the council, said, men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.”   **\nWhat is being discussed is conscience not only before God but, before men because there is need to have a good report about you.    **\n Second Kings 4 verse 8 to 9 says    **\n “And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shumen, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it passed by; he turned in thither to eat bread. Verse 9. And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.”    **\nCan you see that the report is of men? Elisha was not there and the woman observed Elisha not only for one day. The Bible says that you shall know them by their fruits but a tree does not bear fruits every day. The woman had sufficient time to examine the life of Elisha yet she drew him closer. If he was the lusting type and greedy looking for money, the woman would have known it. She was a great woman in that city. \nAfter observing Elisha for a reasonable period of time, she told her husband that the man was a holy man of God. This is the type of report expected from you and people to give this type of report over you. People that have been watching you should tell us who you are. \nEven those under your ministry should tell us more about you. Do not allow people say pastor; we do not understand you anymore and do not discuss that type of thing here. Let the people that are working with you very closely tell us who you are and to give this report that the man or the woman is holy. \nThe report is expected to come from the people, after they had examined Jesus even in pain. The cross with all the pain, the ill treatment after some hours of examining Jesus; all the mockery of people over him, his reaction to the laughter by the thief on the cross and His compassion over the cross. After all examination, the centurion said, surely this man is innocent; He is the son of God. \nAfter the people's accusation, oppression, maybe you are passing through some difficulties. \nHave they challenged you, or told lies against you after all others are watching your reactions. They are watching your attitude that they may provoke you to anger, let them come up, to say that this woman is holy. We need that testimony from people and not only from you but from the mouth of two or three witnesses every matter is established. \nLet it be told that after they have watched you, want your husband even if he is the bulling type or has bullied, abused or spat on you and did everything after some days, weeks and may be even months, He should explain who you are. The report will state whether you are righteous because, those things are to prove you. The light shines brightest when it gets darker, when things are tough, we want to see how you react. \nWhat will people say about your reaction and attitude? We want your wife to give us report about who you are. Who actually is the husband? Is your husband righteous? Does your husband know Jesus? \nThe position given to your husband, is it wrongly given? This claim of ministry that your husband is saying he is going to start; does he qualify by your assessment? This is what we are looking for in righteousness and holiness before men. People gave us report about you.   **\nFirst Peter 2 verse 12   **\n“Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles,  that whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.”    **\nThat is what we desire, that they speak evil about you, but later change and say this man is a righteous man. Now, that your wife is accusing you of righteousness and you are bold, tightening your face to overcome her, do you know that your wife is a messenger of God? It is to assess you while you are still alive, so that you do not waste your energy and strength. Is she rather trying to do evil against you? No. You know that the woman is right and your conscience will confirm that. If she is right, then settle down and solve the matter because, the Bible says that obedience is better than sacrifice. Humble yourself before her and come back to the standard of Christianity as required of God. \nAnd your Christianity is because your husband has used all his powers on you and failed that you are going not because of righteousness but because he is persecuting you. No, they are true matters that are unsettled and do not even have the time to settle, but are busy saying that I am a minister. Of course, that is not the type of minister we are looking for. This is not the type of minister that should join this Movement. No. \nGet that matter settled. Why are you more interested in preaching and becoming the General \nOverseer than going to Heaven? Your interest lies more in holding position than going to Heaven and that is all the noise about you. Brother, purify yourself, you that is double minded get yourself cleaned up, attain the standard that people can now say, yes, he is qualified to be our leader. He is not a stumbling block, but an epitome of righteousness and holiness before men. \nRighteousness and holiness before God Some of us are very lucky and have favor before men. We can laugh so well, be gentle before them, kind and people say we are wonderful, great and there is no Christian is like us. We are taking you from men to God whom you cannot deceive or mock but who is perfect, light; let that light shine on you. \nLet that light expose your heart to God whose eyes see more than the eyes of the eagle. He sees into darkness, privacy, and into the thought of the imagination of our hearts. When Nebuchadnezzar was speaking, who was there to hear him? God heard him from heaven. \nThe thought of his heart went up to Heaven and God saw it and reacted. God is not like man nor is He like the son of man. Let us take you to him. \nWe are talking about righteousness and holiness before God.    **\nLuke 1 verse 74 to 75    **\n \"That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear. In Holiness and Righteousness before him, all the days of our life.\"    **\nTherefore, the holiness we are talking about is before him.   **\nLook at this Story    **\nOne of the days, we were in my house, may be the day they bombed “Nyanya”(a state in Nigria), my driver said he did not know or understand the patience of God; to him, He should have destroyed those people. I laughed, because when l looked at him, I wondered what it was all about thinking on how best to handle him. Not that I laughed too much, but just smiled in my heart. About two weeks or thereafter, we were in “Gombe”(a place in Nigeria) for a programme; Angel Gabriel visited my wife and among other revelations, he said your husband did a thing that God was very unhappy with. What happened? When the driver was speaking, he saw it as a foolish talk. God has confidence in him, because His eyes are on him; how then could he laugh at such a matter. I got the shock of my life. You can see the judgment of God and the righteousness He is talking about. I do not want to offend him in one point as I have. Then the angel said Well, God is not like a man in His judgment. God saw his heart that he was planning to talk with him later, that made God to forgive him. Therefore, Daddy Rika has been forgiven. Amen. \nOn the side of God, how could I have appeared before Heaven and know that i have sinned? \nThat is what it means, on the side of God but, it is possible to live holy all the days of your life. That is what God is telling us and revealing these things.    **\n First Thessalonians 2 verse 10      **\n“Ye are witnesses and God also, how holy and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe ”    **\nNot only are you witnesses but God also. Brother and sister let us bring the matter to a conclusion. Let us take our holiness to the level of God's approval, and say you are righteous, and holy. He approved Daniel, Job, Noah, Enoch and their righteousness. He declared so; let God declare you righteous and holy. Allow God to say have you considered my servant Job. Despite problem, persecution and attack yet, He keeps his integrity. Let God say so of you, it is possible to live this life.    **\nActs 24 verse 16     **\n“And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and towards men.”    **\nTake these things as a duty and do not play when people are accusing you. Do not laugh when people or family members are accusing you. If it is persecution, check that very well, and let God and those around you approve that. Let God bear witness in your heart that this is persecution. Otherwise; do not take the accusation lightly because you may be playing with your life. Do you not know that this work must be done without blemish or that Jesus Christ died for the church; that He might get it to himself without spot or wrinkle and any such thing? \nThere shall be no blemish that is the standard. Whatever is blemish shall never enter Heaven nor whatsoever that is defiled. If you are busy thinking that you can go to Heaven with your defilement, you will never be there. Perfect, be ye perfect, even as your father who is in Heaven is perfect. Take the Christian life as a business. Paul says herein do l exercise myself to make it a practice, a plan and a determination. Make it a purpose of heart and a duty to live without blemish. \nMake It a plan that when l wake up daily, I will not sin. If I am going to confront somebody and know the report to give and afraid of how it will be to tell lies, then do please come out from there. Take the matter to God for settlement now, and get all the wisdom needed before you meet that person as planned, but not to sin. Plan it in such a way that, you will not sin. \nJohn planned it but he had a terrible wife. He exercised himself, in the presence of his terrible wife that he will never sin. The wife grabbed him on his hair and dragged him along. He could have pushed her down but will do nothing that resembles sin because he preaches holiness and as such will be holy. It was a trial for the holiness doctrine to show human being if this Holiness is true, to stand on it and never fail. That is how you should take it in life, stand before God with a pure conscience.     **\nSecond Corinthians 1 verse 12    **\n “For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.”     **\nThe testimony of our conscience is that we are not doing these things for any personal gain. \nMoney is not part of what we are doing, and there is no other gain. What are we looking for? What do we want? It is the testimony of our conscience that have we calculatedly brought out some things to say to you for any reason. No, in simplicity and godly sincerity, we are doing our best as we know how. From our best preaching to all sincerity. We have our conversation in the world among sinners, very careful. \nAs we entered buses or join the taxi; go to the market, on the street or where ever we are in the world, be very careful in our behavior because, we are under camera. Divine camera is on us, and we do not want God to find us with faults. \nThank God, He is faithful and will tell you if He finds fault on you because, He is not looking for how to destroy you. His aim is to save you because this is not yet the time of destruction. This is the time of salvation. You may have sinned but do not border, He will tell you and not hide it from you. \nTherefore, that is what Paul is saying. We had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to your word. We have preached to you and what sin have you seen in our lives? \nWhat evil have you seen? Told lies, cheated, involved in immorality and looking for money? What you have seen is how we live both in private, public, in the side of men and of God.    **\nSecond Corinthians 2 verse 17   **\n “For we are not as many which corrupt the word of God;  but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.”    **\nYou are not here for prophecy but if there is any or revelation it shall come and if He does not give, we shall not force one. We will not tell lies. It is the testimony of our conscience, and we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God for personal gain and interest. We are not of those people but, we preach sincerity as people and preachers ordained to lead people to Heaven. \nThe Lord is always telling us that this movement is His movement and not for a man. \nIt is HOLINESS REVIVAL MOVEMENT and the LORD is defending it today in another way which is  Who is Holiness? God is reviving people and he is moving worldwide. That is God's name and his work. God is Holiness; He is the one reviving the people and doing it worldwide. Holiness Revival Movement is not an individual or personal work. \nTherefore, why are you corrupting this work? He gives us the message to preach and inside knowledge. Until we went outside, we saw truly that the eye of God is in this movement. You will see people we are the one pasturing in the world. Holiness Revival Movement is the one sustaining them. Everywhere through this internet, they are connected. \nSomeone in Comoro Island, the Caribbean and around Jamaica say that Pastor Rika is our pastor. They sit by their own computers, the internet watching, listening and getting changed, getting purified, sanctified, passing through persecution and moving forward. \nTherefore, God is reviving the world and moving on, so that this word you are caring is not a contaminated word. That is why if anybody say he has seen revelation which is not what we are running after, but the word of God. The revelation must agree with the word of God, and He has granted understanding.    **\nWe are not children; we know the mind of God. This is a diligent work we are doing; we should not just be running after revelation. Revelation must be compared to Scriptures to know whether it be of God, if then, we receive it for an edification. God sent it to us and we are not divided. **\n(1)\tBelieve this, what happened when somebody say this or that. \n(2)\tBelieve this one, what did he say? This or that causing confusion? Can you trace it in the Bible? Some people may say that if a man is making love with his wife they should not be in this position. Jesus says if they are in this position it is Evil and against God. Maybe you have been hearing this. Ours is what did the Bible says? Does the Bible say those things? If a woman is like that it shows that she is not subject to her husband. Is that the subject the Bible is talking about or in character or behaviour and life style? I am speaking in proverb; let him that have ear to hear, hear what l am saying.    **\nRighteousness and Holiness Before God. You must be righteous and maintain righteousness in your conscience. Whatever you preach, check if you are preaching well. Check the stories you tell. Crosscheck the land and the building you are buying to ensure that you are not in a struggle with another person. Two Churches groups or denominations are negotiating to buy land and one quickly runs to pay, thereby collecting the land at the detriment of the other while preaching Jesus. And you say you are Holy to preach this same Jesus. Is Jesus divided? No. \nSince those people are also children of God and have come before God, why do you not give up? It shows that the church is not for Him but for you and not for Jesus. \nOtherwise if Jesus had sent a people there, you would not struggle to overcome Jesus among those people. Check the work you are doing, the testimony you are giving to collect money, those methods and the prophecies you are using. Thus says the Lord, or that the Lord revealed to me that you are causing confusion, getting closer to man of God, when you are not a man of God but just getting a covering. \nPeople should know that you are a great man because; you have identified with great people. Corrupt mind, God knows you; remove those things from your life and let us serve God in righteousness and holiness.    ** \n \n \nCHAPTER THREE   **\n Holiness and Righteousness in Daily Life and Service   **\nHoliness and righteousness in daily living can be achieved by sound devotional life and meditation on God's word and commitment to personal prayer. John 15 verse 3 “Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.” \nNow, I have spoken some words to you and those words have cleansed you. With what shall a young man cleanse his way but by taking it according to thy word. Thy word have I hidden in my heart that l may not sin against thee. Without reading this word, paying attention to the Bible, meditation of the word, holiness is impossible. You are not reading the Bible; nor studying the Bible, but live like that, sin will take over. Dust will cover your house, room and everywhere with pieces of paper here and there. Why? You are not sweeping that room. You are not constantly sweeping that room. \nNow you are clean by hearing and studying this word, reading the books of inspired Christian literature, getting them, eating them that they work out cleanliness for your life. The Bible says that you might be sanctified and cleansed by the washing of water by the word. Sanctify them through because thy word is true. And if you have nothing to do with this word, how will you know your errors? The Bible says be you doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourself. He that is the hearer of the word and not a doer, the same is like a man that is himself in a mirror. This means that the reading of the word makes you see yourself as you actually are. \nThe things that are in your life, the weaknesses, the way you went wrong, the imagination of your thought that are wrong, you will see the temptation in a far distant.    **\n  \nThrough the study of the word then, you will be able to go to God and get it off. You will be able to make up your mind and say no it will not happen to me. Ok, is that what Satan plans against me; no, it will not work. That is how you can help your soul. \nBut then you are not studying Scriptures; you are not reading the Bible. Preachers that are not reading Scriptures but only read to look for a message; cannot stand. You are not strong, or righteous; lies are on your lips, therefore why you not come to this Scripture to read it. Even when an assignment is given that you read the New Testament and finish it, you do not read your Bible. \nPrayer  \nThe Bible says that you should ask the father anything in my name and He will give you. Ask and receive that your joy will be full. Ask and it shall be given thee, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto thee. He that asks receives, that seeks finds and to him that knocks it shall be opened which one of you; if his son asks him for bread will give him a stone? If he asks for fish, will give him a serpent? If you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more your father in heaven who gives good gifts to those who ask him. \nI know the thought | think towards you, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you the expected end, then ye shall call upon me who ye shall go and pray unto me and I will harkens unto you, ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart and I shall be found of you says the LORD and I will turn you away from your captivity. \nPray and bring every sin before God. Those that l do not see, teach me if l have done iniquity and I will do no more. Take it to God in prayer; He will take way every sin, from your life. He says he will do it. Do you take time to pray? Have you taken time to pray over that situation? Over that lust that is disturbing your heart? Lust in your heart, beating your heart, dragging your life; have you taken time to pray? Knock at the door violently and ask God to deliver you. \nHave mercy upon me, oh God, wash me, purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean. Oh I have told lies again, oh Lord deliver me and l will do the restitution over that lie now. Have you taken time to pray to get yourself purified? Also, have you taken time to pray over her and him because this person is always watching out for my sins, therefore temper with his or her life? Have you taken that person to God in prayer? \nPrayer will keep you, purify you, cleanse your life and strengthen you. Call upon me and l will hearken unto you, and show you great and mighty things which you do not know. Call upon me in the days of trouble and I will deliver you and my name shall be glorified. When there is a pleasure to commit sin call on God, He will deliver you and you will be so grateful and happy glorifying His name. Therefore, improve and increase your devotional life, personal prayer and commitment. \nYou who are leaders, when you send members of your church praying and you do not join them but take the pleasure sleeping, you are dealing with yourself. Whatever a man sows, that he shall reap. All the tension that are in your body become stiff and you cannot exercise your body but rather is rejecting prayer. But I feel like praying for more than one month now. \nYou are doing nothing about it. When will you start feeling like praying? Bring yourself together and join those people that are prayer. If you do not even know what to pray, then shout the name of Jesus. The power of God will come to lose you, and the spirit of prayer will take over your life. You are doing so to keep your life going.    **\nPersonal discipline    **\nIf you want to be a holy man; in the sight of God, then personal discipline is required.        **            \nFirst Corinthians 9 verse 24 to 27   **\n“know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize. So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. I therefore so run, not as uncertainly, so fight l, not as one that beateth the air.”    **\nBut l keep under my body, and bring it unto subjection  lest that by any means when l have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.” \nI suppose the reason is that the possibility that you will go to hell is very high, are you not aware of that. That is why you are sitting down doing nothing. You are not struggling but take more time to sleep, looking for more time to while away watching television. Also you spend more time on the internet, doing another thing in the market. You prefer sitting down among friends and the Bible is left unattended to. \nThere is no prayer life as there is no time for it but spent all your time travelling, because you do not know that the possibility of your going to hell is very high. Paul knew it so he did something practical with his body by bringing it under control. Sometimes, this Christian preaching does not preach too much that Jesus become lost. You can even remember him again even if all you remember is preaching do not get to that point. \nWhat shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and loose his own soul? Your soul is vital. Come when you were going did you not see some white hair that was here and there in your life? When you were going up and down did you not notice some noise troubling your conscience? \nIs that not enough for you to create time and clear this thing off and settle with your life? Are you not receiving the signal? Paul said he did something to himself to ensure this heaven is not missed. Go and do something to your life. Do something to yourself. Take measure that this heaven you will not miss. \nWhoever is provoking you fortify yourself now and say I will never mind provocation anymore because, I do not want to miss Heaven? Discipline and study to make yourself approved before God, a work man that needed not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of God. \nLet it not be once mentioned that as a leader, you commit immorality. But fornication and covetousness let it not be once mentioned amongst you. Do not try it so that you do not fail. In that place you are working, let them not find you with fault. That was how Daniel lived his life even before Jesus came into this world with fullness of grace. Ensure that there is no fault in your office because that is what God wants from you. That is the righteousness he brought to this life and it is the righteousness he has financed by the cross. Giving all diligence add to your faith, patience to your life and work hard. Make yourself patient, add knowledge, read books, get CDS and add to your faith. \nSelf-control  Temperance is needed here. You must have self- control in every manner, be it sleep, cloth, food, wrath, everything. Be self-controlled and do not go to excess so that it will not affect your life. \nBrotherly love  Learn to love your brother, to smile and to talk cheerfully with people. Try it, learn it, and do not say it is your nature. Jesus came to change nature in this life. By nature we are not children of God nor righteous. Therefore, come to the light of Christ, practice it and you will soon catch up with it. Practice kindness, learn to give, it may be painful in your heart but release your hands. Do this in your Christian life; this is what God wants in your life. Divine discipline is required to make you holy.    **\nHebrews 12 verse 5 to 11   **\n“And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, not faint when thou art rebuked of him. For whom the Lord loveth \nhe chasteneth, and scourgeth every sin whom he receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, where of all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.”   **\nFurthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence  shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and lives? For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of the holiness. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.” \nDivine chastisement, God has a way of dealing with you and they are for your holiness, purity and he has a way, therefore do not reject it. Do not murmur or fight against it. Why did he choose to take the children of Israel through the wilderness? Why not a straight cut, where there was no danger, wild beast or serpent? He wanted to prove them. Why did God allow hunger and taste to come upon them? \nHe wanted to prove them. Why did God allow them to come before the great red sea? He wanted to demonstrate His power but, and to prove their faith. Why did God allow even their enemies to advance or allow things that are questionable in your life? Things that are bringing pain, shame, disappointment, making you naked and things that are making you go this or that way? People are even laughing at you. Why? It is for your holiness. If you can gear up, strengthening again and stand despite your ability to attain holiness. If you will not be moved by those things but hold yourself, you will hold to holiness.    **\nThe fellowship of brethren -    **\nIt is to purify and preserve believers in God's holiness. At the fellowship of the brethren we come together, cheer one another, which is what God wants. Do not despise the assembling of believers nor forsake it as the manner of some is. But come together and exhort one another as we see the day approaching. It is good for you to come here. Indeed, it is very good, and so make up your mind that you will be coming. We are doing this together as one preaches, you listen and as we are hearing one another, it becomes a privilege. \nAs I conclude the preaching, I then sit down while another person comes up and as he is preaching, we listen and pray together. You join the people to pray which is very vital for your life. Therefore, do not forsake the assembling together it will keep you. If you belong to this group, we will always be asking about you, how you are faring or coping with life. Oh, we did not see you at the fellowship, what happened? You will know that you have friends, fathers, spiritual mothers, brother and sisters and these will care for your life. The enemy will not carry you away as they will be praying for you. Now finally the Bible said that He will deliver you from our enemies and we will serve him without fear. If you want to be a holy man, you must deal with fear, as long as you are afraid of the office, holiness will be difficult for you. \nBecause you will stumble by that. You will exalt it above God. As long as you are so full of fear of the Government, holiness will be impossible.  I am talking about slavery and fear for which holiness will be impossible. As long as you are afraid of the church and its authority, holiness will be impossible because he that fears is not made perfect in love, and God is love. \nHe that feared is not of faith so, holiness will be impossible.    **\nAs long as you are subject to the fear of man, holiness cannot be lived, because that man will not have the power. As long as you are afraid of your wife, holiness is not possible as you will always tell lies to please her. You will compromise as long as you are afraid of your husband, of your marriage and holiness will not be possible.   **\n.This is because you will exalt marriage above God. All the demands of God you will not be able to meet because of marriage. \nYour fear is that it will affect your marriage therefore you cannot be holy. As long as you are afraid of your friends, and your relations, holiness will not be possible. You must deal with fear and see everything as it does not exist and that only God exists then, you can obey his voice. When He speaks, there is no competitive voice, when He commands, there is no competitive authority. It is then you can live a holy life. You are going to seek His face for holiness and will say, God I want to serve you in holiness. Righteousness and holiness I want to begin.  God Bless You! \n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "SUCCESS AND ACHIEVEMENT THROUGH PRAYER, COUNSEL AND WISDOM.  **\n\n\nCHAPTER ONE   **\n\nGOD IS MOVING YOU FORWARD   **\n \nExodus 14 verse15   **\n“And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:”  **\nMany people are in a stand-still position and that is not the mind of God for them. They are retarded, stunted and stagnated. They are not moving forward or making progress. That is not the mind of God for them. Many blame their state on the devil. If it is the devil, then all unbelievers should be arrested by the devil. If unbelievers are recording success, why should believers think that the devil is the one obstructing them from making progress in life? You have the name of Jesus, you have the word of God, you have the assembly of saints, you have the promises of God. Sinners do not have all these, yet they make progress.  **\nDeuteronomy 1 verse 6 to 8  **\n“Behold I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount;  **\n\tTurn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.  \ngive unto them and to their seed after them.”  **\n \n1.1 You Have Been Given Power to Overcome Stagnation  **\n \nIf sinners are making progress, why stand still and blame it on the devil? Rather, blame it on your ignorance, laziness and the darkness that covers you. Some blame it on witches and wizards and by so doing, they give almighty power to human beings. Whatever prayer they prayed, they believe that a witch was responsible for their lack of progress or success in life. If witches and wizard have that power, why have they not hindered everybody else? But what does the word of God say? “Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.” (Luke 10 verse19). Is that not God's word to you? Has witches and wizards more power than that? Then why do unbelievers succeed and make progress in life? who have no Holy Spirit in them nor the promises of God?  **\n \nPsalm 73 verse 12   **\n“Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.”   **\nOthers blame it on someone else saying, this man was responsible for my not going to school; this man was the reason why this thing or that thing happened to me. They are always looking for somebody to blame for their failures or misfortunes. This could be in matters of prolonged sickness or marriage, or joblessness, or delay in child-bearing, or poverty, or even death. **\nProverbs 6 verse 4 to11  **\n\t“Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.  \n\tDeliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.  \n\tGo to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:  \n\tWhich having no guide, overseer, or ruler,  \n\tProvideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.  \n\tHow long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?  \n\tYet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: \nSo shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.”   **\n \nNow, I am telling you that the time to overcome that problem has come. What I have been saying is historical because the reality is that you are coming out from that problem at this time and your life will begin to witness great progress and success. You will no longer be stagnated in Jesus Name. Amen. Through prayer, through counsel and wisdom, you will come out of your deplorable state triumphantly and you will make progress in life in Jesus name. Amen.   **\n \nIsaiah 3 verse 10   **\n“Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.”   **\nExodus 14 verse 13 to 15  **\n\t“And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation    of the LORD, which he will shew to you today, for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever. \n\tThe LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. \n\tAnd the LORD said unto Moses, wherefore criest thou unto me? Speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward:”   **\n \n1.2 Trust in the Lord and He Will Establish Your Goings  **\n \nProverbs 3 verse 1 to 6  **\n“My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments;  \nFor length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.  \n\tLet not mercy and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:  \n\tSo shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.  \n\tTrust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.  6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths”   **\n \n \nPsalms 40 verse 1 to 3  **\n“I waited patiently for the LORD; and He inclined unto me, and heard my cry.  \n\tHe brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.  \n\tAnd He hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God, many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.”   **\n \n“I waited patiently for the Lord; and He inclined unto me and heard my cry.” The Lord said I should tell you that He has heard all those prayers. He knows your patience. Actually, you have waited for Him for a long time; you waited for Him for years; and now the Lord said He has given attention to your cry. “He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.” You were stuck in one place, but now the Lord has stretched out His hands to help you. I am assuring you that the hands of your Father will reach down from Heaven to bring you out of that miry pit in which you found yourself. \nHe has come to pull you out of that pit. You could not move because of the muddy ground. Your feet were stuck in the clay. But now He will transport you to the rock. You will now move forward easily. In fact, you will run! When agricultural chicks have been in a cage and the door is suddenly opened for them, do you know that some of them jump and others fly? You will fly; you will fly to your destination. You will achieve great things very quickly. Your delay shall be rewarded. The Lord shall restore to you the years that the locusts, cankerworms, and palmerworms have eaten. For your sorrow, you shall receive double. You will fly. I mean grace is going to make you fly. Your classmates have passed you, but you will overtake them. The power of God, the grace of God, the love of God, and the mercy of God will locate you and work in your life. Amen!   **\n \n1.3 Be Determined for Success and Achievement  **\nMake up your mind today to be a new person. The old things should pass away and all things should become new. Make up your mind that the former things should pass, new things should now take place. Whereas you have been labouring without seeing the gain; from today believe that you will see your gains gathered together. \nThe mouth of the Lord has spoken it and the Lord will perform it for you. Receive the word from the mouth of God. Amen.  :**\n \nsecond Corinthians 4 verse13  **\n“We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;”   **\n \nBe resolved in your heart that you will never remain in your present situation of life. Just tell yourself, tell your environment, even the trees that are standing around you. Say to the tree: “Tree, you have been my neighbor for long and you have seen how wretched I have been; but tree, I am not going to be like that again. You will witness a new man.” Halleluiah! That sickness will die. Your poverty shall be taken away. Your marital depression shall cease. Your academic standstill shall come to an end. Amen.  **\n \nIsaiah 43 verse 18 to 23  **\n\t“Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.  \n\tBehold, I will do a new thing, now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.  \n\tThe beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls, because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.  \n\tThis people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.  \n\tBut thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O \nIsrael.”  \n \nGod has been waiting for you for long. Is He not the God of progress? When He made the sun and the moon and started counting days, is it not for progress? Have you not made progress in the years of your life? Then why not in other things? He is a God that wants you to make progress. I pronounce progress upon your life in Jesus Name. In fact, by this time next year, you will be full of testimonies. Yes, I am talking to you who are in stagnation today, because something is already waiting for your life. Halleluiah, Amen!  **\n \n1.4 The Four Lepers Refused To Sit Still And Die In Their State.  **\n \n Second Kings 7 verse 3 to 9  **\n\t“And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, why sit us here until we die?  \n\tIf we say, we will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.  \n\tAnd they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians, and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.  \n\tFor the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host; and they said one to another, lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.  \n\tWherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life.  \n\tAnd when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.   \n\tThen they said one to another, we do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us, now therefore come that we may go and tell the king's household.”   **\nIn this text, the Bible tells us about four lepers and the decision they took. That is the decision you are to take now. Four lepers won the victory! Four lepers won the war!! You will win the war!!! All those enemies that gather around and will not allow people to make progress or succeed will be silenced by your speedy progress. Now, make up your mind, arise and say, “I am moving forward. I will succeed in the name of the Lord of Hosts. I will make great achievements by the backing of the Lord of Hosts.” As you move, the miracles of God will move with you. As you move, the miracles of God will go ahead of you. The enemy shall see and flee. God has been waiting for you all this while. You have been so lazy that you could not move. You are looking like a lame man, but now, you will walk! Amen.   **\n \nMatthew 8 verse 2 and 3  **\n\t“And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. \n\tAnd Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.”  **\n \n1.5 Rise Up and Possess Your Possession   **\n \nIn my village, in those days, when a crippled child refuses to walk and the mother wants him to walk, what they do is to put him in a basket and pull him around saying, “Rise up and walk!” You will rise up and walk in Jesus name. The Lord is asking you to walk. Move forward and achieve something for God; achieve something for Jesus.   **\n  \nMatthew 14 verse 27 to 29  **\n\t“But straightway Jesus spoke unto them, saying, be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid. \n\tAnd Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water. \n\tAnd he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.”  **\nWhereas you have been living in one room with your wife, you are going to move to a 3-bedroom flat. God has been waiting for you. Miracles have been waiting for you. It shall happen. I say, it shall happen; there shall be a performance! A particular man needed money to organize a program for God. He said, “God I want to organize a crusade and I am looking for ten thousand dollars for that. When he finished that prayer, he started moving. As he was moving on to get the $10,000.00, the Holy Ghost moved along with him. That is what is going to happen to you.  \n \nTransformation is coming upon your life. Holy Spirit is going to enter in your life.  **\nAs he continued moving, the Holy Ghost spoke, “Enter into that house and ask whether the house is for sale.” He entered into the house and saw a lady there. He asked, “Is this house for sale?” The lady looked at him with surprise and asked him, “Did you see 'For Sale' written on the house?” The man of God answered, “Oh sorry, it was just laid in my heart to come and ask.” The lady then answered, “Actually, the owner of the house just took a decision to sell the house.” The man answered, “Oh, is that so? I am ready to buy it.” They struck a deal and the man of God went telling people that he had a house to sell. Let the wisdom of God come upon your life. Receive wisdom in Jesus name. ** \nProverbs 4 verse 5 to 7  **\n“Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. \n\tForsake her not, and she shall preserve thee, love her, and she shall keep thee. \nWisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom, and with all thy getting get understanding. “  **\n \nSo, the man of God quickly got a buyer because the Lord was waiting for him for his miracle. The Lord has been waiting for you for a miracle. He will do this thing Himself. You just stand up and take a step of faith. As soon as your leg shall touch River Jordan, it shall dry up. He got a buyer and struck the deal with him. The difference was ten thousand dollars. He collected the money from the buyer, removed his profit margin of $10,000.00 and gave the balance to the seller. This was how he got the money he asked of the Lord. That is the wisdom that is coming upon your life today. Your life shall be a testimony.  **\n \n1.6 The Day of Good News to You  **\n \n Second Kings 7 verse 8 to 9   **\n“And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.  \nThen they said one to another, we do not well; this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace; if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us; now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.”  \n \nMany people are waiting for you. There are some beggars who will come to you and say, “May God give to you that you may have to give us.” You will have it because God has lined up some people behind you and they are waiting for you. God wants to finance you. God wants to lift you up because of the people that are lined up and waiting for you to have. Where are you? God is waiting for you to take a step of progress, a step of success and a step of achievement, so that He may do His miracles in your life and through you, others will also be blessed. God will give you wisdom. He will give you counsel of what to do to end your poverty, your sickness, your shame and your disgrace. Amen.  **\n \nGenesis 12 verse 1 to 3   **\n“Now the Lord had said unto Abram, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee: \nAnd I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing; \nAnd I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee, and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.”  :**\n \n \n\nCHAPTER TWO   **\n \nWE ARE SERVING THE LIVING GOD   **\n \n2.1 God is Able to Turn Things Around for You Overnight  **\n \nGenesis 18 verse 9 to 14  **\n“And they said unto him, where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. \nAnd he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. \nNow Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. \nTherefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? \nAnd the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? \nIs any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.”  **\n \nI heard the story of a man in an oil rich State of Nigeria (Port Harcourt, Rivers State). This man had been poor and he knew that there is a GOD, His father who answers prayers. So he began to wonder why he should be poor. He decided to do something about his financial state. Remember I told you that God has been waiting for you. You are sitting there and saying you are waiting for God while God is saying I am waiting for you. Who is to make the first move? Is it God or you? Who is greater? Who should go first? So, the man went into a room and locked up himself for three days and was telling God, “God, you have to change my situation. I cannot remain in this poverty; I cannot remain in this state. No, my situation must change.”   **\nIsaiah 38 verse 1 to 7  **\n“ In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. \n Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the Lord, \nAnd said, remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. \nThen came the word of the Lord to Isaiah, saying, \nGo, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears, behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. \nAnd I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city. \nAnd this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord, that the Lord will do this thing that he hath spoken;”   **\n \nI have told you that your own situation is ending now. The man continued, “God you must change my state; you must prosper me; you must upgrade me; you must lift me up; you must show me the way; you must show me how I will achieve it.” He prayed until God said, “I have heard you My son. I have answered your prayer.” God is waiting to hear somebody's prayers. Then the Lord said, “can you see the parcel of land over there; where they dump refuse? He answered, “Yes, Lord.” God said to him, “Go and look for the owner and buy it.” Even though the voice that spoke to him was clear and unmistakable, he began to wonder why he would buy a parcel of land that is a refuse dump. But God had already spoken. He had been praying that God should prosper him and God has told him what to do. God will tell you what to do!   **\n \nJohn 2 verse 1 to 5  **\n“And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there; \nAnd both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. \nAnd when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, they have no wine. \nJesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come.\nHis mother saith unto the servants, whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.”   **\n \nThe man went and looked for the owner of the land who was surprised that somebody would come to buy such a waste land. The man bought the land and went back to God to say, “Lord I have bought the land.” God told him. “Okay, that is the answer to your prayer.” The ways of God may look foolish but that is the greatest wisdom. After some time, an oil company came to that area and discovered crude oil underneath the land. Poverty had ended with that man! Greatness had come; wealth had come; riches had come. Oh Lord, pour it upon your people now. The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof. That is what God wants to do in your life. That is what God wants to achieve in your life. Let the Lord grant you open door to prosperity. Let him open the door for your children; let him open the door for your family in the name of Jesus, Amen.  **\nRevelation 3 verse 8  **\n “I know thy works, behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it, for thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.”  **\n \n2.2 If People of the World Prosper by Carnal Wisdom How Much More You by Divine Wisdom? \n \nEven in matters of this life, human beings in natural wisdom of the earth (sometimes even sinful wisdom), are able to do something great for their lives.  **\n \nLuke 16 verse 1 to 8  **\n\t“And He said also unto his disciples, there was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.  \n\tAnd he called him, and said unto him, how is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.  \n\tThen the steward said within himself, what shall I do? For my lord taketh away from me the stewardship, I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.  \n\tI am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.  \n\tSo he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, how much owest thou unto my lord?  \n\tAnd he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.  \n\tThen said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.  \n\tAnd the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely; for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.”  **\n \nThis man was manager over a business but he wasted the money of the owner of the business. The man called him and said, now give account of your work because you cannot do this work again. That man is a sinner, but he used carnal wisdom, corrupt wisdom, to solve his problem. See what he did in verse three and four  **\n \nLuke 16 verse 3 to 4. ** \n\t“  Then the steward said within himself, what shall I do? For my lord taketh away from me the stewardship, I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.  \n\tI am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.”  **\n \nThrough carnal wisdom, he got a solution although a sinful one. He said, I have been used to easy money and I can no longer do any hard work. I cannot go to farm because my hands will tear in the farm. I cannot go on the street begging because that will be shameful. Moreover, I have a fair-complexioned skin that I have been maintaining through special diet. People will be wondering what is wrong with me. They may even think I have gone mad. What then will I do? Oh yes, I know what to do, he said to himself by carnal wisdom. You are better than that man, yet the man brought himself out of that problem. God will be the one to bring you out. Can God do it? Yes, He can.  **\n Isaiah 45 verse 22  **\n“ Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth for I am God, and there is none else.”   **\n \nLuke 16 verse 5 to 7.   **\n\t“So, he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, how much owest thou unto my lord?  \n\tAnd he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.  \n\tThen said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.”  **\n \nHe said to one of his master's debtors, “I am cutting your debt by half. Pay it quickly before my master comes. I do not want my master to know because I am doing you a favour.” To another owing one hundred measures of wheat, “I give you twenty free, so write eighty.” Meanwhile, he did not disclose to his master's debtors that he was about to lose his job. Rather, he gave them the impression that he was only doing them a favour. This kind of behaviour is characteristic of some State Governors of some states in Nigeria who pay salaries towards election time in order to get the votes of civil servants. That is the wisdom of the world. They have been owing salaries for years but when election is near and they want to come for a second term, they begin to pretend like they love the people. The governor will say, “I can see that the people are suffering and as a governor of mercy, I will pay them five months' salary arrears.” This is the wisdom of the world.  **\nVerse eight says, “And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.” Can you see? When the master of that steward came to hear what he did after he had left, he said these sinners are intelligent people. Now the steward could go about to tell the debtors he forgave part of their debt that he did not know what he did wrong that made his master to sack him. The people will wonder because they would say, but you are a nice man. Is it not you that reduced our debt owing to your master? Instead of one hundred measures of wheat we paid only eighty. The steward will tell them, “Oh I was showing mercy because I know you people are good.” So with this fine language, they will receive him into their houses and show him favour. That is wisdom displayed by people of the world. It delivered him from going to dig. It delivered him from going to beg.  **\nMark 8 verse 36 to 37   **\n\t“What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?  \n\tOr what can a man give in exchange for his soul? ”   **\n \n2. 3 You Need Divine Wisdom for Progress and Success in Life **\n \nBut there is a better and superior wisdom. There is the wisdom of restoration. It is the wisdom that will bring you back to life, restore you back to your position and a better state. This is a clean wisdom that God will supply. It is the wisdom that will bring promotion to your life. This is the wisdom the prodigal son exercised in his backslidden state and got restored again. **\n \nLuke 15 verse 14 to 24  **\n\t“And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.  \n\tAnd he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.  \n\tAnd he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.  \n\tAnd when he came to himself, he said, how many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!  \n\tI will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,  \n\tAnd am no more worthy to be called thy son, make me as one of thy hired servants.  \n\tAnd he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.  \n\tAnd the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son.  \n\tBut the father said to his servants, bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet;  \n\tAnd bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry; \n\tFor this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.”  **\n \nHere, the Bible tells us the story of the prodigal son. He got his father's wealth and wasted it. He became wretched and was in a pitiable state. He came to his senses and by divine wisdom he took a step that got him restored to his father's house and his privileges were restored to him. This is going to be your case in Jesus name. The wisdom you need in your life is the one that will restore you to divine blessings. This is the wisdom that will remove iniquity from you, remove evil and sin from you, and bring repentance to your life. It is the wisdom that will restore you to divine favour, divine riches and divine blessings. This is the wisdom you need in your life. You need the wisdom that will bring repentance to you and make you to confess your sins. The reason you became so wretched was that you wasted yourself with harlots, you went into drugs, you joined occultism and did all kinds of evil. You must be determined to stop these things, to turn to God and to live holy in order to enter into His blessing. This is the wisdom you need.  **\n \nIsaiah 1 verse 16 to 20  **\n\t“Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; \n\tLearn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow. \n\tCome now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. \n\tIf ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land; \n\tBut if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.”  **\n\nIn the two cases of the shrewd steward and the prodigal son that we have just considered, there was a determination not to remain in the same condition. There was a determination not to suffer poverty. There was a determination not to remain in wretchedness. That determination gave one of them carnal wisdom, though that kind of wisdom cannot last and cannot give the full desired result. But the divine wisdom applied by the prodigal son gave him total restoration, total favour, the approval of God and he was restored. The society went into celebration. May God receive you such that your family will go into celebration. Your society too should go into celebration because of you. Your brethren who knew your situation yesterday shall witness your glorious tomorrow and go into celebration. Be determined! This is what God wants you to do and He is ready to back you up.  **\n \nLuke 15 verse17 to 19  **\n “ And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! \n\tI will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, \n\tAnd am no more worthy to be called thy son, make me as one of thy hired servants.” **\n \n2.4 Wisdom and Holiness Are Two of a Kind  **\n \nNow is your time to receive divine wisdom. God will give you wisdom. Wisdom is the principal thing. Wisdom is the most important thing. As far as this life is concerned, the two highways are the Highway of Holiness and the Highway of Wisdom. They are like two success power, but they are actually one success power – wisdom and holiness. They speak of the same thing. Holiness is God and Wisdom is God. It is your time to receive wisdom.  **\n \nProverbs 8 verse1 to 7, 12 to 21  **\n\t “  Doth not wisdom cry? And understanding put forth her voice?  \n\tShe standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.  \n\tShe crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.  \n\tUnto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.  \n\tO ye simple, understand wisdom; and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.  \n\tHear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.  \n\tFor my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  \n\tI wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.  \n\tThe fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.  \n\tCounsel is mine, and sound wisdom, I am understanding; I have strength.  \n\tBy me kings reign, and princes decree justice.  \n\tBy me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.  \n\tI love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.  \n\tRiches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.  \n\tMy fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.  \n\tI lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:  \n\tThat I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.”   **\n \nMaybe somebody interceded for you that God should remember you in your condition and today God wants to remember you. Maybe the saints of old prayed that the Lord would open the windows of Heaven towards the end time and pour riches and wealth, honour and glory upon his children above what the devil has given to his own so that the people will see the glory of God that more souls should be converted. Maybe they have prayed like that and that is why the Lord now says, “I am starting it now.” The Lord is starting it now. He will pour down wealth, riches, honour, promotion and lift up the Lord's people. The Lord is starting it now and I am so happy that you will become rich by this move of God. This is wonderful! Sister, your honour will increase. My brother, people shall marvel when they visit your house and you take them round your duplex and they see cars parked all round your compound. When they read what you wrote on your wall saying, “Jesus is the owner of this House,” they will wonder at what great thing Jesus has done in your life. They will say, so Jesus can make somebody great like this. Now, will you allow Jesus to start with you? Go and get ready. Some think preachers are poor people. Are you seeing me a poor man? Wealth and riches belong to God and He gives to His children.  :**\nProverbs 8 verse17 to 21  **\n\t“I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. \n\tRiches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. \n\tMy fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. \n\tI lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment;\n\tThat I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.”  **\n \nA particular preacher who had a master's degree said that when he was answering the call into full time ministry to preach, his relations said, “Oh, we pity you. We pity you because you will soon be picking oranges that people have sucked and thrown on the ground.” God wants to rebuke and silence those people by the quantum of the glory and honour and riches He shall be pouring upon your life. Amen. Because of you, many shall run to the Lord. They will realize that it is with the Lord things are happening. They shall run to the Lord to receive their own blessing. By this God is making a bold statement: “I do make people rich!”   **\n \nNOW, HOW DO YOU GET THIS WISDOM? VERY SIMPLE!  **\n \nProverbs 2 verse1 to 11  **\n\t“My son, if thou wilt receive My words, and hide My commandments with thee;  \n\tSo that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;  \n\tYea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;  \n\tIf thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;  \n\tThen shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.  \n\tFor the LORD giveth wisdom; out of His mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.  \n\tHe layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous, He is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.  \n\tHe keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of His saints.  \n\tThen shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.  \n\tWhen wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;  \n Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:”   **\n \nThis is the wisdom that God gave Job. The Lord is bringing the days of Job to be replicated in our own time where riches and honour shall go with righteousness. It is not that God will give you riches and you will abandon Him. No! Job did not abandon God, so you will not abandon Him. Your salary shall increase and you will not abandon God. You will still continue to do righteousness. To some people, when you are riding a good car they interpret it to mean that you are wasting God's money. Somebody came to me to narrate a dream but I gave him another interpretation. He said, “Pastor, I dreamt that some people came from abroad and bought a big aircraft for you and they also added a helicopter. They said the aircraft is for you to go from nation to nation while the helicopter is to move from village to village. Praise the Lord!” I said, okay I understand. The Lord is saying that I will be going from nation to nation and He will also help me to go from village to village. However, if they bring that aircraft, will I say “No”? Not at all, because we don't know the plan of God.  **\n \n2.5 You Have Challenged God with Holiness, He Will Challenge You with His Blessing.   **\n \nGenesis 22 verse 15 to 18   **\n\t“And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, \n\tAnd said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son; \nThat in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; \n\tAnd in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.”   **\n \nI am saying, get ready. We have challenged God with holiness; surely, He will challenge us with His blessing. The Lord told Solomon that he did not ask for riches or honour; rather, he asked for wisdom to rule God's people to bring glory to God. God's response was: “Now riches, and honour, and glory and all, I have added to you. Can anybody tell God to stop it? He is doing it for Himself and for His glory. I am preparing you because, who knows, tomorrow you may become a great political leader in the nation. It should not surprise you because God wants to disprove sinners who have relegated His name to the background and attached wretchedness to His children. So He is saying, “No, I am the Owner of the world and creator of all things”. He is saying, “Riches and honour are with Me. By me kings' rule and princes decree justice.” Just worship God. He has promised to make your paths straight, to level your hill, and to prepare a highway for His children to walk upon. His children are going to pass through that highway. He says, “I am preparing a highway of righteousness; a highway of riches; a highway of wealth and a highway of honour. You will walk on it.” Halleluiah, amen. Cry for wisdom. Pray for it. Just an idea that will drop into your heart shall make a difference. The Lord is the owner of creative ideas. He says, “I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.” I wisdom dwell with intelligence and bring about discovery. The Lord will give you ideas and you are going to make progress. People will come and stand before you. People will come to consult you by reason of the discoveries and inventions you will make.  His name shall be promoted in your life. Halleluiah!  **\n \n First Chronicles 1 verse 9 to 10  **\n\t“And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabta, and Raamah, and Sabtecha. And the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. \n\tAnd Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be mighty upon the earth.”  **\nIt is not easy to preach the gospel to the evangelical churches and some of the orthodox churches. However, the Lord in his mercy made one of our brothers to have political influence over about six or seven local governments in his state. I then told him, “Thank God for the authority He has given you over the people. In your authority and favour, could you tell all the ministers of the gospel in your community to assemble together for a Christian conference?  **\n \nFirst of all, he invited the ministers to his house for a lunch. About two hundred pastors came together and I was there to minister the word of God to them. Some were ancient preachers; some began preaching, maybe before, I was born or maybe when I was still a small boy.   **\n \nWisdom gave me the opportunity to preach to them. Wisdom will do it in your life too. That was not all. It was only the first step. I requested him to send out another invitation requesting that all of the ministers with their elders should come for a conference in a local government center and that he should transport them, accommodate them and feed them. We would preach the word of God to them and put inspired gospel materials in their hands. By the time this invitation went out, seven hundred ministers of the gospel were gathered together. We went there and preached to them. We recorded the messages and put it in their hands. The books we brought were shared to all of them. Halleluiah! Suppose the Lord makes such a brother to be the governor or the president of Nigeria, it will be too great and wonderful! We will just be clapping our hands that revival time has come in the state or nation.   **\n \nSecond Timothy 1verse 16 to 18  **\n\t“ The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; \n\tBut, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me. \n\tThe Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well’’  **\nsecond John verse 8 and 12  **\n“  Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. \n Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink, but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.”  **\n \nThis is why the Lord is interested in promoting you. When He promotes you, God will be glorified and promoted in the eyes of men by you. As you are promoted, you are lifting up Jesus. Whatever the Lord does, He does it in His wisdom and for His glory. Ask for wisdom; ask for ideas. It will make a difference in your life. Your stagnated church will blossom. The people that are not coming will start running in. Ask God to tell you what to do. Let him tell you how to go about it. Let Him tell you the style of evangelism you are to use. Let him tell you the steps and processes to follow. He is a God of ideas. I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions. (Proverbs 8 verse 12). He said, “Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.” (Matthew 7 verse7).  The Lord is changing people this time; your mentality shall change.   **\nsecond Chronicles 1 verse 6 to 12  **\n\t“And Solomon went up thither to the brazen altar before the Lord, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it. \n\tIn that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him,  Ask what I shall give thee. \n\tAnd Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead. \n\tNow, O Lord God, let thy promise unto David my father be established; for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. \n\tGive me now wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can judge this thy people that is so great? \n\tAnd God said to Solomon, because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king: \n\tWisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.”  **\n \nThere was a particular pastor in the 80's. At that time, it was considered a waste of money to have a rug carpet in your house. It was like wasting money that would have been used for the gospel work. To have rug carpet or cushion chair was very rare. When some church members visited his house and saw cushion chairs and rugs, they concluded that the man had backslidden and gone into the world. Meanwhile, it happened that the pastor got the items as a gift. When a company was auctioning them, somebody bought them and asked the pastor if he needed them. The pastor accepted and they brought them to his house. The report reached their headquarters that the man had backslidden. The headquarters, being ignorant of the promises of God and lacking in understanding of His will placed the pastor on discipline.  They had no knowledge that God is not a God of poverty. They lacked understanding that God wants to bless His people. They did not understand that the riches of the earth belong to Him. He said “I will give you the riches of hidden places”.   **\n \nI am praying that the Lord will change your mentality. You will know that God wants you to have the blessings of life. That God wants you to make progress; and for you to know that there are people lining up behind you waiting to tap into your blessing.  They are waiting so that you will bless them and better their lives. By your acts of charity that will make many enter into the Kingdom of God.  Thank you, Jesus. You get wisdom through prayer.   **\nJames 1 verse 5   **\n“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him”.  **\n \n Lift up your voice for understanding. Take a time to fast and pray to God for progressive ideas, transforming ideas. Ask God for it, He will give it to you. He will open your brain and put it there. You will blossom.   **\n \n\nfirst Timothy 6 verse 17 to 19  **\n\t“ Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; \n\tThat they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; \n\tLaying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.”  **\n \nCHAPTER THREE   **\n\nGET GOOD COUNSEL FOR YOUR SUCCESS  **\n\nSecond Samuel 16 verse 23  **\n“ And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.”   **\n \n3.1 Seek Counsel to Avoid the Fall  **\n \nI want you to know that counsel is important. The Lord directs you to seek counsel. Many of you do your things without counseling and that is why you fail. You assume that you are all mighty in yourself; taking decisions without contacting somebody and without saying, “God I need your guidance, I need more ideas.” God will direct you to see somebody more experienced than you on that matter. The person will tell you what to do. When God called Paul the apostle, he asked him to go into the city where he would find a man who would tell him what to do. But you do not want to refer to any man; you are not seeing any man; you just take up a thing and do it. You go into any venture and just move forward. That is why you fail.  **\n \nProverbs 11 verse 14   **\n“Where no counsel is, the people fall, but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.”  **\n \nCan you see why you failed many times? It is because you did not seek counsel. Whatever comes to your mind, you just go ahead to execute it without praying through for guidance. You go ahead without seeking counsel to know whether the thought in your mind is correct or not. You ought not to have done that. In the church, you have your pastor but you don't bother to see him for counsel. That is the reason why you fail. Proverbs 15 verse 22 \nWithout counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors, they are established.   \n \nYou want to marry? No counsel; no advice. Whoever you choose, you go ahead to marry. That is your style. You dreamt a dream and you woke up to go and carry out what you dreamt about. Who told you that the Lord spoke in that dream? You did not bother to verify. That is why you failed. The devil gets you cheaply. Your mind is so simple that you are easily carried away. That is why God is asking you to check it up by counseling; by a multitude of counselors. Even in secular matters, there are specialists in various fields that you need their counsel on how a thing should be done. They are trained people; they are learned; they have understanding in that field and you need to consult them to receive sufficient counsel. If this be so in secular world, how much more in Christ? An idea came to your mind and you want to go and start a ministry? You just move without consultations from people higher than you to ask questions on your dreams and feelings? You may have dreamt that you were preaching before a multitude and you are thinking that that is a calling into the preaching ministry. You did not seek counsel, but you just went ahead and fall and go to hell! Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.  **\n \nProverbs 20 verse 18  **\n“Every purpose is established by counsel, and with good advice make war ”.  \n \nEvery purpose; ministerial, family, marital, business; every purpose is established by counsel. We your pastors are here for you. Do not just rise up and get into a venture without counsel or just take your bag and travel without anybody being aware. That is not the mind of God for you; that is not a Christian life. Counsel is important. It is the will of God for your life.  **\n \n3.2 Seek Good Counsellors for Your Success   **\n \nSecond Samuel 16 verse 23  **\n“And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God, so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.”   **\n \nThe counsel of Ahithophel was perfect. It was as if you went to meet with God and you sat with Him and asked Him to tell you if what you want to venture into will work out. If Ahithophel told you “No,” Do not do it.” It was as if God spoke to you. His counsel was just perfect! Whatever Ahithophel counseled you to do was just like God speaking. God put His wisdom in people for your good. He granted some people the opportunity to receive some training or acquire some skills for service to humanity. God puts gifts in people. He has given people various gifts and training for your good. So, why are you not consulting them?  Problems are going on in your family between you and your spouse and you are not consulting those who know better how to solve it? For ten years now, you have never been at peace with your spouse, but you never went for counseling to know what to do. You stay there in darkness waiting to die and go to hell while people around you are not aware of what you are passing through. Perhaps you and your spouse sleep on the same bed but face difference directions. What is the reason for that? Have you sought counsel? May be your own story is that your wife despises you. But have you sought for counsel to find out what you should do or what you are doing that you should stop doing? Have you tried that? Have you seen the man of God?   :**\n \n \nfirst Samuel 9 verse 6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19 to 20  **\n\t“ And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass, now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go. \n\tThen said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? \n\tAnd the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. \n\t(Before time in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) \n\tThen said Saul to his servant, well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was. \n\tNow the Lord had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, \n\tTomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. \n\tAnd Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and tomorrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart. \n\tAnd as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house?”  **\n \nIn Jos, Plateau State of Nigeria, a man visited his friend in the hospital who was a doctor. He said to him, “Doctor, I am now putting my house in order because I know I will soon die.” The Doctor asked, “What is wrong with you?” He said, “I have a sharp pain in my chest which is burning inside me seriously. We have prayed and fasted and done everything about and I know there is no solution to it. So I know I will soon die.” As the conversation went on, the Doctor began to prepare Mist Mag Solution. He asked to know what preparation his friend was making for his death and he began to explain to him. As the conversation continued, the doctor gave him the medication to drink. After some minutes, the doctor asked him how he was feeling. The friend replied I am surprised, the pain has started to reduce and I may not be dying again.  **\n \nPsalm 118 verse 15 to 17  **\n“The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous; the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.\nThe right hand of the LORD is exalted; the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.”  **\nI shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord. \nYou have a case and you refused to consult those who know better. Do you think that God has only one-way approach to solving problems? Some of you belong to these churches that say you should not take drugs. They tell you not to go to the hospital because the doctor is an unbeliever. That is darkness! The sick seeks for physicians to get healed; but you say you will not take drugs and you are actually dying because you refused to take counsel. The Bible says “Where no counsel is, the people perish.” The counsel of Ahithophel in those days was as if a man consulted an oracle. Have you had such an experience where someone gave you a counsel and it worked perfectly? Yes of course! Why should you keep your problem to yourself and be perishing in your situation because you are too ashamed to let another person hear your story? You want to keep your secret and the Lord says, “No, tell somebody!”  You are praying for God to do it for you privately, but he is asking you to tell somebody and bury your pride.  **\n \nMatthew 11 verse 28 to 29   **\n\t“ Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. \n\tTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest unto your souls.”  **\n \nProverbs 22 verse 4   **\n“ By humility and the fear of the Lord are riches, and honour, and life.”   **\n \n3.3 Counselors Are the Gifts of God for Your Well Being  **\n \n first Corinthians 3 verse 22 to 23  **\n“Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours; \n And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.”   **\n \n \nSecond Kings 5 verse 2 to 5, 14   **\n\t“And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife. \n\tAnd she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy. \n\tAnd one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel. \n\tAnd the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment. \n Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.”  **\n \nA maid from Israel served Naaman's wife. When she saw the leprosy of her master, she spoke to the wife, “Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.” They took the counsel. Naaman went to Samaria and was directed to Elisha. Elisha sent messengers to him that he should go to River Jordan and dip himself there seven times and he would be healed. The man was angry as if he should see Elisha and smite him. “Big man like me, am I a fool to go and be dropping myself in water as if I am a child.” In his anger he considered returning back to Syria. Then another counselor came up. His servants came closer and said, my master if the man of God had told you to do something greater would you not have done it? What does it cost you to just go and dip yourself in water seven times?  We do not see the reason for your anger.  That word of advice calmed him down. He said “Okay where is the river, Jordan?” And they went to river Jordan. He went into the river and came out seven times. I think he might have been calculating what he would do after he finished and nothing happened. May be the nation of Israel as a whole would have suffered the consequence. But by the seventh time, he marveled by the miracle that took place. His body became completely clean and free of age-long leprosy.   **\n \nJeremiah 30 verse 17   **\n “ For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.”  **\n \nHumble yourself and take advice; humble yourself and seek advice over your life’s disorder. Your issue may be the challenge of child bearing or getting a marriage partner. May be your own issue is about business failure or joblessness. Get some counsel. God is encouraging you to take that advice; believe it and do it! Naomi gave counsel to Ruth. She gave her counsel on how to get a husband. Boaz is your next of-kin, do these things I have told you and come back to tell me the result. The counsel worked for Ruth in righteousness and holiness. You too, take counsel; take advice. There are some of you whose mind is on a particular man for marriage. To you, if you do not marry that man, then you will not marry again. Who told you that? Do you want to die? The disappointment you had was a disappointment of life. It was God saving you from marrying a wrong person and you are saying God must give you that man or God must give you that woman? What do you mean by that? Understand the word of God in your persistent disappointment in that area.   **\n \nRomans 8 verse 28.  **\n” And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.”\nMay be your own case is that different men have been coming for you but you have been rejecting them. Be careful because the Lord will stop them from coming. Do not turn this thing into pride. There are more beautiful people out there who have never had a man ask for their hand in marriage but you are misusing your opportunity. If you continue this way, the Lord will reward your pride. Humble yourself. Before you say “No,” let it be God speaking in you and not that you despise a child of God. You might have been rejecting them because you see them as inferior to you. Who told you that? Do you know yourself or your rank? Who is your equal? Is it Satan? Humble yourself. Do not despise any man. Despise not the days of little beginning. Take counsel. If you are not clear about your dreams, go and check up with mature people who can interpret your dream correctly. Let them give you advice so that you will not waste all your opportunities and nobody comes for you again.  **\n  \nExodus 18 verse 13 to 24   **\n\t“And it came to pass on the morrow that Moses sat to judge the people; and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. \n\tAnd when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, what is this thing that thou doest to the people? Why sits thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? \n\tAnd Moses said unto his father-in-law, because the people come unto me to inquire of God;\n\tWhen they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. \n\tAnd Moses' father-in-law said unto him, the thing that thou doest is not good. \n\tThou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. \n\tHearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to Godward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: \n\tAnd thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. \n\tMoreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: \n\tAnd let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee. \n\tIf thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. \n\tSo Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.”  **\n \nMoses' father-in-law gave counsel to relieve the burden of Moses. He saw that Moses counseled the people from morning till night. He knew that would make him to be worn out. God gives protection and grace but there are some natural laws that He will not want to break. So be careful, use wisdom. Share the work so that you can live long. Also, so that those waiting to see you may not be worn out by the long hours you keep them waiting. That counsel given by Moses' father-in-law worked! Seek advice, don't be proud. Pride is the reason for your fall. Where pride is there is a fall. Pride goes before a fall. Be humble to take advice.  **\n \nProverbs 10 verse 4  **\n“He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand, but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.”  **\nProverbs 29 verse 23  **\n“A man's pride shall bring him low; but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.”  :**\n \n3.4 Take Counsel from the Man of God   **\n \nMalachi 2 verse 4 to 7   **\n\t“And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that My covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.  \n\tMy covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before My Name.  \n\tThe law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.  \n\tFor the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.”   **\nGod puts His words in the mouth of His anointed ministers. They may not even know anything. It is when you come that God will speak to you through them. They are the oracle of God. Go to them. Why do you sideline your ministers that are anointed, holy and righteous and go about doing things anyhow? The priest keeps knowledge waiting for you; the law of the Lord is in his mouth. If you want to know the will of God, go and ask him. Tell him the business you are thinking about and he will tell you the mind of God. Immediately you speak to him, the Lord will direct him on what to tell you. God is waiting for you for your good.  **\n \nSecond Kings 3 verse 11 to12   **\n\t“But Jehoshaphat said, is there not here a prophet of the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah. \n\tAnd Jehoshaphat said, the word of the Lord is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.”  **\n \nTODAY IS YOUR DAY OF CHANGE **\n \nHebrews 11 verse 1 to 3 **\n“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. \n\tFor by it the elders obtained a good report. \n\tThrough faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.” **\n \nIf you agree today that your life will not be the same again. For many that are behind in education, God will open the way and register you in a school. The power of God shall work for you and enroll you in that university you have been longing to get admission into. Make up your mind that you will not be jobless again and the door shall open for you. You are better than the four lepers. The Lord followed them to make a way for them. He even drove away mighty hosts of army for them. The Lord will go with you and perform wonders for your life. Do not fear any roadblock because the Lord will remove that blockage. The Lord will remove that thing that blocked the road. That sickness shall be taken away because you have made up your mind that you will not be the same again. **\n  \nIsaiah 10 verse 13  **\n“ For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent, and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:”  **\n \nThe prodigal son said, “I will arise and go to my father. I will not eat the bread of sorrow any longer. I am going on now with a changed life and the Lord says, “Amen” to that. Shortly, the Lord shall be releasing a people He has graduated to success. As you enter into your house, look at the bed you have been laying on and say bye-bye to the company of rats that have been struggling for space with you on that bed at night because that bed will be changed. The Lord will give you a bigger bed. You will roll from one end to the other. The Lord will satisfy you with good things. Begin to rejoice that your life will not be the same again. The lord will give you ideas of progress. Prosperity shall come your way. You will eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of God who has done wondrously for your life. Amen.  **\n \nSecond Chronicles 20 verse 20  **\n“ And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the Lord your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.”  **\n \nLuke 5 verse 1 to 7   **\n\t“And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, \n\tAnd saw two ships standing by the lake, but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets. \n \n\tAnd he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. \n\tNow when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. \n\tAnd Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the net. \n\tAnd when they had this done, they in closed a great multitude of fishes; and their net brake. \n\tAnd they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.” **\n",

      "body": "THE DOCTRINE OF CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE FOR UNIFORM PRACTICE **\n\n\nThe greatest delight of men and women on earth is Jesus Christ. To know Jesus and live with Him is the most excellent thing a man or woman can obtain on earth. Love Jesus above a man, a woman, or a child. Love Jesus above your wife, your husband and your child. Desire to live with Jesus in heaven forever.  **\nProverbs. 8 verse 35 and 36  **\n“For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the Lord.  \nBut he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul, all they that hate me love death”.   **\n Philippians 3 verse 8  **\n“ Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord,  for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,”   **\n \nLET JESUS GUIDE YOU TO WHOM YOU SHOULD MARRY  **\nWhen you choose to serve God and obey His word, the Lord will also love you and become interested in you to do good things for your life. That will encourage you to continue to obey Him. Repent of your sins, obey and serve the Lord Jesus Christ. Then ask Him for a suitable and good marriage partner for yourself and you will be surprised of the blessed gift of a marriage partner that He will give you. Prov. 19 verse 14. Children of God should not marry unbelievers. Unbelievers are people who are still living in sin. Some are of other religions, while some are Christians by religion, but are disobedient and ungodly. You can know them by their life style and evil dressing. Ask well to know the Christian life of the person.  **\n \nSecond Corinthians 6 verse 14 to 16.  **\n“ Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers, for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?  \nAnd what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?  \nAnd what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”  **\nThe following scriptures show that you should not marry somebody who has been in a right marriage relationship with a man or with a woman but later backslided and divorced the man or woman. Hence before you accept to marry someone, check the marital history of that person to avoid fornication and adultery. in marriage. Those married, should still confirm this.  **\nLuke 16 verse 18  **\n“Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery, and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.”   **\n Romans 7 verse 2 and 3   **\n“For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.   \nSo then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress, but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.”   **\n \nWhen a man goes into correct marriage with a woman, having followed due procedures, that marriage union remains binding. The individuals in the marriage, the parents, the court of law or the Church can never nullify their marriage. Do not think that divorce letter from the court has authority to cancel a true marriage that God had joined together   **\nMatthew 19 verse 6   **\n“Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.”   **\nDo not take a woman to stay with you in the name of marriage without the consent of her parents. That is sin in the sight of God who sees you as a thief.  Go and settle with her parents. Pay her dowry, or request parental consent to marry her and pay dowry later.   **\n \nCOURTSHIP   **\nThis is a provision made for the intending marriage partners to interact with themselves, discuss and plan how their future marriage and family shall be like. It is a period of time for the partners to know themselves, judge themselves and determine whether or not to continue based on what the individuals deduced during the period. Courtship period is delicate and tempting. The church must supervise the intending partners well during courtship to keep them from acts of defilements and immorality. Keep yourself pure. The dowry should be paid after courtship. Do not wed immoral partners in the church. That defiles the alter of God.   **\n \nMEDICAL TESTS   **\nMany marriages get affected in later time and the eternal life of the marriage partners get jeopardized because some adverse health or physiological conditions of the body were not known due to lack of medical tests before marriage. Medical tests and verification are required to know the availability and fitness of the genitals, HIV Aids status, and genotype to guide against children with sickle cell.   **\n  \n \nTHE WEDDING    **\nChurch wedding must follow a certified document signed by the appropriate person(s) from the bride's family showing that she has been duly released for marriage. The attire of the bridegroom and especially of the bride and bride’s maids must be holy. It is better sown that rented. Every form of pride and worldliness must be avoided. The decorations, receptions and all activities should give glory to God. No wedding ring or any form of jewelry should be used. The bride's hairdo must be godly. Do all things to the glory of God. Pregnancy test is required to avoid wedding a pregnant lady.     **\n \nWHAT MAKES MARRIAGE BINDING   **\nWhen a man who has never married and a woman who has never married agree to marry each other, the next thing to do is to seek parental consent, especially of the woman. The lady's parents may require dowry payment. This needs to be settled or proper agreement should be made with the parents to release her for marriage, without dowry or with part-payment of it until later time, if you do not have all their demand now. Next to this is an occasion when the woman should be released to you for marriage. In many traditions, the first marriage celebration is the day when dowry is being paid. During this day the parents of the lady and representatives of the parents of the man assemble together for the bride price or dowry to be paid. During this day the parents receive the full dowry or part of it and enter into agreement to release their daughter to the man for marriage. Some call this traditional wedding.  \nWhere church wedding is not intended by the couple, the bride’s parents release their daughter for marriage that day and the man can take her home as a wife to cleave with her in sexual relationship to become one flesh.   **\nMatthew 19 verse 5   **\n“And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh?”   **\nHowever, when there is agreement between the parents and the intending partners that their marriage should consummate in church wedding, then dowry payment or traditional marriage, as it is called by some cultures, is not the consummation of the marriage process, but the church wedding. In this case, after dowry payment the bride remains under the authority of the parents until the church wedding day when she shall be released at the church to her husband. Before then, they must not have sex with each other. If that happens, it is sin because they are not yet married. Up to this point, the marriage can be dissolved and the dowry returned, because church wedding where the marriage process should be completed, has not taken place.   **\n \nONE FLESH IN MARRIAGE.   **\nGenesis 24 verse 6.  **\n“And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her...” (They became one flesh after sex)  **\n \nAfter the wedding, sexual intercourse engaged in by the newly wed makes them one flesh. They cannot be separated again for marriage to another till one of them dies. However, in the event that the man or woman has no sexual parts or impaired sexual parts that defy medical treatment, but has deceived the partner, the marriage union must be disannulled because of the place of sex in marriage. This does not apply to ill-health in a husband or wife after many years of marriage.   **\nMatthew  19 verse 12   **\n“For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb, and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men...”  **\nFirst Corinthians. 7 verse 1 to 5 \n“Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me, It is good for a man not to touch a woman. \nNevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.  \nLet the husband render unto the wife due benevolence; and likewise also the wife unto the husband.  \nThe wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.  \nDefraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency”.    **\nSuch matters should be made open to a godly church authority for investigation and conclusion.    **\nMatthew 18 verse 18.  **\n‘Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”  **\n \nTHE PURPOSE OF MARRIAGE   **\nGod did not make provision for more than one wife for any man. Polygamy is a sin. \nFrom the scriptures God ordained marriage for the following:   **\ni.\tFellowship, friendship and love. (Genesis 2 verse 18).  **\nii.\tSexual pleasure in righteousness and purity. (Proverbs 5 verse18 and19).   **  \niii.\tChild bearing. (Genesis 1 verse 28).\niv.\tPurity in human society and the church. (First Corinthians 7 verse 2).  **      \nv.\t  Mutual protection. (Genesis 20 verse16).  **\nvi.\tTo work together in Gods commission. (Genesis 2 verse18). **\nvii.\tBecause two are better than one. (Ecclesiastes 4 verse 9 to12).  **\n \nDo not deny each other sex, neither should sex be carried out in uncleanness against the law of decency. Do not imitate ungodly sexual approaches from those possessed by evil spirits, as in blue films, nor watch it to defile your heart before God.   **\n \n \nTHE ROLE OF THE WIFE IN MARRIAGE. **\nEphesians 5 verse 22 to 24.  **\n“ Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.  \nFor the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the body.  \nTherefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.”   **\n \nThe scripture instructs the wife to submit herself to her own husband as she submits to Christ. She should accept the authority and leadership of the husband over her and obey him with respect and reverence, as Sarah obeyed Abraham. The wife and all that she has gotten in the marriage belong to her husband and he must not be denied of them. The wife should submit her body to her husband. Women should learn to do good to and please their husbands. Submit to your husband in everything and God will bless and promote you, and give you life eternal in Jesus name He will make you enjoy peace.   **\nFirst Peter 3 verse 1,5 and 6.   **\n“ Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; \n For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:  \n Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.”   **\nDo not be soon angry, rude or stubborn to your husband. Do not lie to him. However, marriage to a man does not mean the woman’s soul is under the man's control. No! Her soul is under the control of God, Love God above your husband. Anytime the rule or demand of your husband goes against the word of God, you must politely, humbly but firmly refuse to obey him and be ready even to separate from him and stay aside to serve your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, if the man insists on your disobedience to God. The woman is to take good care of the children and the home.   **\n \nActs 4 verse 19 and 20.   **\n“But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. \n  For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.”   **\nActs 5 verse 28 to 29   **\n“Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.  \nThen Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.”   **\n \nTHE ROLE OF THE HUSBAND   **\nEphesians 5 verse 25 to 28. \n“ Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; \n That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,  \nThat he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.  \nSo ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.”   **\nThe scripture instructs the husband to do the following in the marriage and family. ** \n\ni. Love your wife so much as Christ loved the church. **\nii. Provide the needs of your wife and family. iii. Sacrifice for your wife to make her glorious to your satisfaction and joy. **\niv.\tNever be bitter, angry or frustrating to your wife. Do not speak roughly or despitefully to your wife. **\nv.\tCherish and honor your wife. Learn to forgive her failures. Learn to engage in friendly discussion with her.  ** vi. Teach and educate your wife for better understanding and holy living before God.  **\nvii. Never exalt yourself above your wife, but see her as co-equal with yourself before God in all ways.   **\nA good husband will not treat his wife as a slave, or want to bring her to shame before the children or in public. It is evil to beat your wife either by cane or by hand. Ask God to tell you what you can do to make your wife happy so that she may love and bless you more. Protect your wife from your relations, neighbors and friends. Jointly bring up your children for God in good education. Follow these rules and God will bless you.  **\n \nIf children are not born to the marriage, do not see the fault as coming from your wife alone; it may come from you too, hence; cooperate with your wife in prayers and medical efforts, where required, for the problem to be solved. Both of you must learn to be patient before God like Sarah and Abraham, Elizabeth and Zachariah, until God visits you with fruitfulness. Do not yield to societal shame. Do not deny your wife sex. Look for solution for sexual dysfunction in your marriage. Give yourself to prayers. Seek good marriage counsellors to help your marriage and family. Give attention to the welfare of your children. Do not abandon them to their mother.  **\n \nFAMILY PLANNING \nProverbs 25 verse 16. \n“Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.”    **\n \nFamily planning is essential for birth control. It is not wise at this time to have too many children. Feeding, medication, education and training of too many children can make life bitter and frustrating. Use good family planning method suitable for your body and control the number of children in the family. It is not a sin to do so as many people think. Do not use any method that will kill a child already formed in the worm. That is murder!    **\nProverbs 4 verse7 and 11.    **\n “ Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom, and with all thy getting get understanding.  \n I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths”.   **\n \nNO DIVORCE AND REMARRIAGE    **\n First Corinthians 7 verse 10 to 16.    **\n“And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband; \nBut and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband; and let not the husband put away his wife. \nBut to the rest speak I, not the Lord, If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.  \nAnd the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.  \nFor the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband, else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.  \nBut if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases, but God hath called us to peace.  \nFor what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?”  ** \n \nA scripturally certified married couple is one flesh and cannot separate to get married to another person, until the death of one of them. However, the Bible allows separation because of unbearable wickedness that may come from one of the marriage partners, which is witnessed by the church and the society. In such a case, the separated person must remain unmarried or be reconciled again to the other partner. Know that adultery does not separate marriage, only fornication does. (John 8 verse 3 to 11). (Matthew 5 verse 32). Adultery is sexual immorality committed by a married person, while fornication is sexual immorality committed by unmarried person. All those who divorce their partner because of adultery and married another are committing adultery in the sight of God, (Romans 7 verse 2 and 3).    **\nIf one of the partners refuses to return but gets married to another person who has never married, they are into fornication and adultery and will end up in hell fire. When the Bible says, “If the unbeliever departs let him or her depart,” it does not release the other partner to remarry. That will still be adultery. The believing partner should remain unmarried and should know that he or she is not hindered from engaging in the service of God because of the departure of the marriage partner. He or she should be available before God for His service according to His will. Use your single life to serve the Lord wholeheartedly.  **\nFirst Corinthians 7 verse 27 and 32.  **\n “Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.  \n But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord.”  **\n \nMARRIAGE AND MINISTRY   **\nFirst Timothy 3 verse 4, 5 and 11. **\n“One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;  \n(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)  \n Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.”   **\nIt is required in ministry that the minster should keep a good and well controlled family, having the wife and children living righteously before God so that the name of the Lord be not blasphemed. Proper godly dressing and character is expected of them, (Genesis 18 verse18 and 19).   **\n \nRESTITUTION IN MARRIAGE   **\nGenesis 20 verse 2 to 7.  **\n“And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.  \nBut God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man's wife.\n  But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation?  \n Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother; in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. \n And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.  \n Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live, and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.”   **\nIf a man leaves the first legal wife which he married properly in scriptural way, and marries another woman, he has offended God. The same thing applies to a woman. \nThe judgment of God for this is hell fire.   **\nMark 10 verse 11 and 12.   **\n“And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.  \nAnd he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her”.   **\nWhat God requires is restitution. This means the marriage should be dissolved, however long it has taken place and whatever number of children are involved. Many people do not know this truth. Some argue against it. But without restitution in this sinful relationship in marriage the Christian cannot make it to heaven. Seek counsel for your case, if you are not clear. Let the man or woman go back to the former partner or remain unmarried. This is practiced by true Christians till today.   **\n\n",

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you.  **\n \n \nAbout the Author   **\nPastor Paul Rika the International Director and Founder of Holiness Revival Ministry Worldwide, aka Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide with headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria. Has been a preacher of Holiness and Righteousness for some decade now. He currently resides at Abuja, Nigeria. From where He directs the affaires of the Movement Worldwide. Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. Horemow is a non-denominational Ministry, given to the propagation of Christ’s Righteousness and Holiness in the Churches and nations of the world, through Crusade, Revival Meetings, Conferences, Production and spreading Holiness Literatures and materials.  **\n\n\nChapter One  **\n The Dressing of the Godly   **\n \nThe Bible says First Timothy 2 verse 9 to 10   **\n  “In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; \nBut (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.”   **\nDressing of the Godly is very important. As a Christian woman, the way you dress matters because the Bible says, without holiness, nobody can see God” Hebrews 12 verse 14. Many believe that God looks inside the heart only.  The lord has covered his face from us because of our sinful life. The way we live our lives, the Lord is not happy with us. The Bible says, for this same emphasis of holiness, holiness of life, the women of old, adorned themselves in modest apparel. Don't dress roughly and don't dress in a shabby way as to bring shame to the name of the Lord. Don’t be dirty.   **\nIn like manner also that women adorn themselves, nice, clean, fine, but in modest apparel, Godly apparel with shame-facedness; covering all parts that no part be exposed to make you ashamed. Cover all parts, all your parts. Don't expose your body. Dress with shame-facedness and sobriety.   **\nHave self-control and sobriety, not with braided hair, fanciful hairdo like harlots or like sinners on the streets. Wanting to sell their bodies. That is defilement of their bodies. Not with braided hair or gold. According to the Bible, they belong to Satan. This gold, pearls, etc. are very costly and the women in those days hung them on themselves to add to their dignitary. These are the things the Lord is pointing out. They are not just normal things of life but they are things that have no meaning. They are for the pride of women. They are for the extra beauty of a woman to make her to cause attraction on men and pollute the society. And this is against Righteousness and Godliness. So these pearls; not with pearls or costly array make high women in the society to desire to dress above others. You want to put on costly dresses to look superior in the society because you want to promote self, look high and wear costly cloth that will make your shoulders very high above women in the society.   **\nYou move the women in the Society to idolize you and you are now the one putting women into problems. They cannot rest at home disturbing their husbands to buy such for them. Some will be saying to their husbands, “if you love me”, “look at this woman, the cloth she is putting on, the wrapper is about 70, 000.00 Naira about 438 dollars, You are the one troubling the church.   **\nYou are causing women to turn away their minds from God and they have turned to you. They will now look at you and want to emulate you so as to also feel important.  \nBut that is not godly emulation and that is not the example the Lord wants you to set. That is not what God wants the people to emulate. Be an example to the believers in words, in conversation, in faith, in charity, in the church of Christ and turn them to God.   **\nThat is where you should be an example. But how should your dressing look like which becometh women professing Godliness? What is the type of dressing and the type of adornment that becometh women that describe a Godly woman? anytime you are seen, will people see Christianity in your life? If your dressing is godly, when you are seen, we will see righteousness and Holiness in your life. We will see the meekness of Christ in your life, the decency of Christ in your life.  \nPeople will see the glory of God in your life. We will see the precious word coming out of a woman that has been cleansed and sanctified for the Lord. That should be your appearance as a Christian woman. In the book of First Peter 4 verse 1 to 5. The Bible says   **\n\"  Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind; for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin; \n That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. \n For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries; \n Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you  \n Who shall give account to him \nthat is ready to judge the quick and the dead.”    **\n Who is the Lord talking to? It is about woman that has an unbelieving husband. This portion of the scripture is addressing women that have unbelieving husbands. But they are Christian women. They are Godly women. Then what is the Lord’s admonition and encouragement to those women that have unbelieving husbands? What is the Lord’s warning to those women that have unbelieving husbands? Have you got an unbeliever as a husband?   **\nThe Bible says, “Wives be in subjection to your own husband, even the unbelieving husband that does not obey the word of God”.  **\nFirst  Peter 3 verse 1 Subject yourself; obey that unbelieving husband that you also without the word of God will be won by your conversation.  \nWithout hearing the word, without having to come to church, without having to read the Bible, by seeing your life, character, your gentleness, the submission of your life, the submission of your body, you’re not being tough for him to control; just by your obedience, by following the word of God; it will prick his heart. He will understand the gospel by your life style. Don’t think that you will win that unbelieving husband by outward dressing. Please, don't think that you will make yourself fanciful just to win your husband.   **\nConsider what the Bible says in Hebrews 1 verse 1 to 3    **\n\" God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, \nHath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; \n Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high ”   **\nGod introduced Jesus in order for us to follow and listen to Him in all angles of our lives. To be born again means dead to Christ. Women, you are dead to Christ. You don't commit sin anymore; you don't behave any how you like. A dead woman in Christ depends on God. No ambition, no sinful conversation and dead to her old self, no desire of the flesh, submits freely to her own husband. Paul understood this and he said, ‘Christ lives in me’. (Galatians 2 verse 20)  Whatever I am doing, it is Christ that is doing it for me. God is looking for good character in women. The way to become great in Christ is submission.   **\nRomans 12 verse 14 to 21   **\n“ Bless them which persecute you  bless, and curse not. \n Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep. \n Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits. \n Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men. \nIf it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. \n Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath  for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. \n Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink  for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. \n Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.\"    **\n Woman, Love that bad man as your husband. Please don't think that you will win your husband –that unbelieving man by your outward dressing. Let me make myself fanciful, I will make myself great, I will make myself flamboyant. I will make myself look good to cause my husband to love me, to cause him to pay attention to me. Paul said No! Don't give yourself to the outward dressing of plaiting the hair. Don’t think you will impress your husband by your hairdo or by the decoration of the hair? By the way you plait your hair? By the way you put something on it? No! Don't do your hair the way the world does. Don’t say i am doing it because of my husband; to please my husband. I \nwant to win my husband. The Bible says, ‘don't do that’. You can win that man only if you are a true Christian woman. Do you have mirror in your house that after dressing you will look over and over before going out? You will only win that man with Godly character, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit only. God will use this Godly character of yours on your husband in Jesus name. take note that it is not your hairdo, not the fanciful hairdo, not the ungodly hairstyle. You may say that your husband is ungodly and you will now use the ungodly hairstyle of the people of the world to win him. No!  \nDon’t think that because other women’s hairs are fanciful, so, you will also do yours like that. No! Not by the outward doing of your hair that you can win that man or the wearing of gold. Now talking about gold, that is what harlots do to attract customers’ attention and why trying to attract your husband with it?. Don’t say I will cause him to love me by putting on gold and looking fanciful, by putting on decorations and make ups. No! that is the wrong way, No, Don’t do it so. It is the ornament of meek and quiet spirit which in the side of God is of great price. That is what the Holy Spirit will use you to do over your husband.    **\n \nChapter Two  The Standard of God cannot Change for Worldliness.   **\n  \nThere are churches that say, if you want to gain your husband, dress like the people of the world, it is then, That your husband’s heart will turn to you. As a result of the erroneous teachings in these days, ladies wear trousers; even married women dress like harlots. Turkey gown, very short and body exposing dresses are now reigning all over. Because such churches teach that it is how the girls in the world dress to win the heart of men, so they dress like that to win their husbands, dressing in the same ungodly way so that you can get your husband.  \nThe Lord says, No! Don't do things the way the world does theirs, because if you think you can win your husband or attract him in such an ungodly way, then you are wasting your time. Don't go into those jewelries as the world puts on, thinking you can get your husband, the word of God says; in like manner like the holy women of old, also First Peter 3 verse 3, Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as braided hair and wearing of gold, jewelry and fine clothes or costly array. (Adornment means- make more attractive, decoration)  \nPutting on of clothes, we must get the Bible language. There is something that we must understand. As you are causing the people to understand the word of God, look at the scripture and see how to lead them to understand the Bible.  \nWe have to see and explain the word in a way people will understand what the scripture is actually telling us as Christians.   **\nIn Nehemiah 8 verse 8.    **\n“So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.”      ** \n Can you see the place of a preacher and teacher? If we leave you to the scripture on dressing many will stumble by them. You will misinterpret and go into error. So, they read from the law of God and explained it well to the understanding of the people. They caused them to understand the reading by interpretation of the readings.   **\nBack to First Peter 3 verse 3 and 4   **\n“ Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; \n But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the \nsight of God of great price.”   **\nSome will look at putting on apparel and say, so you mean we should not put on clothes? You mean we should not plait our hair? Is putting on of apparels bad? Explain well for them to understand. Beloved, scriptures have rejected the wearing of gold.  \nHistory has shown us the source of these things and their defilement. But then, not the plaiting of the hair, it is referring to the ungodly hairdo of a sinful woman on the street that seems to impress men.  \nBible says, married women, Christian women don't copy their style, thinking, you will impress your husband. Talking about decoration, flamboyance, high mindedness, stylish dressing, which the women of the world use to attract customers to themselves. Don't go that way in putting on your clothes because you want to win your husband. Do not go ungodly, don't put clothes that will not glorify God in your life. The whole thing is talking about defilement. Stay away from every form of defilement.  \nFor God is Holy, “As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance ” [First Peter 1 verse 14] But, as he who has called you is Holy, be ye Holy, in all manner of your adornment. In your hair-do, make sure holiness is there, nothing should be borrowed from the world. Nothing copied from the world into your life, because, you want to impress anybody or in the putting of apparel.   **\nMake sure you don't copy from the world’s worldly dresses; the poor dressing, the naked dresses because, you want to affect your husband, you want to win your husband. Don’t say, “If your husband is lusting after women in the world, you will expose for him the body he sees outside in the house so that his lust can be on you” Don't go to this fashion of this lustful world. Who told you that all the men can be lusting on you?  \nHe did not marry you in the house to lust after you so, don't do those things. Don't copy those things from the world but look at it in verse 4 of first peter? Let it be the godly heart, the hidden man of the heart, the hidden character, the hidden person of the heart.  \nBe clothed with the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which in the side of God is of great price. First Peter 3 verse 5 “Whether husbands are believers or not believers,' the old women adorn themselves in Godly manners.”  \nMake sure you avoid every form of worldliness in hairdo, every form of worldliness of jewelry in bodily decoration.  That is how the holy women of old time in doing their hairdo did. They did their hair normal. Any time you plait your hair, based on the principle of professing Godly women, do it in a way that when they see you, they see Christianity.   **\nEnsure that there is nothing dirty, nothing defiling, nothing unholy in your appearance as you want to win people to God by your clothing; nothing but, nice, clean, decent; because our God is a Holy God. That is what the word of God is telling us to do as Christian women. But why is the Lord warning us against this ungodly dressing, because, it comes from Satan. All these things are from Satan. Look at it in Ephesians 2 verse 1 to 3   **\n“And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins; \n Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience  \n Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others”.   **\n  Now in time past we work according to the course of this world. These things (worldliness) are according to this world; according to the prince and power of the air. These things come from Satan, all the hair attachment, Ungodly hair styles(example WEAVON) and Ungodly dresses are the designs of Satan.  The spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience. Satan designed it for them. These ungodly dresses, this body exposing dresses, Satan design them for his children, they are children of disobedience. The Bible says when we were in disobedience, we live according to them, we did our hair like theirs, we were not born-again, we did fashion hairdo, we wore this type of things, we wore gold.  But now, you are a Christian, don't do those things, don't fashion yourself anymore because these are the things people do and the wrath of God comes upon them.    **\n Revelation 17 verse 1 to 6  **\n “ And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters  \nWith whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication. \nSo he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness, and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. \n And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication; \n And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. 6 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus, and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.”  can you see those things the Bible is telling us about, and this is what she dresses herself and also dresses her daughters. She is the mother of harlot to cause the kings of this 'world to commit fornication, to cause the habitation of this world to be drunk with her cup of fornication.”   **\n These things are provided by the devil to promote immorality, to promote fornication. Look at it from Verse 3 to  6 “\n So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness, and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. \n And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication  \nAnd upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH. \n And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus  and when I saw her, I wondered with \ngreat admiration.”    **\ncan you see those things the Bible is telling us about, and this is what she dresses herself and also dresses her daughters. She is the mother of harlot to cause the kings of this world to commit fornication, to cause the habitation of this world to be drunk with her cup of fornication.  \nCan you see her, can you see why these things should be avoided in your life? They come from the mother of harlots, the earrings, the jewelry, the beads, the fanciful hairdo, the coloured dressing. Talking about the wearing of apparels, you see the type of apparels here is not an ordinary clothe, it is the one that promotes immorality. That is what we are talking about.    **\nIt is the type of dressing that promotes immorality that attracts men. That is what the Lord is talking about. Mother of harlots, she introduced these things to this world. The gold, the pearls, and these things that you see women wearing. The earrings, necklace, the beads; all this wearing of trousers and the putting on of rags, the exposing dresses, come from the mother of harlot and the mother of the ABOMINATIONS of the earth, she had drank the blood of the saints, backslidden saints have committed immorality with her. She has caused people in the church, people that are “born-again,” people that have escaped from sin, to fall. Because of her works and her daughters’ works in the church, she has caused believers to commit immorality with her thereby getting herself drunk with their blood. She has killed their faith also.  \nIn one of the churches, Jesus appeared and said that, some men have lost their salvation. He was pointing them out one by one, and if the rapture comes now, they are not going to Heaven because of the daughters of harlot that are in the church, because of the mini-skirts, the tight-fitting skirts, that will not cover the body very well. God does not like it. That exposing cloth, breast exposing cloth, back exposing cloth, and gown that does not pass beyond the knee. They are the uniform of harlotry that the mother of harlots, the demons has given to you and the saints are dying because of them.  \nWhen you want to talk about them, the world will not be happy with you, because they want to have access to the church but we will not keep quiet anymore. I say we will not keep quiet! not in this zone.     **\nNumbers 25 verse 6 to 16    **\n“ And, behold, one of the children of \nIsrael came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. \n And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand; \n And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. \n And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand. \n And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,\n  Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy. \nWherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace  \nAnd he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel. \n Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.  \nAnd the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian. \n And the LORD spake unto \nMoses, saying,…”    **\nMany sisters today are just there to kill the believers, kill the church of Christ, if you don't repent, if you are still like that, your judgment is very soon. Jesus is crying every day because harlots have killed and are killing His saints. If you say you don't care, you will care later in hell. Youths today don't want people to control them; it is the work of devil over you.    **\nNow First Peter 3 verse 3    **\n“ Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;”     **\nWe should understand something. Is there any scripture anywhere that tells us about plaiting the hair that will give us added meaning to this scripture? Is there any scripture that appears somewhere else on apparels that can help us understand the mind of God of what is said here? (Yes). We say that the daughter in-law to Judah put on the apparel, the Clothes of a harlot, of prostitute, then, this wearing of apparel is warning against the dressing of the prostitute.  \nIt is warning against evil dresses which can tempt people into immorality. If you check other portion of the Bible, how the king will array himself, Herod arrayed himself in a royal apparel, in a great apparel. It is talking about the dresses that promote pride. Avoid that. But then, what about wearing of gold? Is there other scripture that tells about gold so we can understand what the mind of God is? From the old and new testament has the issue of gold been warn? Yes.    **\nGenesis 35 verse 1 to 4   **\n\" And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there; and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.  Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments  \n And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. \n And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them \nunder the oak which was by Shechem.”     **\nThis is talking about apparel, which means this apparel the Lord is talking about is the type of garment that you cannot wear when you are dealing with the Lord. Jacob says change your Garment.  \nThe Lord has asked me to come to consecrate to him but, these clothes you are wearing, we cannot serve the Lord with it. Change them, that is what we are saying. Don’t wear them anymore, you cannot serve the Lord with polluted clothes. Instead of people seeing God in you; they will be seeing polluted garments. Don't do that.  \nBe simple. Such dresses do not depict moderation, burn them all. Whether they are short, big, black, white, red, flat ones, they should all be destroyed.  \nNo type is recommended for any Christian woman, for those who want to serve God, no type of ungodly dress is recommended. Remove it completely.    **\nExodus 33 verse 4 to 6   **\n“ And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned  and no man did put on him his ornaments. \nFor the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people,  I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee; therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. \nAnd the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.”    **\nTotal cleansing, stiff-necked people. Remove those things that you put on for your external beauty, they removed them all and they were totally washed. When a baby girl comes out during childbearing, has there ever been any earring on the ear of any?.   **\n \nChapter Three  The Dressing and Modesty of a Christian    **\n \nFirst Peter 1 verse 14 to 17, Colossians 1 verse 28 to 29, Second Corinthians 7 verse 1, Proverbs 7 verse 10   **\n\n The Use of Trousers \n Deuteronomy 22 verse 5   **\n“The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment  for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.”    **\nIt troubles men to see a woman bring her backyard out (to show off her private parts), ask men they will tell you. God said, a woman should not put on what pertains to a man neither should the man put on that which belongs to the woman.    **\nSlip Skirt  opening of back and front of your skirt, as you are walking, there are openings on your skirt exposing you, when you bend down men will look and lust. You are causing them to sin. You are also guilty.     **\nMini Skirt  should not even stop at the kneel or even if it passes it a little is not good. You that defile another man’s holiness, you too are not holy.    **\n \nThe Tight Fitting Skirt  If you are the Godly type who say you don't wear trouser, but yet collects mini or split skirts from Satan, you are the same with the woman who wears trouser. All is the same, you are not safe from hell.    **\n \n \n \nHow Should Our Skirt Be?    **\nYour skirt should be long enough that \"When you sit down, your knees should not be seen. If you expose your body and people see it and lust over you, then you are not going to heaven since, you are hindering people from making heaven. If you think you can close your legs when you sit down with your mini skirt, the devil who gives you that mini skirt will also make you open those legs.  \nEven the choir today are been used by the devil. Churches are dying today because of women. It should not be so. That is why the glory of God is departing from the church. Women will sit with miniskirts and expose secrete parts of their body. Take note women! The first woman brought problem to mankind. May God deliver us from the women. Let every woman check her skirt and make corrections, if you want to go heaven.    **\n \nBody Fitted Cloth  Don't follow them. Women dresses have changed! Your dress should not hold your body like that of the unbelievers. Don't show your breast, back, everything. When some women wear clothes, it is as if the cloth will break. Dress righteously please.     **\n \nShort Sleeve Cloth  don't show your armpit to anybody. Nobody is interested. Short hand cloth should be amended to reach elbow. Short Gown  It is not for a godly woman. Dress well and forget about using handkerchief to cover up some part of the body.    **\n \nDeep Cut Dress  If you display your breast through ungodly dress, you will perish with them. If you follow the world, beware there is a spirit leading them to hell. If you see any sister in any fellowship, place or church, kindly ask her to go and change. Don't keep quiet any more. Numbers 25 verse 6 to 16. Don't seat anyhow in the church or dress anyhow, it may drive some men out of the church, some women especially girls are agents. Don’t be used by the devil.   **\n\nDon’t Dye Your Hair   **\nMatthew 5 verse 36   **\nNeither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.”   **\nRomans 1 verse 25    **\n “Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. \nAmen.” \nHow God’s faithfulness has kept you. Changing your hair is a lie. Perfume is not good to be used by a believer. The source is from the kingdom of Satan. Dogs and cats don't use it because of their odor, why human beings?   **\n Isaiah 3 verse 16 to 24   **\n“ Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet; \nTherefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.  \nIn that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,  \nThe chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, \n The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,  stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty. \n The rings, and nose jewels, \n The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,  The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding \nof sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.”    **\n May God deliver this generation from such bad attitude in \nJesus name. Amen   **\n \nConclusion    **\nTo adorn yourself in modest clothing, avoiding perming, jerry curling(hair styling), use of hair attachment, wool, WEAVON(ungodly hair style), dye, earrings, chains, necklace, bracelets, nose rings, wedding ring, engagement ring, cortex, lip sticks, trousers, bleaching, short gown, short skirts, body hug, and all kinds of seductive dresses and property.   **\nFirst Timothy 2 verse 8 to 10   **\n “ I will therefore that men pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting. \n In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; \n But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.”   **\n First Peter 3 verse 3 to 5    **\n “ Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;\n  But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.\n  For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands ”  God Bless You.  \n \n \n \n\n\n",

Make me hate sin and wickedness. Let me hate to see sin in my life. Let me hate to see sin also in the lives of others. Those that love You hate evil. Lord, I will not allow sin into my life. I desire to get sin out of the lives of others. Divine Father, we honour Jesus. God, when Jesus was on earth you saw perfect righteousness in Him; you saw a perfect work against wickedness in His sacrifice. The anointing you gave Him was above all His fellow mankind, when He was a man with us. That is what you do when you find someone that dedicates himself to You in righteousness and holiness. You exalt such a person, for righteousness honours a man. You anoint him with oil of gladness above his fellows. God, I pledge to be righteous, to serve you in holiness. I pledged to hate sin, to work against sin. Sin has been atoned for through Jesus Christ so that sinners should be saved and purified Lord, be with me in my determination to be holy and blameless before You all the days of my life on earth. Thank You for answering me, in Jesus name.\nThis book is like a road constructed through the Bible for all men who desire to serve God in a true and holy way to follow. It will serve to direct the believers' feet on the way of righteousness, truth and holiness. It offers the sincere disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ   **\n\nWhat to believe in the midst of diverse doctrines in the church.   **\n-\tExamples to follow in the practice of Righteousness and holiness.   **\n-\tWhat to preach as a true and faithful minister who desires to lead people to heaven.  **\nMany people believe that it is not possible to live the holy life, but this book will show you that holiness of life is practically possible in our day as in Bible days. May the Lord use this book to bless your life and ministry and the lives and ministry of others through you, in Jesus Christ's name. Amen   \nThis book will make you know why I have found grace in God's sight.  **\n\nCHAPTER 1    **\nWHY BIBLE SAINTS FOUND GRACE IN GOD’S SIGHT   **\nActs 13 verse 22   **\n“And when He had removed him, He raised up unto them David to be their king, to whom also He gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after Mine own heart, which shall fulfill all My will.”\nI have found… it is not easy even for God to find a man like this. I have found, means I have been looking for him. I searched for him and at last I found him. A man after Mine own heart, means his heart is on Me, and he will do all My pleasure. David was a man dedicated to God in life and service. He was bold and courageous and God put him to use as a vessel of honour.    **\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 19 to 21   **\n“ Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Let everyone \nthat nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.  But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. \nIf a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.’’   **\nThe Bible gives us accounts of men and women that obtained favor before God. The Bible also shows us why some of these people found grace in God's sight. God is the same in nature and attribute from the beginning of His revelation to man until now. There are things that provoke Him to judgment against men and there are things that provoke Him to love and make men obtain grace in His sight. We shall make a brief study of some Bible saints with emphasis on why they obtained grace in the sight of God.   **\n\n1. ENOCH    **\nGenesis 5 verse 21 to 24.     **\n“And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah, And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years. And Enoch walked with God  and he was not; for God took him.”     **\n\nIt is not common, brother. It is not common, sister  how many people were taken up by God like that? There was a reason why Enoch found grace in the sight of God. The Scripture gives it as follows  Enoch walked with God.\nFinding grace in God's sight comes with righteousness. Thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness, therefore, God, thy God had anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.     **\n2. NOAH     **\nGenesis 6 verse 5 to 8.    **\n“And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. \nAnd it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. \n And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. \n But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.”    **\nIt is not common to obtain this special grace that Noah had from the Lord. The grace of God indeed has appeared to all men, but not all men find it, not all men care to find it. Not all men find this special grace Noah found in the eyes of God. Why did Noah find grace in the eyes of the LORD? See what the Scripture says below of Noah     **\n\nGenesis 6 verse 9    **\n“These are the generations of Noah, Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.”    **\nGenesis 7 verse 1    **\n“And the LORD said unto Noah, come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before Me in this generation.’’   **\nWe can see by the Scriptures that Noah found grace in the sight of God because of his righteous and perfect life.     **\n\n. ABRAHAM   **\nAbraham found grace in the sight of the Lord. He obtained a special title and honour, for he was called, The friend of God.   **\nJames 2 verse 23    **\n“And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness  and he was called the Friend of God.”     **\n\nThe Scripture reveals what made Abraham find this special grace in his walk with God.    **\nGenesis 15 verse 5 and 6.     **\n“And He brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them;  and He said unto him, So shall thy seed be. \nAnd he believed in the LORD; and He counted it to him for righteousness.”    **\n Romans 4 verse 19 to 22    **\n“And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb  \nHe staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; \nAnd being fully persuaded that, what He had promised, He was able also to perform. \n And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.”    **\n\nGod no doubt was thrilled by the strong faith Abraham had towards Him. He had found a man to take along with Him in the walk of faith; for without faith it is impossible to please God. Not only was Abraham strong in faith, God was persuaded of Abraham that he would keep his family and household in order, because of the godly activities and exemplary life he displayed before them.   **\nGenesis 18 verse 17 to 19   **\n“And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; \nSeeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? \nFor I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.”    **\n\nKeeping your children and household in the righteousness of God, makes you to find favor in the eyes of God. There is yet another thing that made Abraham win God's favor. It was his uncommon obedience to the commandments of God.   **\n\nGenesis 22 verse 1 to 2,9 to 12,15 to 18.   **\n“And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham  and he said, Behold, here I am And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\nAnd they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. \n And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. \n And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham  and he said, Here am I.\nAnd he said, lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him  for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from Me. \nAnd the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, \nAnd said, By Myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son  17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; \nAnd in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed My voice.”   **\n\nIt is not a mere thing when you see that somebody has found grace in the sight of God. There are some sacrifice and difficult obedience carried out by that man for God. There are some acts of righteousness, dedication, holiness, love of God exercised and practiced by that man that gave him that type of divine favour.   **\n4. JOSEPH   **\nGenesis 39 verse 1 to 6.    **\n“And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither. \nAnd the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. \nAnd his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. \nAnd Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him  and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. 5 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. \n And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured”   **\n\nThe above Scripture shows us the favour Joseph found before his master Potiphar. This was an extension of the grace Joseph had found with God. This favour was following him everywhere he went. The following Scriptures tell us the reason of the favour of God on Joseph's life. Surely Joseph loved righteousness and hated iniquity.    **\nGenesis 37 verse 1 and 2     **\n“And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. \nThese are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives  and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.”    **\n\nGenesis 39 verse 7 to 12    **\n“And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. \nBut he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; \nThere is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife,  how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? 10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph Day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. \nAnd it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. \nAnd she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me  and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.”    **\nWhen you see a man enjoying divine favour in a true sense of it, examine him; get to hear about him, you will see the following in his life  uncommon obedience, uncommon exercise of faith in Christ, uncommon consecration to the LORD, and uncommon acts of righteousness.    **\n\n\nCHAPTER 2    **\nWHY BIBLE SAINTS FOUND GRACE IN GOD’S SIGHT PART 2   **\n5.  MOSES    **\n Numbers 12 verse 1 to 4.    **\n“And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married  for he had married an Ethiopian woman. \nAnd they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it. \n(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.) 4 And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.’’   \n\nNow the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.   **\nCan you see this uncommon humility in Moses? Moses \nfound grace in the sight of God. Humility in his life occasioned that grace that he found in the sight of God.     **\nNumbers 12 verse 5 to 10    **\n“And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam  and they both came forth. \nAnd he said, Hear now My words  If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make Myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream. \nMy servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all Mine house. \nWith him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold, wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?  And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and He departed. \n      And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became      leprous, white as snow and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.”    **\nMoses was a prophet, of course, as Aaron and Miriam. But there was a distinction between Moses and others under him. He was faithful in all matters of shepherding and leadership over the people of God, according to God's declaration. It was like a surprise to God that Aaron and Miriam could speak against a man like Moses. God rebuked them in anger thus  “Why were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses? You think he is like you? You think he is in the same level with you? Do you know his consecration? Do you know his dedication? Do you know how he has raised up himself and how I see him and his commitment to Me? You do not reverence him?”   **\nMiriam suffered God's judgment because of her disrespect for Moses. We can see in this Scripture why Moses obtained grace in the sight of God.    **\n6.   JOB    **\nJob 1 verse 1 to 5    **\n“There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. \nAnd there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. \nHis substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.”   **\n\nJob was upright and perfect in the sight of God. God was well pleased with him and opened up the door of great wealth and prosperity for him and he became the greatest man among the men of the East. Can you see here that the character of a man before God can give him open door to prosperity and progress above his fellows? God boasted of Job to Satan because of his uncommon righteousness and holiness in the earth.   **\nJob 1 verse 8 to 11    **\n“And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?\nThen Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? \nHast not Thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. \nBut put forth Thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse Thee to Thy face.”    **\n\nGod told Satan that there was none on earth that practiced righteousness and holiness as Job. Satan replied God that Job feared Him for the blessings and protection he enjoyed from Him, and that if he would be permitted to temper with Job's blessings, the result would surprise God. God permitted Satan to do so. Then Satan went against Job and destroyed his wealth and riches along with his children. But to his surprise, all these did not affect the righteousness of Job.\nHere is the account of Scripture   **\nJob 1 verse 20 to 22   **\n\t“Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,\n\tAnd said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither  the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.”    **\n\tIn all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.    **\nNow, was God justified for chosen Job, for giving him uncommon prosperity, progress, riches, wealth, honour and promotion? When you give God Uncommon consecration, you receive uncommon grace. This display of righteousness before Satan increased God's boasting over Job     **\nJob 2 verse 3 to 7   **\n“And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered My servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst Me against him, to destroy him without cause. \nAnd Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. \nBut put forth Thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse Thee to Thy face. \nAnd the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life. \nSo went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.”     **\n\nApart from striking Job with sickness, Satan also employed Job's wife to make him turn away from the Lord. But all these did not succeed to turn Job away from the righteousness of God.   **\n\nJob 2 verse 9 and 10    **\n“Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.”    **\nThere are a few men and women who have this consecration of Jobs before the Lord, but you may not know them. The Lord may reveal them by His prophetic word, or by His uncommon blessings upon their lives. It means God may give such one uncommon ministerial calling and anointing. Be careful not to be on the side of unbelief, criticism and insubordination to such anointed of God because of little faults, or hearsay, or a backbiting tongue against them. Job overcame all the Satanic wiles which God allowed to try his faith. He maintained righteousness and total trust in God. Therefore, the Lord doubled his blessings and granted him a ministry among men till this day, though he is dead.    **\n\nJob 27 verse 3 to 6    **\n\t“All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils; \n\tMy lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. \n\tGod forbid that I should justify you  till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me. \n\tMy righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go  my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.”    **\n\nJob 42 verse 12,13,16 and 17   **\n\t“So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. \n\tHe had also seven sons and three daughters. 16 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations. \n So Job died, being old and full of days.”    **\n\n7.   DANIEL    **\nDaniel 1 verse 8.    **\n“But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank  therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.” \nYou can see here Daniel's consecration to God and purity of life. His life style influenced the remaining three Hebrew children Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Their determination to maintain undefiled life carried along with it the risk of their lives. But at the end God highly blessed them.    **\n\nDaniel 1verse 18 to 20     **\n\t“Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before \nNebuchadnezzar. \n\tAnd the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah  therefore stood they before the king. \n\tAnd in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.”    **\nThe righteousness of Daniel was further challenged under the government of Darius. Because of Daniel a decree was made that nobody should pray to any other God except to King Darius for the space of thirty days. The penalty for disobeying this decree was death in the den of the lions. Daniel ignored their threat and maintained his righteousness before God.    **\n\nDaniel 6 verse 10   **\n“ Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.” \nThe great deliverance from the lions that followed Daniel's total trust in God brought great glory and promotion to the name of the Lord.   **\nDaniel 6 verse 25 to 27    **\n\t“Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. \n\tI make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel  for He is the living God, and steadfast forever, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and His dominion shall be even unto the end. \n\tHe delivereth and rescueth, and He worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, Who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.”   **\n\nDaniel found grace in the sight of God who filled him with knowledge, wisdom and understanding. He was greatly beloved of his God because of his righteousness and uncommon faith in God. See the special way the Scripture addressed Daniel    **\n\nDaniel 10 verse 11 and 19   **\n  “And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright, for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling. \n And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not; peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.” \nA man greatly beloved! What an uncommon grace he had found before God for the display of righteousness and holiness in hard places and at difficult times!”    **\n\nCHAPTER 3    **\nWHY BIBLE SAINTS FOUND GRACE IN GOD’S SIGHT PART 3.   **\n MARY THE MOTHER OF JESUS.    **\nLuke 1 verse 26 to 28.     **\n\t“And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, \n\tTo a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. \n\tAnd the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is\nwith thee; blessed art thou among women. Thou that art highly favoured ”   **\nMary was highly favoured by God. She was chosen by God to be the one that would give birth to Christ, the Son of the living God, the Saviour of mankind. What prompted this favour? Surely her righteousness and holiness. She was a virgin who had never known a man, because of the fear of God. The godliness of Mary can be understood by Joseph, the man that was betrothed to her.   **\nMatthew 1 verse 19 to 20  **\n“Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily. \n But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. Joseph was a just man and diligent in righteousness. This showed us how Mary was.”   **\n\n9.  PAUL THE APOSTLE.    **\nApostle Paul was a man that obtained great grace in the sight of God. God gave him abundant revelations concerning the Church of Christ.   **\nSecond Corinthians 12 verse 7    **\n  “And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.”   **\n\nApostle Paul also testified that though he was the least of all the apostles, by the grace of God bestowed upon him, he labored more than them all.   **\n First Corinthians 15 verse 10   **\n  “But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.”   **\nHe wrote fourteen of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. Many reasons account for this grace he found in the sight of God  he was humble, zealous, passionate, yielding to suffering and persecution. Above all these, he was righteous and holy. Hear his testimony      **\nActs 23 verse 1   **\n“And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.”   **\nActs 24 verse16   **\n“And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.”   **\nFirst Thessalonians 2 verse 10   **\n“Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe ”    **\nThe Lord is with the righteous. He bestows His grace for special function and service upon holy men and women.   **\n \nPsalms 18 verse 24   **\n“Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.”   **\nCleanse yourself from sin and be a vessel unto honour unto the Lord for His honourable uses. Stop envying others as Cain did against Abel.    **\n \nGenesis 4 verse 3 to 7   **\n\t“And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.\n\tAnd Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering  \n\tBut unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. \n\tAnd the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? \n\tIf thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.”    **\n 10.\tTHE MAN CHRIST JESUS   **\nHebrews 1 verse 8 and 9    **\n\t“But unto the Son He saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever  a sceptre of righteousness is the scepter of Thy kingdom. \n\tThou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of gladness above Thy fellows.”  **\n\nThis Scripture shows that Jesus Christ is Eternal God and One with the Father. He was the Word made flesh that dwelt among us.   **\nJohn 1 verse 1 and 14    **\n“ In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  \n And the Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth”.\n\nGod anointed Him with oil of gladness above His fellows, because He loved righteousness and hated iniquity. Listen to what Jesus Himself said   **\nJohn 15 verse 10    **\n“If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love; even as I have kept My Father's commandments, and abide in His love.”     **\nJohn 8 verse 29    **\n“And He that sent Me is with Me  the Father hath not left Me alone; for I do always those things that please Him.”    **\n\nJesus said that the reason why He abode in the Father's love was because He kept His commandments and did always those things that pleased Him.\nGod gave the man Jesus the greatest name in the universe because of His complete obedience to the Father.   **\nPhilippians 2 verse 5 to 11  **\n\t“Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus  \n\tWho, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God  \n\tBut made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a se\n\tAnd being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. \n\tWherefore God also hath highly exalted Him, and given Him a Name which is above every Name  \n\tThat at the Name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; 11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”   **\nThe name Jesus was given to Him because of His righteousness and acts of obedience before God.   **\nThe Gifts And Calling Of God\nAre the gifts and calling of God not by grace and His foreknowledge? Does man need to play any role for them? Yes, but grace is received by faith and is established by works.\nEphesians 2 verse 8 and 9   **\n“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God;\nNot of works, lest any man should boast.”\n\nIf God has called or chosen anyone, either from birth, or by prophecy, or by other divine way to use and achieve His purpose, if that has to do with His children, the work of righteousness is required to establish such gift and calling.   **\nJames 2 verse 20 to 22    **\n\t“But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?\n\tWas not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar? \n\tSeest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?”   **\nGenesis 18 verse 17 to 19.   **\n\t“And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; \n\tSeeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? \n\tFor I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him.”  **\nJeremiah 18 verse 9 and 10    **\n\t“And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; \n\tIf it do evil in My sight, that it obey not My voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.”   **\n\n First Samuel 13 verse 13 and 14    **\n “And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which He commanded thee; for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. \n But now thy kingdom shall not continue, the LORD hath sought Him a man after His own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain over His people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD commanded thee.”    **\nThe above Scriptures and many of their kinds will suffice in this respect.   **\n\n\nCHAPTER 4   **\nTHE CALLING AND MINISTRY OF PASTOR PAUL RIKA   **\n\nI Pastor Paul Rika have obtained grace in the sight of God to be given the leadership of this great and special end time ministry, Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. The Lord has spoken in diverse ways and times that this ministry is His own, that He is the Divine founder and that I am His human representative. Holiness Revival Movement is Non-Denominational and seeks to bring all Churches of Christ on earth to the unity of faith and to revive Biblical Righteousness and Holiness among believers. I will confess like Paul the Apostle according the following Scriptures   **\nFirst Thessalonians 2 verse 10   **\n“Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe”  **\nNow, I have brought all these to you to say, “I, Pastor Paul Rika, have kept myself and family in God's love and purity. Being confident in this that no man on earth can truly give account of sin and rebellion against God and against the Holy Scripture in my life. I am very confident that nobody anywhere can rise up and truly say, “Pastor Rika, you did this evil, I found you committing this or that sin”; yet you claim to be a child of God, a man of God.”, Nobody.   **\n\nMy Work With The Government    **\nI worked with the government of my state as an Accountant for about five years. I withdrew my service because of God's call to Christian ministry. My conscience has no record of lie, fraud or any offence against the government that brought blasphemy against the name of the Lord and disproved my Christian claim.   **\n\nRomans 9 verse 1.    **\n“I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,”    **\n\nReasons For This Testimony   **\nReason 1, I indeed have found grace in the sight of God to lead this End Time Ministry, Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. I want people to know that this is purely the work of divine mercy, grace and choice. This is a spiritual calling and is void of human wisdom, politicking and struggle.   **\nEphesians 3 verse 7 to 8.   **\n“Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of His power. \n Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;”    **\nReason 2, 1 have seen that many people have dedicated themselves to Satan to be used by him against me in all manner of criticism, slander, blackmail and abuse. Some of these people are ignorant of what they are doing, while others do it purposely. By this testimony, I hope to open their eyes to the error of their ways.    **\nLuke 23 verse 34   **\n  “Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted His raiment, and cast lots.”   **\nReason 4, Because these traitors have said all manner of things through the social media against me and Holiness Revival Movement, they have caused many to stumble in the faith and several people have hardened their hearts to the message and revelation that God gives through this End Time Holiness Movement. Some are already turned aside from this Movement because of what they have heard. By this personal testimony, I hope to recover such ones back to faith in Christ and to the life of righteousness and holiness required for heaven.   **\n\nGalatians 2 verse 4 and 5   **\n\t“And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;\n\tTo whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.”   **\n Second Timothy 2 verse 25 and 26   **\n “In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; \n And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.”   **\n\nReason 4, This personal testimony is meant to provide answers to the questions that are in the hearts of many concerning myself, Pastor Paul Rika, and Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. They shall know the truth and be made free.   **\nJohn 8 verse 32   **\nAnd ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.    **\nReason 5, This personal testimony is meant to cause those who love God and His word of truth, righteousness and holiness, His faithful servant and the Holiness Ministry to resist evil workers and pray against their works in this end time.   **\nMatthew 7 verse 15 and 17   **\n\t“Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. \n\tYe shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? \n Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.”    **\n \nSecond Corinthians 11 verse 13 to 15    **\n\t“For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. \n\tAnd no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. \n Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.”   **\n\nSecond Thessalonians 3 verse 1 to 3   **\n\t“Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you  \n\tAnd that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men; for all men have not faith. \n\tBut the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil.”  **\n\nReason 6, By this personal testimony, I present myself as an example to others to emulate in the Ministry of Truth, Righteousness and Holiness.   **\n \n First Timothy 4 verse 12   **\nLet no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.   **\n First Corinthians 11 verse 1    **\n“Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.”    **\nReason 7, The Devil desires to cover the glory of God with darkness so men may not see His presence and active works among us His true servants. By this personal testimony, this darkness is removed that men and women all over the world may see God's presence and active works in Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. By so seeing they may turn to the Lord for their salvation and align with the teaching of the Movement which are based on biblical truth, righteousness and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.   **\nIsaiah 60 verse1 to 5   **\n“ Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.  For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people  but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee. \n\tAnd the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thy rising. \n\tLift up thine eyes round about, and see  all they gather themselves together, they come to thee  thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side. \n\tThen thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee”.     **\nReason 8, The truth revealed by this personal account, testify against this evil workers that they have left the Lord Jesus Christ and are employed by the devil to fight Christ and His children, and so must repent or face His eternal Judgment.   **\n Second Peter 2 verse 1 to 3    **\n“But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. \nAnd many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. \nAnd through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you  whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.”   **\n\nReason 9, By this testimony, you will know that nothing is new upon the earth. The way Jesus and the Apostles were challenged and persecuted in bible times, is the same way we are persecuted today. \nThe issue of consideration is not the persecution but our attitude towards it. By the grace of God we have conducted ourselves according to the Scriptures towards people and their evil works.    **\nMatthew 5 verse 10 to 12   **\n\t“Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. \n\tBlessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. \n\tRejoice, and be exceeding glad  for great is your reward in heaven  for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.”    **\n \n Second Timothy 3 verse 12    **\n“Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.”    **\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5    **\nMY MEMBERSHIP AND MINISTRY IN DEEPER LIFE BIBLE CHURCH    **\nI became a member of Deeper Life Bible Church in 1983, when I was twenty one years old, having just completed my secondary education. I got restored to faith, having been born again sometime back in 1977. In Deeper Life, I learned much about God and His holiness and got sanctified and baptized with the Holy Spirit. I was zealous and committed to God and to righteous living. I hungered and thirsted after God and His fullness and desired to serve Him in full time capacity, except for my academic pursuit. For the period of twenty six years I had the grace to serve the Lord from the lowest to the highest position or rank under the leadership of the General Superintending; Pastor W. F. Kumuyi.\nI served as  House Leader, Zonal Leader, Location Pastor, District Coordinator, Campus General Coordinator, Regional Overseer (A Pastor in charge of Deeper Life Churches in two or more Local governments in a state).\nState Overseer (A Pastor in charge of Deeper Life Churches in a State in Nigeria).\nNational Overseer (A Pastor in Charge of Deeper Life Churches in a country outside Nigeria). My ministerial Service in Deeper Life began in 1983 until 2009.\nThe following Scriptures speak well of my service in Deeper Life Bible Church    **\n First Corinthians 4 verse 1 and 2   **\n“Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. \nMoreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.”   **\n \n Second Corinthians 4 verse 1 and 2    **\n\t“Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;\n\tBut have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God”     **\nSecond Corinthians 4 verse 1 and 2    **\n\t“Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not; \n\tBut have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.”     **\nI served as a Pastor in five different states in Nigeria and one other country besides Nigeria. In my twenty six years of Christian Ministry within the Deeper Life, my conscience bears me witness I was righteous and holy both in life and ministry. I was never at any time found in sin both in private and in secret, God bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.\nNone of the members and workers of the churches I pastured, man or woman, for the twenty six years in Deeper Life, can rightly accuse me of sin against God, in private or public. I worked among Pastors and Overseers. I speak with the same confidence that none of them can rightly say, “Pastor Paul Rika is not a minister of righteousness”. This is the lifestyle I have continued in to this day of writing, as one who has found favour to be the Int'l Director of Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, after about nine years of leaving Deeper Life Bible Church by the will of God.    **\nActs 26 verse 22 and 23     **\n“Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come  \n\tThat Christ should suffer, and that He should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.”    **\n\n\nMy Ministerial Relationship With Michael Thomas Sambo   **\nMichael Sambo is a young man that found grace in the sight of God to be used in a peculiar way in this end time. Both of us are Kuteb by tribe from Taraba State, Nigeria. He was born in 1981 in Bika, Takum Local government area, Taraba State, which was two years before I began The Holy Life & Ministry of a True Preacher 44 the Christian Ministry in Deeper Life Bible Church. He became a member of Deeper Life Bible Church later in life, along with his parents. In 2003 during the Youth Retreat of Deeper Life Bible Church, he received the visitation of the Lord Jesus Christ, who took his spirit through death experience to Heaven and to Hell and showed him Scriptural realities. The Lord sent him back to the earth with special message to the Church and to the world. This was during his second year in the university. Although we are from the same area and I know his father, I did not know him then.  **\nDeeper Life Attitude Towards Divine Revelations   **\nThe divine revelation experience of Michael Sambo was received with fear by leaders and members of Deeper Life Bible Church, because of the unfavorable attitude of the General Superintendent of the Ministry, Pastor W.F. Kumuyi, towards dreams, prophecies and revelations in the church. When a leader reported the revelation incident of Michael Sambo and the message perpetrated by it, he frowned at it and demanded that the cassettes be retrieved from church members and destroyed. By the grace of God a minister friend of mine in Deeper Life gave me the cassettes of the revelation message. When I listened to them, I saw that the revelation message was from God and was vital for the church of Christ and the inhabitants of the earth. I took the risk of circulating the revelation message within and outside Deeper Life Bible Church. Later, God led me to put the revelation message into a book which I titled    **\nDIVINE REVELATION OF GOD'S HOLINESS AND JUDGEMENT. I contacted some Overseers Michael Sambo served under, to take him to the General \nSuperintendent to be interviewed by him face to face if it might help to convince him of the divinity of the experience, but they objected due to fear of the suspected reaction they might receive from him. When the relevant Overseers objected, I decided, being an overseer myself, to take Michael Sambo to the General Superintendent, Pastor WF Kumuyi. I spiral bounded the copy of the revelation message for his perusal.  A copy was given to him through his wife, and another copy was given to the church Secretary. I did this because, I thought by his personal interaction with Michael Sambo and reading the revelation message, he might believe that God was involved in it and would allow it to spread freely. However, when we met with him and I introduced Michael Sambo and the revelation he had received from the Lord Jesus Christ, he was skeptical and said, when Lazarus was raised from dead he did not come with revelation message of what he saw or heard. He, however, said he would read the revelation message we had submitted to him and told Michael Sambo to continue with his study and not to leave school because of revelation message. When I returned from my mission country about a year after, having completed the book for printing, I met with him and enquired whether he had read the copy I gave him. At this time he openly declared “We preach the Bible and not revelation encounter. Tell him to stop it.” At this point I ceased from planning to publish the book. This was in January 2008.    **\nHow the Book Was Published Eventually   **\nWithin the month, my late wife Sis Edna Rika was diagnosed of cancer and we were directed to University of Ibadan Teaching Hospital for the treatment.  We were accommodated in one of the mission buildings of Deeper Life Bible Church, Ibadan. In the course of my prayer with my late wife, we agreed to give a sum of money to God. By the guidance of God, this money was used to make photocopy of Christ's revelation to seven Columbian youths and the manuscript of the book, Divine Revelation of God's Holiness and Judgment to distribute freely to people. The testimonies received were great especially on Divine Revelation of God's Holiness and Judgment. God began to deal with me to print the book. I expressed fear of doing so because of the church leadership opposition to it. But He told me to 47 go ahead, that He would be with me. Being encouraged, I got the book published. The book did great work for God in the Country Nigeria and outside it. The eyes of many were opened to Biblical truth, Righteousness and holiness required for heaven.    **\n\n\nCHAPTER 6    **\nTHE CHALLENGE I FACED IN DEEPER LIFE BIBLE CHURCH   **\nAt this time, great persecution arose against me in Deeper Life Bible Church. A committee of four state Overseers was setup to question me on the publication of the book. A few days after, I was brought before the state and national Overseers of the ministry, the top Pastors, to be questioned on the publication of the book. When they asked me why I published the book, I told them, “The Lord Jesus came to the Easter Retreat of Deeper Life Bible Church Takum, Taraba State, with two of His angels, in a divine revelation and took Michael Thomas Sambo, in a death experience, to heaven and to hell and gave him message to humanity. But I noticed that the members of the Deeper Life were afraid to hear him because of the uncertain reaction of the General Superintendent. Being fully informed about the incidence and convinced about the divinity of the message, I contacted some relevant Overseers to take Michael Sambo to the General Superintendent so that he too could hear and verify the incident. But they were afraid. As a result, I took it upon me, not being the direct overseer over Michael Sambo, but just because we are from the same place, to take him to the General Superintendent. The superintendent showed skepticism over the matter. You are all aware of my wife's sick condition and my present state. My wife and I agreed to give God a sum of money as a seed of faith; the Lord led me to use the money to make photocopies of the manuscript of the book for free distribution. And He further led me to publish this book. When I objected due to fear of church authority, He told me to go ahead saying that He would be with me. That was why I published the book. The book is doing a lot  converting souls, restoring backsliders and turning churches to Biblical Truth, Righteousness and Holiness.” I am sure I was addressing above forty Overseers, most of whom were my seniors in the faith and Christian service. They asked further, “Can God asked you to publish that book without first telling the General Superintendent about it?” I was amazed by that question. I answered, '' We are all ministers of God seated here and have the Holy Spirit in us and the word of God, the Bible, before us. I want to ask this question  Is it true that God cannot use us to do something for Him, except He first tells the General Superintendent about it?” At this juncture, there was uproar. Some looked at me as being stubborn, while others looked at it differently. The following day I was conducted to the General Superintendent who made the following pronouncement on me \n“I thought when I allowed you to stand before your colleagues, you would fall down, crying and pleading for mercy, asking for opportunity to be given you to go round the bookshops and where ever the books are to gather them and burn them. But I am seeing that you are still standing on your conviction, saying that you would obey God rather than man? That scripture was used to unbelieving Sanhedrin. Would you quote that scripture for me in this matter? Now I stop you from being an overseer, a preacher, a leader and a worker in Deeper Life. As to whether you will ever come back…depends on what you have done on this book and you are on discipline. Your salary is henceforth stopped”\nI left his office confused as to what the next thing was. I was very sorrowful and afraid of leaving Deeper Life Bible Church. But the Lord said to me, Eternal life is not Kumuyi or Deeper Life, but Myself. Before Kumuyi was or Deeper Life was founded, people went to heaven. The issue is being where I want you to be and doing My will, that is eternal life. This greatly comforted me.    **\n\nI Lost My First Wife    **\nMy sick wife later died, April that year, 2009, and by the instruction of the General Superintendent, the overseers of the north Eastern states of Nigeria should take charge of the burial, which took place in my village, SabongidaLissam, Ussa Local Government, Taraba State. I returned to the General Superintendent to show appreciation for the kindness I received for the burial of my wife and reported that it was done successfully. After this, I went back to Ibadan and remained in the accommodation in the church premises; I met with the Overseer in charge and asked him to help me tell the General Superintendent that since I have not received any instruction from him, I have returned back to Ibadan to remained in the church premises. He later told me he contacted the General Superintendent who said, “Tell Pastor Paul Rika to go round and gather the books from everywhere they are, as I told him. Not to do so shows he is not under my authority.”  When I was told this, at first it did not troubled me. But after sometimes I began to reason within me, “Is it not risky to my eternal soul to be in contention with an anointed man of God in the person of W.F. Kumuyi?” I decided therefore to stop the publishing of the book. I drafted a letter which was to be sent to the publisher instructing him to stop the publishing of the book.  It was my plan that after I had sent the letter to the publisher, I would go with a copy to show the General Superintendent the action I had taken concerning the book. But after drafting the letter I sat down to read the Scripture. The Lord gave me    **\nActs 19 verse 36    **\n“Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.”\nHe told me never to withdraw from publishing the book. He said, “Pastor W.F. Kumuyi or Deeper Life Bible Church can never prove through the Scriptures that this revelation message is not from Me. Remain quiet and wait for the next action.” I knew the voice of the Lord and submitted to it.  **\n\nMy Letter of Withdrawal of Service   **\nThe Lord spoke many times and in many different ways to strengthen me in this matter. About three months after the Lord spoke to me in a revelation saying What are you waiting for in Deeper Life Bible Church? Do you think that the Deeper Life authority would come later to accept this revelation book? Or are you thinking to submit the book to be burned as you were instructed?  Arise and leave the Deeper Life Bible Church  the world is waiting for you.\nBeing enlightened and strengthened by these words I put in my withdrawal letter from full time service with Deeper Life Bible Church, in July 2009, with one month notice. In the letter I stated that my service with the Deeper Life would be considered ended after the one month notice. I wrote this letter with apprehension, wondering whether I was still considered a minister in Deeper Life or I had been dismissed by the pronouncement of the General Superintendent. My letter did not receive any reply as I envisaged. After the one month notice expired, I began ministering under Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide which has continued till today.   **\n\nCancellation of Church Discipline    **\nIn October 2010, the General Superintendent, Pastor W.F. Kumuyi, announced via public media that all those he had placed on discipline had been released and that those who had left Deeper Life Church could return, if they wanted to, and that those who wanted to continue in their ministry should do so but should see themselves released from whatever discipline was upon them by the General Superintendent. It is a well known case to members of Deeper Life Bible Church that church discipline inflicted on member may not really be that the member has sinned against God. Transgression against denominational rule can lead to discipline and yet may not be sin against God. The church discipline imposed upon me was not because I sinned against God, but against denominational tradition which has no Biblical basis. It became a way by which God removed me from Deeper Life Bible Church to begin a new work for Him in Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, according to His end time plan. Pastor Kumuyi’s action has remained a stumbling block to many Deeper Life members today who have willfully excluded themselves from the work of God's grace through divine revelation and the ministry I have received from Him. This issue is beyond my ability to handle, God shall handle it Himself.     **\n\n  What Jesus Said to Michael Thomas Sambo   **\nFrom the above narration you have understood how I came across Michael Thomas Sambo and how I laboured over him in the Lord. In his third visit to heaven, Jesus told him He was going to direct him to a man that would direct him, and would spread his revelation message to the ends of the earth. The Lord told him that man is Pastor Paul Rika. The Lord gave him the vision of the Non-denominational Movement, Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide and showed him the leader of the Movement, the Int'l Director, Pastor Paul Rika. According to Michael Thomas Sambo as he related it to me, he asked the Lord, “You have shown me that Pastor Paul Rika is the leader of Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, what do You have for me?” The Lord answered him, “I have brought you to a mentor, follow him. You don't have the ministry but he has the ministry. You have the revelation message. You will use the platform of his ministry to spread the revelation message. \nSince the Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide 55 began August 2009, Michael Sambo had been ministering under this movement.  We went together to many of the places he received invitation to share his testimony. He is a son in the Lord to me and I am father in the Lord to him, who has been in ministry two years after his birth. I applied the grace and wisdom of God in me to direct him on how to share his revelation. Many of the invitations received by Michael Sambo came as a result of reading the book I have written concerning his divine revelation experience titled  DIVINE REVELATION OF GOD'S HOLINESS AND JUDGEMENT  An Account of three Supernatural visits to Heaven and Hell. I was humble in dealing with Michael Sambo and patient with his misconducts.   **\n\n\nCHAPTER 7   **\nMY DOCTRINAL CONVICTION PART 1    **\nI preached sound doctrine and give biblical interpretations to scriptures, according to my training and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.    **\n First Timothy 4 verse 15 and 16   **\n“Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all. \n\tTake heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them  for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.”    **\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 2    **\n “ And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.”    **\n\nTitus 2 verse 1,7 and 8    **\n“ But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine \nIn all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works; in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, \nSound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.”   **\n\nThe following are my doctrinal convictions and what I preach according to the Holy Scripture   **\n1)\tThe Holy Bible   **\nThe Holy Bible is the word of God, inspired for mankind, with final authority on all issues of life  personal, family, government and society.     **\n2)\tThe Trinity   **\nGod exists in three separate Persons  the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ) and the Holy Spirit. These three separate persons exist together through all eternity as One God, who is the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Eternal, Almighty God First John 5 verse 7; Matthew 28 verse 19; Mark 12 verse 29. God made man a tripartite person; Body, Soul and Spirit, according to His likeness. Man is three separate persons in one and one person in three in the likeness of the eternal God, Genesis 1 verse 26 and 27.   **\n3)\tThe Humanity of Jesus\nJesus is God who made Himself a human being and was born as a child by a woman, a virgin, who had never slept with any man from her birth. Luke 1 verse 30 to 35, Matthew 1 verse 21 to23 Isaiah 9 verse 6, Philippians 2 verse 5 to 7.   **\n4)\tJesus The Only Saviour of Mankind   **\nJesus came into this world as God's Son for the purpose of saving humanity from sin, Satan, eternal death, and all evils, and to grant them eternal life and divine blessings, according to scriptures. These were achieved through His suffering, death and resurrection from the dead, John 3 verse 14 to 16 , Luke 2 verse 10 to 12 ,Hebrews 2 verse 9 to 15, Romans 8 verse 32. He is the only Saviour of mankind in the whole world. No man, no prophet, or religion can save man from sin, Satan, and eternal death in this world, except Jesus Christ. Acts 4  verse 12; John 14 verse 6; John 8 verse 12; 10 verse 10.    **\n5)\tThe Sinfulness of all Men    **\nEvery man that is born into this world was conceived in sin and born into sin. Firstly, because he is a descendant of Adam and inherited the blood that was defiled with his original sin. Secondly, because he goes into personal sinful practice from his childhood, Psalm 51 verse 5; Romans 3 verse 23.    **\n6)\tSalvation from Sin    **\nSalvation from sin is the supernatural experience performed in a sinner who has believed in Jesus and has accepted to follow Jesus with all his heart. By this experience the Holy Spirit, by means of God's word and Christ blood, performs wonder in his heart and life, turning him from sin to righteousness, from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God. This real \nexperience is also called, (i) New creature,  Second Corinthians 5 verse 17.   **\n(ii)\tForgiveness of sins, Titus 3 verse 5.  **\n(iii)\tRegeneration, Titus 3 verse 5.   **\n(iv)\tReconciliation with God, Colossians 1 verse 21 and 22.   **\n(v)\tRedemption, Galatians 4 verse 4 and 5.   **\n(Vi) Adoption, Romans 8 verse 15    **\nSalvation from sin is a gift of grace in Christ for all who genuinely repent of their sins and accept the Lord Jesus Christ into their lives, Acts 20 verse 20.   **\n7)\tWater Baptism   **\nWater baptism is a rite commanded to be carried out on all who have repented and believed on the Lord Jesus Christ. This must be done without delay, Mark 16 verse 15 and 16; Acts 8 verse 36 to 38. Those who have become converted to Christ and have all the privilege to be baptized in water, but play carelessness at it are into disobedience and sin. Ministers of the gospel must be prompt at baptizing their converts in water. Water baptism is not for sinners or infants, but for those that have heard the gospel and have repented of their sins and have responded to faith on the Lord Jesus, Acts 2 verse 37 and 39. Biblical water baptism is one emersion into the body of water in the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is the baptism formula carried out by the Apostles in Acts the Apostles. The phrase Baptism in the name of JESUS means baptism as authorized, instructed or commanded by Jesus to differentiate it from the baptism of  John and the one the Pharisees did on their converts , Acts 19 verse 3 to 5; Matthew 23 verse 15.    **\n8)  Sanctification Experience   **\nSanctification is a biblical word that conveys two meanings in the Bible. The first meaning is separation, dedication, set apart to God for holy use. In this respect persons, things, and places can be sanctified or set apart unto God. In this respect Jesus was sanctified by God the Father for human salvation and Jesus sanctified Himself for the holiness of the believers, John 17 verse 19.\nThe second biblical meaning of the word sanctification reveals sanctification as a second definite Christian experience required in a believers heart by which the Holy Spirit by means of Christ's word and His blood renders the believer purified from inherited sin, original sin, inbred sin that often weighs down the heart of a believer. This manifests in the sinful pollution of pride, envy, greed, malice, anger and the likes. Sanctification experience is required to clear such from the heart and life of the believer in order to make him free and give him the gracious ability to exhibit the increasing holy life. Simply put, salvation experience does in a sinner what water and detergent do to a dirty clothe. Sanctification experience does to a believer what rinsing does over washed clothe. Both are separate experiences, but required for wholesome cleansing. As the sinner exercises faith and prays to Jesus Christ for his salvation from sin, the believers \ncome to Christ in faith and pray to receive sanctification and purity of heart and life, John 17 verse 14 to 20; Ephesians 5 verse 24 to 27; Acts 26 to 18. Sanctification also means purity, holiness and heart circumcision.  **\n9) Holy Ghost Baptism   **\nBaptism of the Holy Ghost is the imparting of the power of the Holy Spirit in baptismal measure upon a believer in Christ. This experience imparts on the believer power for effective Christian service. Speaking in tongues by the believer is an un-debatable evidence that one has been baptized with the Holy Spirit. The gifts of the Holy Spirit are valid till today. These are specified in Luke 24 verse 48 and 49; Acts 1 verse 4,5 and 8; First Corinthians 12 verse 7 to 11. However, baptism with the Holy Ghost is not condition for heaven. What qualifies for heaven is holiness.   **\n10)  Healing, Deliverance, Prosperity and Miracles   **\nThe word of God is the word of healing, deliverance and miracles Psalms 107 verse 20 The name of Jesus heals the sick and delivers the oppressed from evil spirits. Believers are commanded to use the name of Jesus in prayer for healing, deliverance, prosperity and miracles for themselves and for others in need, Mark 16 verse 17 and18. Healing, deliverance and miracles are valid today, because Jesus is alive in the Church and in the world Hebrews 13 verse 8. We receive healing through faith and prayer according to God's word of promise. Healing and miracles are part of the gifts of the Holy Spirit given to some believers in the church to bless God's people, first Corinthians 12 verse7 to 10.    **\nUse of Medicines    **\nThe use of medicines and medical practitioners, be it conventional or herbal, is not contrary to God's word. What is evil is consulting with familiar spirits for protection, healing and deliverance. When curative medicines are used in faith, righteousness and prayers to God, the sick can be cured, abnormal conditions can become normal, Luke 5 verse 31 Ezekiel 47 verse 12.   **\nHealing and Miracles Through Physical Substances    **\nIn scripture, God performed some unique miracles in a peculiar way. A few of these include Prophet Elijah parted the river Jordan and crossed over and Elisha did the same shortly afterward. Jesus turned water into wine. The shadow of Peter healed the sick. Handkerchiefs and aprons taken from Apostle Paul healed the sick and cast out devils. These kinds of miracles were not common place among the people. So they are not practiced repeatedly among God's people. God does not allow it so. There are common miracles that we may seek for ourselves and others and for the glory of God by use of the word of God, the name of Jesus and the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The common use of handkerchiefs, aprons, sand, salt, water or what is called “mantles” today for miracles in the church is not of the Holy Spirit. It is introduced by the enemy of the cross to divert the faith of men from Jesus to substances. This is witchcraft in the church, Galatians 3 verse 1. By turning away the faith of believers to these mantles, they are made to serve idols. The practice today by many preachers that turns the faith of people to handkerchief, aprons, salt, sands, water and other substances for healing and miracles is condemned as witchcraft over the people whose faith in Christ Jesus is subverted to their doom, Galatians 3 verse 1. \nA study of scripture shows that miracles by the use of these are very rare and are not standards for preachers to practice and raise the faith of people to seek to have them repeated over in their lives. Faith in Jesus alone is the standard. The use of anointing oil was strictly restricted to the sick and is not mandatory. Many people in apostolic days were healed without the use  of anointing oil. The use of anointing oil was not that rampant in the New Testament era. Hence there is no place in the New Testament for anointing ministers or church members, business premises, church buildings and equipment with oil, Galatians 1 verse 6 to 8.\nIt is the will of God that believers should prosper materially as they prosper in health, Third John verse 2; Job 36 verse 11  **\n\n\nCHAPTER 8   **\n    MY DOCTRINAL CONVICTION PART 2   *\n11)\tMarriage   **\nMarriage is an institution established by God Himself. The Scripture describes marriage as a union between a man and woman who have been joined to each other, having obtained the woman's parental consent and settled required parental demands, Mark 10 verse 6 to 9. God is interested in the marriage of His children and commands believers in Christ never to marry unbelievers, Deuteronomy 7 verse 3 and 4;  Second Corinthians 6 verse 14.\nWedding ceremony can be conducted as required in believers' marriage, but is not what determines marriage. Believers' marriage ceremony must be void of all ungodliness, worldliness and sin in dressing and ceremonial activities. Marriage test should be done to avoid transfer of deadly diseases. Biblical marriage is a union between a man (who has never married before or whose wife is dead) and a woman (who has never married before or whose husband is dead), Luke 16 18. Monogamy is the standard. Polygamy is scripturally condemned. Adultery cannot cause divorce and remarriage, but fornication, Matthew 19 verse 9; John 8 verse 3 to 5 and 7.A man who is in a marriage union with some body's wife is committing fornication. Repentance will require separation or divorce from her. He is free to marry another woman. The same thing applies to a woman who is married to another woman's husband.   **\n12)\t Restitution   **\nRestitution is the scriptural practice of correcting one's past wrong doing against God and man, according to abounding scriptural examples. This practice is required to free the believer from the accusation of men and of personal conscience so that he can serve God in peace and confidence,   **\nEcclesiastes 3 verse 15   **\n“That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.”    **\nFirst Samuel 12 verse 2 to 4   **\n“\tAnd now, behold, the king walketh before you  and I am old and gray headed; and, behold, my sons are with you  and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day. \n\tBehold, here I am  witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed  whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you. \n\tAnd they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.”    **\nActs 24 verse 16    **\n“And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.”\nRestitution involves confessing hidden crime, lies told, treachery practiced against others and rendering apology. The believer is to forgive others and seek forgiveness from those he has offended. Restitution involves restoring stolen or fraudulent money, certificates, documents or property, making confession to appropriate person and apologising for wrong acts, with the willingness to bear the cost or penalty for such crime. Husbands and wives need to make confession of marital unfaithfulness and sin committed against each other in open or secret, James 5 verse 16. \nRestitution is required in wrong marriage. Scripturally wrong marriage must be dissolved; such as second or third marriage, marriage to anyone other than your first lawful partner, Genesis 20 versev3 and 7. Marriage without parental consent and release of their daughter to her husband must be dissolved or the couple must do all that is required for the marriage to be acceptable before God by settling with the parents of the woman. This is known as restitution.\nRestitution is making right the wrong you have done and is a commandment of the Lord to be obeyed. Not to do it is a sin and no sinner shall inherit eternal life, Ezekiel 33 verse 14 to 16. We understand in Scripture that parental consent is required for the woman to leave for marriage, First Corinthians 7 verse 38. The Scripture does not specify that the consent of the man's parent is required to make his marriage to his wife authentic. Hence, no man should separate from his scripturally binding wife because of the attitude of his parent. However his parents may advice him on his marital affairs which he may accept or reject, Genesis 28 verse 1 to 9.    **\n13) Evangelism and the great commission      **\nIt is required of all believers to engage in evangelism and soul winning. The Lord expects all His children to be fruitful, not only in the Christian fruit of righteousness and holiness, but also in the fruit of evangelism and soul winning, Mark 16 verse 15 to18; John 15 verse 8 and 16. Believers are to avail themselves to supply the resources required for effective soul winning, sponsor preachers, produce materials for soul winning, pray earnestly for the salvation of sinners and the preservation of saints. \nComponents of the great commission are Evangelism, Truth, and Holiness, Matthew 28 verse 19and 20. Apart from going out to make disciples for Jesus Christ, we must ensure that believers are taught the truth penned down in scripture. It is the knowledge of biblical truth that produces righteousness and true holiness required for heaven, John 8 verse 30 to 32; Colossians 1 verse 28 and 29. The knowledge of truth gives freedom from satanic wiles and the full blessings of Christianity, Second Corinthians 2 verse 11; Romans 8 verse 32.     **\n14)\tWomen Ministry.   **\nGenesis 1 verse 27 and 28    **\nGod created the man and the woman as complimentary beings and gave them the right to multiply and rule the earth. The Man was created first, and then the woman. Both were created to serve the same purpose. Whatever the man was assigned to do, the woman was to help him in doing it. She is to do it along with the man, Genesis 2 verse 18.  We see the woman working along with the man in family life, societal life and administration and in the Christian ministry, First Corinthians 11 verse 11,12; 9 verse 5; Acts 18 verse 24 to 26.   **\nThe Scripture gave us instances of women in the Old Testament who were used by God to Minister in word and doctrine to both men and women, privately and publicly. Such include     **\nI)\tMariam; Exodus 15 verse 20 and 21; Numbers 12 verse 1 and 2; Micah 6 verse 4   **\nII)\tII)\tDeborah; Judges 4 verse 1 to 9   **\nIII)\tHuldah; Second Chronicles 34 verse 20 to 28.   **\nWomen are disciples of Jesus and the great commission involves them too, Matthew 28 verse 18 to 20; Mark 16 verse 15 to 18. When Jesus resurrected from death He commissioned Mary Magdalene with the resurrection message to His disciples, John 20 verse 11 to 17. Philip the evangelist had four daughters who prophesied to the church, Acts 21 verse 8 and 9. Women have the liberty to prophesy in the church, First Corinthians 11 verse 4 to 6. To prophesy is to speak to men to edification, exhortation and comfort, Acts 14 verse 3. Women can teach in the church, Matthew 28 verse 18 to 20; Acts 18 verse 24 to 26; Titus 2 verse 3 to 5. The Bible is against women that are unruly, disobedient, usurping authority over men. Such should be put under control, to learn in silence, not to teach First Corinthians 40 verse 33 to 35;   First Timothy 1 verse 9 to 11. Christian women who serve the Lord in righteousness and holiness should avail themselves before the Holy Spirit to use them whichever way He wills, Matthew 9 36-38. \n Hence holy women can preach, teach, sing, pray, prophesy, lead, pastor according to God's call and grace.   **\n15)\t Holy Communion    **\nHoly communion, also called the Lord's supper, is a rite Jesus instituted for His followers to be observed often in remembrance of His sacrificial death for  them, until He returns to rapture the saints, Luke 22 verse 19 and 20. The fact that this rite was carried out in the evening does not mean it must only be taken in the evening. What is significant here is the memory it communicates to the Church concerning the sacrificial death of Jesus anytime it is taken. The Lord's further revelation to apostle Paul confirms the observance of this rite in the Church, First Corinthians 11 verse 23 to 30.    **\n  The following are stated in the Paul's presentation  **\na.\tThe bread represented the body  **\nb.\tThe wine (nonalcoholic) represented the blood.   **\nc.\tThe taking of those two items is in remembrance of Jesus' death till He returns.   **\nd.\tThis rite is to be observed often by the Church.   **\ne.\tThe partakers must ensure there is no unconfessed, unrepented sin in their lives.  Hence self-examination is required.    **\nf. It is dangerous for sinners to partake of this rite in their sins and wickedness   **\ng. Judgment follows those who stubbornly take these substances in sin.   **\n16)\t Tithes And Offerings   **\nPayment of tithes to the Lord is a commandment of the Lord to humanity. Tithe is one-tenth of all earned income, be it money, food crop, animal reared, gains, interests or dividends in business. Tithe payment had been the observances of godly men right from the Old Testament, Genesis 14 verse 18 to 20; Genesis 28 verse 22. Additional commandments were added on tithe payment during the law of Moses, such as the tithe of tithes, first fruits offering and others. All these additives that originated in the law of Moses in the wilderness were abolished in Christ, Romans 10 verse 3 and 4.  However, payment of tithe as was before the law of Moses continues in the New Testament because Jesus our High Priest, after the order of Milchizedec, abides forever. As Abraham and his Sons (then in his bowels paid tithes to Milchizedec, so also children of Abraham by faith, who are believers in Christ, should pay tithes to Jesus Christ our present High Priest, who lives forever, Hebrews 7 verse 14,8-10,15 to 17; Galatians 3 verse 7. Not to pay tithe is to be cursed by God for being a thief and a robber of God. This minister is to incur the wrath of God. It is as sponsoring God's enemies against Him, Matthew 7 verse 6;  Second John 1 verse 7 to 11. Offering is that which one gives to God after tithe deduction and the amount is determined by individual, Malachi 3 verse 8 to 12       **                           \n17)\t Christian Dressing And Adornment     **\nThere is godly dressing and adornment and there is ungodly dressing and adornment. Believers are warned and commanded to steer clear from ungodly dressing and adornment. The use of trousers/pants/slacks by women or any uniquely masculine dress by women is condemned and the use of any uniquely feminine dress and adornment by men is equally condemned \nDeuteronomy 22 verse 5. Dresses exposing the sensitive parts of the body, hence promoting sexual arousal is evil and sinful, Matthew 5 verse 27 and 28;  First Corinthians 8 verse 9 and 12.    **\nBelievers’ dresses must properly cover them in sitting position and must properly cover them in standing positions they must not be tight on their body. Hair attachments, perming, Jerri curling of hair, use of wool, weavon, and dying of hair are evil adornment. Bleaching of skin, body painting, use of powder, lipsticks and cortex are evil. Believers must be simple, clean and natural in adornment. Use of earrings, rings, bracelets, beads, wedding ring, chains, necklace (Jewelry) is scripturally condemned as unholy adornment, First Peter 3 verse 3 to 5. See through dresses and clothes with jewels or shinning stones on them are to be avoided, Exodus 33 verse 4 to 6. Women should avoid fashionable thread in hairdo. Weaving or plaiting of hair must be free from worldly styles.    **\n18)\t The Rapture     **\nJesus left the earth back to heaven with the promise that He would return to take believers from earth to be with Him, John 14 verse 1 to 3. The Church is expecting the coming of Jesus to take her from the earth to heaven. This event is called the Rapture, the catching away of the saints from the earth in a moment, First Thessalonians 4 verse 13 to 18. We are in the end time and in the period of the rapture. Believers must always be in righteousness and holiness in preparation for this unique and universal event taking place any time from now, First John 3 verse 2 and 3. This event involves Jesus Christ, accompanied by heavenly angels and saints descending from heaven to the earth. The saints shall proceed to the earth for their bodily resurrection. True and holy believers who are alive on earth during that period shall suddenly be changed and their body shall be transformed into glorious body. The dead in Christ shall rise first and the saints alive on earth shall be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air, who shall go with them to heaven for the marriage supper of the Lamb and the reward or Judgment of saints. Revelation 19 verse 5 to 9; 22 verse 12 to 14.   **\n19)\t The Resurrections   **\nThere are two types of resurrections. These are called the first resurrection and the second resurrection, Revelation 20 verse 6. They are also called the resurrection of life and the resurrection of damnation, John 5 verse 28; Daniel 12 verse 2. The resurrection of Jesus Christ began the first resurrection. However, the first resurrection of believers in Christ will begin at the rapture, the resurrection of the Church age saints and end with the resurrection of Old Testament saints and tribulation saints, shortly before Christ's second coming for the millennial reign, after the Lord has finished His work on Israel at the end of the seventieth week prophesied over them, Daniel 9 24. All who partake of the first resurrection shall live and reign with Christ forever and ever in His eternal kingdom of righteousness, peace and joy.\nThe second resurrection is the resurrection of damnation which shall take place after the Millennial reign, after the last battle with Satan called the battle of Gog and Magog. All that ever lived and died in sin from the beginning of existence of man on earth to this period in time shall be resurrected for divine judgement and final condemnation to everlasting lake of fire, along with Satan and demons, the fallen angles, Revelation 20 verse 10, Matthew 25 verse 41.   **\n\n\nCHAPTER 9   **\nMY DOCTRINAL CONVICTION PART 3   **\n20)\t The Great Tribulation\nImmediately after the rapture of the saints, there shall be tribulation period for seven years. It shall be the period of practical reign of Satan through the Anti-Christ, the man of sin, First Thessalonians 2 verse 8 to 10. \nBefore the doom came upon humanity by the judgment of water, the few righteous, Noah and his family were rescued by means of the ark. Before Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed by the judgment of fire, the few righteous were removed, Lot and his family. Before the great Tribulation shall come upon the world of unbelief and wickedness the few righteous and holy on earth shall be caught away by means of the Rapture. The Tribulation periods of seven years is divided into two periods of three and half years. The first period of three and a half years is a period the Anti-Christ shall emerge, proffer solution to world crises and confusion and establish his rule. It is a period of false peace and prosperity by the Anti-Christ. Know also that the great tribulation period is a period of divine judgment upon the people of the world for rejecting their Creator and Saviour. This divine judgment shall spread over the tribulation period, from the beginning to the end. The wickedness of the ungodly over tribulation shall be great. The gospel of God's salvation in Christ shall be preached to make human beings submit to God's salvation in Christ and to deter them from submitting to the Anti-Christ by collecting his mark; 666  Revelation 14 verse 6, 7, 9 to 12. \nHence people shall still believe in Christ and be saved during the Great Tribulation period. The last three and a half years shall witness a greater intensity of the Antichrist's manifestation. At this time He shall face the Jews more intensely. He shall claim to be God and sit in the temple as God and demand their worship. On refusal by the Jews, there shall be Great War against them to wipe them out of existence. This war is called the battle of Armageddon.  Second Thessalonians 2 verse 4 and 5; Matthew 24 verse 15, 21, 22; Revelation 16 verse14 to 16.\nThe children of Israel during this period shall cry to God for their Messiah and repent of their folly in rejecting Jesus when He first came. The Lord shall fight against the Antichrist and his soldiers and destroy them.  The Antichrist and his false prophet shall be cast alive to the lake of fire, Revelation 19 verse 19 to 21.   **\n\n21)\t The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ    **\nThe first coming of Jesus was prophesied in the scripture Isaiah 7 verse 14; 9 verse 6 and 7. This was fulfilled in the New Testament, Matthew 1 verse21 to 23. He came as the Saviour of man to give eternal life to those who believe on Him, John 3 verse 14 to 16. He was despised and rejected of men. He was crucified and killed by men. He died and was buried. On the third day He rose from the dead and ascended to heaven, to return to earth to judge those who rebelled against Him, who denied Him, Acts 1verse 9 to 11. His first coming was silent and unannounced. But His second coming shall be with great glory. All eyes shall see Him. Matthew 24 verse 30. He shall be coming with His saints to rule the earth for a thousand years.   **\n22)\tChrist's Millennial reign   **\n Revelation 20 verse 1 to 6   **\nWhen Christ shall return to the earth in His second coming, Satan shall be bound and cast into the bottomless pit. The earth shall be cleared of his demons. All those who received the mark of the beast shall be destroyed. Occupants of the earth shall be made up of those who did not receive the mark of the beast 666, Christ shall establish His reign over the earth for one thousand years. His saints of both old and New Testament shall reign with Him. Those who are alive on earth at His coming who do not have the resurrected body shall live the normal natural life on earth. These shall still marry, produce and replenish the earth. The earth shall be restored to its original order, fruitfulness, beauty and perfection. Christ shall rule the world with the headquarters in Jerusalem. There shall be peace, righteousness, prosperity and joy on earth. The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of God as waters cover the sea. Isaiah2 verse 2 to 4, 11verse 6 to 10; Isaiah35 verse 110. Since the natural men shall be on earth during the millennial reign, those who do not consciously give their lives to Christ shall remain sinners. But sin shall be suppressed and greatly minimized.\nAfter the thousand years are over, the devil shall be loosed from the bottomless pit for a given time over the natural men that populate the earth to see those who have accepted or denied the Lord, having seen His glory, works and power over humanity and nature. Alas, many shall still submit to the deception of Satan against the Lord Jesus and His saints. Satan shall gather them against the Lord at the battle of Gog and Magog, the number of his army shall be as the sand of the sea shore. These shall be destroyed and Satan shall be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone to be tormented forever and ever, Revelation 20 verse 1 to 10. This shows that the problem of a sinner is not just Satan but his innate nature which must be brought to Christ for His salvation. Showing love and favour may not result to his righteousness. He must exercise practical faith in Christ for His salvation and thorough cleansing, Psalms 51 verse 110, Isaiah 26  verse10.   **\n23)\tThe Great White Throne Judgement    **\nRevelation 20 verse 11 to 15, Matthew 25 verse 41 to 44; Mark 9 verse 43 to 48 .This will occur after the millennial reign and the last rebellion of men on earth after the war. All the dead from the beginning of the earth to the last rebellion after the millennial reign shall resurrect. This resurrection is called the second resurrection. All who resurrect at this time shall be damned forever by God Before this condemnation, they shall be judged by the Lord Jesus Christ so that everyone should know the reason why he is being condemned by the God of truth and justice. Hence, they shall be judged according to their works. After this they shall be cast into the lake of fire. Damnation and torments of the lake of fire is known as the second Death. The present hell fire which is underneath the earth temporarily harbours the souls of dead sinners. When the sinners return from hell to earth for the great white throne judgement and are cast into the lake of fire, Hell fire also shall be cast into the lake of fire. Death also shall be cast into the lake of fire. Satan, demons and sinners shall be tormented forever and ever. This shall end all rebellions by God's creatures.    **\n24)\t Hell fire, Lake of fire,    **\n Luke 16 verse 19 to 31; Isaiah 5 verse 13 to 14; Revelation 20 verse 11 to 15 Hell fire is a place of torment and untold suffering, where dead sinners go from the beginning of the earth, until the final judgement of God on them, after the millennial reign of Jesus. The Bible severally reveals that hell fire is underneath the earth, Numbers 16 verse 30 to 34. It is a place of flames of fire and tormenting worms. Satan and his demons are not now passing through judgement in hell because their time has not yet come, Matthew 8 verse 28 to 29.\nHowever, Satan and his demons presently are the workforce or the power or gates of hell. They are the tormentors of all men that are condemned to hell fire. The Bible reveals that hell fire is underneath the earth now as a temporary abode of the souls of sinners. After the final judgement both sinners and hell fire itself shall be cast into the lake of fire. This is where Satan and his demons too shall be cast into for proper and everlasting torments. This shall be the final end of rebellious Satan, his angels and mankind.\nIn the story narrated by Jesus the rich man could see Lazarus in Paradise which was underneath the earth. They were separated by a great gulf fixed by God, which was covered with water. Unto this paradise Jesus and the converted thief on the cross descended after death.\nIt was here all righteous people from all generation waited for the final Atonement by Christ through His blood. The Bible shows that paradise was taken away from underneath the earth to Heaven after the resurrection of Christ, so that the dead in Christ now goes straight to Heaven where Christ is, Luke 16 verse 23 to 26; 23 verse 40 to 43; Ephesians 4 verse 8 to 10; Philippians 1 verse 21 to 24.    **\n\n25)\t The New Heaven And The New Earth    **\nAfter the final judgement of rebellious men and condemnation of Satan and his followers to the lake of fire, the Lord Jesus shall deliver the kingdom to His Father that God may be all in all, First Corinthians 15 verse 24 to 28 “Heaven” as used in the scripture refers to both the atmospheric space of clouds, moon, sun, stars and galaxies and to the place of the throne of God, which Apostle Paul called the third heaven, Second Corinthians 12 verse 15.This is where the saints of Old Testament had been seeking passionately with all commitment and consecration to enter into, Hebrews 11 verse 13 to 16.Jesus called this place “My Father's house,” This is His present promise for all faithful and holy believers, John 14 verse 1 to 3. However, the scriptures reveal to us the final state of eternal life with God to be more expanded than the present heaven where God and His angels dwell. There shall be a recreation, a great renovative work over the earth and the atmospheric heaven that shall bring up creative excellence, Isaiah 65 verse 17 to 19;  Second  Peter 3 verse 13 to 14.   **\nThe headquarters of the eternal state shall be New Jerusalem which is created by God and preserve pure and holy in heaven for this period. It shall descend from heaven to the atmosphere above the recreated or renewed earth and shall serve as the abode of God. The saints shall dwell with God in perfection and shall experience perfect love, peace, joy, satisfaction, pleasures, power, and comfort. There shall be no more pain, sorrow or death, Revelation 21 verse 1 to 5.   **\n26)\tProphecies and Revelation Experiences    **\nDaniel 2 verse 19 to 22; Ephesians 3 verse 1 to 3, Revelation 1 verse 1 to 3\nGod revealeth secret and hidden things. He revealed things to Joseph, Daniel, Paul, John and others. Jesus promised that Holy Spirit shall reveal things to His followers, John 16 verse 13 to 16.Some revelations are personal and if they will edify others they are to be testified of, Mark 13 verse 37. Through the gift of prophecy the secrets of men are revealed,  First  Corinthians 14 verse 24 and 25. Prophesy should not be despised. It is God speaking in prophecies,  First Thessalonians 5 verse 20. God can transport the spirit of a man to somewhere to see and hear His works and plans and to return to the body and testify to others, Ezekiel 40 verse 1 to 4. God can take people to hell to see the horror of it and return to testify to others, to serve as warning to them against sin and Satan, Isaiah 66 verse 24.\nGod can take a person to heaven to see the bliss of eternity according to His desired purpose, as He did with Paul the apostle. The form this will take is the prerogative of God,  First Corinthians12 verse 1 to 5. Prophecies and revelations of God as in Scripture are valid today, Hebrews 13 verse 8.Hence, the present prophetic revelations and visions given by God to chosen individuals are Scriptural and should be accepted,  First Thessalonians 5 verse 19 to 21. What the scripture cautions is to test the spirit and to ensure the message given is not contrary to the scripture, Galatians 1 verse 6 to 9;  First John 4 verse 1 and  2. Many stumbled over revelation experiences because of what Abraham said to the rich man in Hell, Luke 16 verse 27 to 31. The dialogue was between the rich man and Abraham and not between him and God. Neither Abraham nor the Angles know what strategy God has in the end time, in His wisdom, as the master soul winner, Proverbs 11 verse 13.Authentic prophecies and revelations are doing much today, as in the Bible days to save sinners and edify the saints,  First  Corinthians 14 verse 3. Guided by the Holy Spirit, Holiness Revival Movement accepts prophecies, Revelations and Visions of God and gives opportunity for them to be shared for the edification of the saints and salvation of sinners. He that sees me as a false prophet, a false preacher, a false teacher or a false minister does harm to himself and to those that believe him and they both shall face the wrath of God. Those who choose to accuse me, go ahead. Could Jesus have bothered Himself about those who called him Beelzebub? He had more work to do. He has been saying to me, constantly, “my son, these things are distractions, they are distracting your attention, move forward and preach the gospel without minding them.”   **\n27)\t Acceptable Day of Worship     **\nJesus showed us the nature of God and how to worship Him acceptably   **\nJohn 4 verse 22 to 24    **\n\t“Ye worship ye know not what  we know What we worship  for salvation is of the Jews.\n\tBut the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth  for the Father seeketh such to worship Him. \n\tGod is a Spirit  and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth.”    **\n\nThe life quality required to give God delight is righteousness and holiness   First Peter 1 verse 14 to 16. Holiness is obedience and conformity to the scripture in moral standard. The true worship of God does not lay emphasis on a place, a day and time, John 4 verse 21. God sanctified the seventh day and rested on it, but did not tell Adam or the Old Testament saints to worship Him on that day. The righteousness of Enoch, Noah, Abraham and other Old Testament Saints, before the law, was complete and heaven worthy without observance of the Sabbath day. It was the righteousness of faith, Romans 4 verse 3. Believers today are after the faith of Abraham who are being justified by faith in Christ, without observing the Sabbath day given in the law, Galatians 3 verse 6 to 9. The observance of the Sabbath is not a moral law but ceremonial. All such laws given to Moses were abolished in Christ, Romans 10 verse 4. To continue to observe the Sabbath day because it was commanded in the Law of Moses, shows the ignorance of the observers of righteousness through grace in Christ. Such observers are compelled by Scripture to obey all other requirements of the Law of Moses in other to live. This certainly they cannot do, Roman 10 verse 5; Galatians 3 verse 10 to 14.   **\n\nSunday Observance    **\nThe observance of Sunday today, as a day of worship for Christians, is not a commandment of Scripture, but a tradition handed down from the Apostles and believers in the early church. Since Jesus rose from death on the first day of the week, being Sunday, it was called the Lord's day. Christian solemn day of rest and worship shifted from Sabbath day in the law to Sunday, Luke 24 verse 1 to 6; Revelation 1 to 10; Acts 20 verse 7.    **\n\nDifferent Worship Days Today     **\nToday, we see that different days are adopted by various Christian bodies and societies as the day to be observed for rest and worship. These include Sunday, Saturday and Friday. Those in Muslim communities see Friday as a free day to consecrate for rest and worship. Whichever day is chosen with satisfactory reasons and is consecrated for rest and worship is acceptable by God, as long as the worship is in truth, righteousness and holiness. But to worship on Saturday because it is the Sabbath day and because it was commanded in the law of Moses is to display spiritual ignorance and darkness towards the true worship of God. Some are just being deceived by demons into this practice, Romans 14 verse 4 to 6; Colossians 2 verse 16 to 22.    **\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10    **\nMY LEADERSHIP ROLE IN HOREMOW   **\nMy administration over Holiness Revival Movement is in righteousness and holiness, First Samuel 12 verse 3 to 5 \nBehold, here I am  witness against me before the Lord, and before His anointed  whose ox have I taken? Or whose ass have I taken? Or whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? And I will restore it you. And they said, thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand. And he said unto them, the LORD is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.\n\nI have worked with leaders all these years in this Holiness Movement with a pure conscience. I have not oppressed any of the coordinators. I have not cheated any of them. I have not planned evil against any of them. Whoever was removed from being a coordinator knew himself. Not one of them will come to point accusing finger against me. I do my best through prayer to follow the will of God over each of them. I treat the members of the Movement in the same way from the beginning of the Ministry to today. The LORD will help me; I will live in this way to the end. Amen. \nThe people told Samuel that they had seen his righteous and holy life and that they were witnesses.\nI am saying this because there is an adage that says“ nobody is completely righteous.” The mentality many have is that holiness of life is not possible. God said to me , “My son, the people don't believe that you are holy; it is because they don't believe the possibility of holiness.” Now the Scripture says, Jesus died for the church in order to make us sanctified and holy. If someone would say holiness of life is not a possibility, he is underrating Christ's sacrifice. To the impure all things are impure. If you are impure and unholy, you will think that all people are impure and unholy. An adulterer will think all men commit adultery. The Word of God is true. God's Word has the power to save and sustain you in salvation. The blood of Jesus has the power to purify and sustain you in holiness. Change your mentality. What Satan wants to tell the world is that even, the man (That's me) they call holy man of God is not really holy. That is what Satan wants to say so that you will be discouraged. He wants to accuse the holy children of God in order to discourage people from believing they can be holy. In order to make people believe in and seek holiness of life and ministry, God has moved me to write this sincere personal account of my life and ministry.\nThe administration of Holiness Revival Movement by me is in righteousness and holiness. As a righteous leader, I lead in the fear of God, fearing no man and respecting no person in order to please God and work out true righteousness and holiness of those I preach to.   **\nSecond Chronicles 19 verse 5 to 10.    **\n“And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,\nAnd said to the judges, Take heed what ye do  for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment. \nWherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do it  for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts. \nMoreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem. \nAnd he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do \nin the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. \nAnd what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren  this do, and ye shall not trespass.”    **\nI ensure my judgment is from perfect heart, my administration is from a perfect heart, my teaching, my oversight and my counseling shall have no error. I am always careful with every counsel I give because there is God that is hearing me and I shall give account to Him. It is a delicate job that is why the Bible says, be not many teachers, because we that teach shall receive the greater condemnation. I do these things without respect of persons. I treat every person according to scripture specification. No one is greater than the scripture. I must do to everyone as God directs me, if I desire eternal life and reward from Him.    **\n\nMy Mentorship    **\nIn 2010, God led me to start non-denominational chapter meeting or fellowship where people from different churches can assemble together and learn God's word of Truth, Righteousness and Holiness. \nBy the grace of God I authored many other books, some of which are revelation books like that of Michael Sambo. The Lord who brought Michael Sambo to me for my care and mentorship in ministry also brought many other brethren who received similar revelations to me for mentorship. I came to discover that it is part of my calling to mentor these people and coordinate the revelation message for proper and understandable presentation to the church and the world. In the course of ministry with Michael Thomas Sambo, by the end of 2011 I came to understand that he desired independence from me. In 2012, shortly before his marriage, he requested that he would like to stay apart by himself in Taraba State after his marriage. All this while he had been staying with me in Abuja and I had thought to get an accommodation in the same vicinity for himself and his wife. I succumbed to his request. I asked if I could give him monthly allowance for his maintenance in Jalingo. He objected to this, saying that the Lord had instructed him not to be under salary. I loved and cared for him and his family ensuring they were not in want. I did not cease to correct and rebuke him in love over his spiritual errors.    **\nThe Withdrawal of Michael Thomas from Holiness Revival Movement    **\nMy dealing with Michael Thomas Sambo as a minister under me in the sight of God and in the light of Scripture was void of envy, pride, hatred, selfishness, oppression or any such thing. I ensured I related with him in truth, righteousness and holiness, with pure conscience. But I noticed continually some impurities \nin his life. I enquired diligently from God what I should do about it, especially after a gross misconduct. The Lord told me he was not living the life of holiness which he preaches in Holiness Revival Movement worldwide and directed me to place him on discipline for the gross misconduct he displayed to wake him up to the righteous and holy life required of him.  This instruction was received in September 2015. When I received this instruction from God, from protracted prayer on Michael Thomas Sambo, I assembled key leaders and some selected people within the Movement to serve as witnesses and advisers to him in the day the discipline would be pronounced on him. This was done within the month of September 2015. Not as we hoped, the discipline ended the service of Michael Thomas Sambo with Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. He left Holiness Revival Movement and opened his own ministry by which he now ministers. All my effort and those of others in Holiness Revival Movement to recover him have failed.\nAlthough I hear many stories, accusations and blackmail against me concerning him, I am not disturbed but peaceful because I know, I have not hurt him, neither is God charging me with sin on his account. My conscience bears me witness in the Holy Ghost. Many have been made to stumble before the Lord by his actions and narrations. All I have said here about him is not with the intention to tarnish his image or ministry; for he still has opportunity to amend his ways and be forgiven by God and man. But I feel compelled to say these if I may by any means save some who have been misinformed, misled and have backslidden from the Lord because of this matter.      **\nDiscipline for the Erring    **\nAll those who serve the Lord as ministers and leaders under me must live in this way in order to maintain holiness and righteousness in this precious End time Holiness Revival Movement, Philippians 3 verse 12 to 15; 4 verse 8 and 9. Those among the leaders under me who are backslidden from the true faith of Christ and are not living righteous and holy, not holding to the truth of Scripture anymore are being removed and replaced. This is done by God's working. He knows the people and will handle them according to His grace, wisdom and judgement. \nAre we going to employ preachers that will come and destroy this holy work again? No. “His bishopric let another take.” That is what we do according to the word of God, Titus 1 verse 5 to 11; Second Timothy 3 verse 16 and 17, yet I must state here that patience, love, admonition and kind actions are being applied on the erring, Second Timothy 3 verse 16 to 17 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness  that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.\nThe scriptures are used for correction, reprove and rebuke. The scripture should be pointed out to the erring one to correct his way.   **\n\nHebrews 12 verse 5 to 11    **\n“And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, my son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of Him. For whom the Lord loveth He chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom He receiveth. If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons  for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not? But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then ye are bastards, and not sons. Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence  shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?  For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure; but He for our profit, that we might be partakers of His holiness”. Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous  nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.”    **\nDefinitely we must discipline the erring. We must remove people from service when they are not performing. We must rebuke and correct people. A father does so to his children. A master does same to his servants. If I am a father in Holiness Revival Movement, if I am a master to people who serve under me, can I not therefore correct them? Can I not frown at and disapprove of an ungodly character? This is done for their perfection and holiness that they may inherit eternal life, but many refuse the correction of a loving father and go about to abuse and curse me on the streets, on the internet, through radio and on Facebook. They say all manners of things. Well, the Lord has said,“ Leave them for Me and go forward.” I leave them for God and move forward.   **\n\nMake Your Choice on What to Hear   **\nI will not waste my time responding to them, no, I will preach on my message. Those people who have ears to hear will hear, but those who feel that they should be listened to can go and join them. Alcohol is there for them that are ready to perish. But the good wine is there for them who are ready to merry. The good wine is the good word of God. \nThe accusations and criticisms of sinners are the alcohol. Do you want alcohol? Go and drink and be drunken and be ready to perish. But do you want to merry in Christ? Come for the good wine, drink, and be merry in Christ and go to Heaven.\nI preach light, I don't preach darkness. Amen. If you want to perish listen to my opposers. If you want to have eternal life listen to what I am preaching. Because I do not do the things I do by myself, the Lord has been bearing witness that it is by His grace I live and do what I do. He has in many different ways spoken of me. The testimonies have been so many; you might have heard many of them. Michael Thomas Sambo said the Lord told him in Heaven in his divine revelation experience, “I have raised up a man that will propagate this message. I am sending you to him, He is Pastor Paul Rika. Of course the Lord has raised me up for this work. In a figure I died in Deeper Life Bible Church so that I might resurrect with a new people and raise up a new Holiness Movement so that men and women may experience this holiness that was put in a corner in the Christendom. Today the whole world is shining and rejoicing from nation to nation, city to city, race to race! Why? Somebody risked his life, risked his ministry to fight this battle against man and Satan. Satan did his worst but it did not work. He did all that was in his power, but the power of Satan failed.   **\nSister Linda   **\nSister Linda also came up after her divine revelation encounter saying the Lord Jesus told her, “I have raised a Movement on the earth and it is My Movement  I have put My son over it, who teaches My true word. Go and join them. If you obey all that My son teaches there, you will be qualified for heavenly inheritance. You will surely make it when I come.”\nGod wants you too to be in Holiness Revival Movement. You will find a place of safety for your spiritual life. You will find ministry in Christ. You will find holiness and usefulness. I trust this is what the Lord is telling you too. God has given Sister Linda a place in this Movement, as you can see. She is doing well. Amen. The Lord will grant her eternal life. She is not the only one God has given testimony concerning Pastor Paul Rika and Holiness Revival Movement. Several people have been used by God to testify of His grace upon me and the Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide.    **\nCHAPTER 11   **\nJESUS’ MESSAGE TO THE METHODIST CHURCH IN MYSTERY WRITING - INTERPRETED WEDNESDAY 24th MAY, 2017    ** \nI Pastor Paul Rika, returned back to Nigeria from my trip to Canada and U.S and was told by my brethren that a member of Methodist Church, Sister Bester S. Michael, had an encounter with the Lord Jesus through near death experience during their Regional Women Conference held in United Methodist Church, Masaka, Nassarawa State, 11th-14th May, 2017. Sister Bester got completely restored and came with many messages from the Lord to individuals and to the Methodist Church. She demanded for a note book and wrote illegible, unknown and unreadable writing on it. According to her, the Lord Jesus told her in the encounter that no one in the world could read the writing, except Pastor Paul Rika. In similar incidence appeared in Bible account of Daniel.    **\nDaniel 5 verse 5 to 13.    **\n“In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace  and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. \nThen the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. 7 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. \nThen came in all the king's wise men  but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.\nThen was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied. \nNow the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house  and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever  let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed \nThere is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king \nNebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; \nForasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar  now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation. \nThen was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?”    **\nPrayer And Fasting    **\nWhen I heard of this, I wondered how this could be done by me. Apart from the Daniel's interpretation in scripture over the writing of King Belshazzar, I had never heard anything of that nature again. I thought within myself, if God wanted to do such wonders through me, I would watch how it would come up. I declared fasting and prayer with my leaders the next day, being Tuesday, the 23rd of May, 2017, to hear what God would say about this issue, even as Daniel did.    **\nDaniel 2 verse 17 to 23    **\n“Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions \nThat they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon. \nThen was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. 20 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever  for wisdom and might are his \n And he changeth the times and the seasons  he removeth kings, and setteth up kings  he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding  \nHe revealeth the deep and secret things  he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. \nI thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee  for thou hast now made known unto us the king's matter.”\n\nBrief Testimony Of Sister Bester Michael The Visioner United Methodist Church, Ham Street, Malali, Kaduna.   **\n+2348135734667\nMy name is Bester S Michael, wife to Pastor Michael of United Methodist Church, Kaduna. We had Regional women convention of our church in Masaka, Nassarawa State. I left Kaduna along with some women to attend the conference. There was a heavy down pour of rain as we arrived Abuja. Suddenly, I began having a feeling of great discomfort. My breath began to cease and sweat started to drip down my body. I felt like vomiting and told the driver to pull over so I could ease myself. I started to pray and ask God for mercy as my health was getting worse. As we drove close to the church in Masaka, I almost passed out. My breath was ceasing. I was still pleading with the Lord to show me mercy, for I was afraid for my soul. I enjoined the women to pray for me and ask God for forgiveness in any area I had sinned against Him. The attention of pastor Alpha was called upon who asked the women to bring me into the vestry. Our District Superintendent got information about my health condition and decided to intervene. Within me I felt I wasn't going to survive, but would die. Prayers were made for me by others and the District Superintendent but to no avail. I managed to participate in the convention's activities from Thursday, the 11th of May and by Saturday, the 13th of May 2017, I gave up hope of staying alive.  **\nMy Divine Encounter\nI had to call my husband on phone to ask him to pardon me in any way I had offended him; for I noticed two angels waiting to take me. I began to preach to the women around me, telling them never to hold this world dearly, but to serve God faithfully with all their hearts. The angels stood right with me, saying they had come to take me. I pleaded with them to let me call and talk to my husband. Suddenly the Lord Jesus spoke to me with a loud voice, saying He had added more years to me. With the Lord's authoritative voice, strength came into me instantly. I became suddenly healthy and began to praise and thank the Lord.\nThe Lord spoke again and asked me to see. He supernaturally opened my eyes to see my husband praying to the Lord, crying bitterly before Him, asking Him to have mercy and spare my life, that he needed me alive for the work of the ministry. The Lord said, He heeded the cry of my husband to keep me alive, but that he would give me messages to deliver to others. I started to cry and asked Him why He chose me, being the youngest among the pastor's wives.\nThe Lord started to speak and asked me to get a writing pen and paper. I got astonished, because I asked the women around me to please get me pen and paper but they bluntly refused to do so. I asked again and again, telling them that Jesus instructed me to get a writing sheet and a pen so I could write down the messages He wanted me to deliver. The women remained adamant.\nNone among them in the room with me made any attempt to do so. I pleaded with them to get me a writing sheet and a pen that the Lord commanded me to do so. They paid deaf ears to my shock and disappointment. The Lord Jesus stood right there with me and gave me messages for them and I passed the same to them. I began to thank and praise God for choosing to use me. The Lord gave me a message to pastor Alpha the host pastor, which I passed to him. He received it and began to thank God. As we remained in the presence of the Lord, one of the pastors walked in.  The Lord Jesus began to speak and admonish us to respect and honor our pastors because by so doing we are honoring and respecting Him. The Lord told us to desist from disrespecting our pastors because doing so dishonors Him and His presence. The Lord Jesus by His Spirit told me never to expose my body to anyone, except my husband alone. He is the one that is permitted to see my nakedness. This reproof came because I stepped outside to receive fresh air without covering my body properly. I was still appealing to the women to get me a writing material and a pen, but none paid attention to me. I was ignored. I became grieved and held and twisted the ears of Pastor Alpha's wife for her stubbornness to the Lord's instruction. Jesus was standing right beside me, waiting for me to 107 get the writing sheet and a pen. The woman missed her blessing for refusing the Lord's instruction and no one among the women made any move to do so. However, one of the church members observed how serious I was concerning the writing sheet and pen she rushed to get one for me. The Lord instructed me to bless the woman who brought me the writing sheet and pen. The blessing that was meant for pastor Alpha's wife was given to the woman who obeyed His instruction.    **\nHow I Wrote the Mystery Writing    **\nThe Lord then instructed me to write. I became confused because I was not good in writing and in spelling. The Lord commanded me to start writing which I did. As I held the pen, I began to write illegible mystery which no mortal could read or interpret. I wrote on several pages, until the Spirit of God asked me to stop and go to bed. As I lay down I began to have sweet communion with the Lord, just like two friends having a private conversation.\nThe women began to pray, asking the Lord to use one of them to interpret what was written so that people would not doubt the writing and the message. But the Lord said that the only living mortal that would be able to interpret the mysterious writing was Pastor Paul Rika, the International Director of Holiness Revival Movement, Worldwide. The Lord told me that the person to take me to see Pastor Paul Rika would be pastor Alpha.\nAs we embarked on our journey back to Kaduna, the Lord having promised us safety in our journey, I noticed earrings hanging on the ears of one of the women and I asked the woman if she knew the source of those earrings. The Lord opened my eyes to see that earrings are from the underworld, from demon spirits. The Lord gave stern warning against the use of jewelry on our body.  **\nComment Of Pastor Alpha Jesmiel Hoki, Host Pastor.\nUnited Methodist Church, U turn, Masaka,       \nNassarawa State, +2347063442358 \nI am Pastor Alpha of the United Methodist Church, Masaka. I am a witness to everything that transpired at the women's convention.  I happened to be the guest speaker at the convention by the grace of God.\nLet me take you back, down memory lane. We have been hearing about Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, but have never been partakers of the Movement.\nOn the 11th of May, 2017, I was in Masaka for the women convention of our Church. Since on the 10th I began to have a different feeling. I was given the topic “We Should Shine as a Light in This World,'' but the Lord said I should change the topic to “Holy Character in a Holy Place,” which was one of the titles preached by Pastor Paul Rika. I so much loved that topic.\nDuring the convention we got carried away with so many things and didn't focus on what brought us to that convention. On Friday, Message came to me from the Lord Jesus that women should consecrate themselves and be holy because He would visit them. I told the women that we would engage ourselves in fasting for six hours, from 6 00am to 12noon. I told them that the Lord Jesus would visit the convention and that they would see Him. After the fast we began to pray. I laid my hands on sister Bester Michael and saw manifestation of the Lord. Many women began to cry. At midnight, after prayers, I went to my room. I had never experienced such presence of the Lord, it was awesome. Suddenly I heard voices of women calling for me. At first I thought they were under attack. I began to pray and to rebuke the devil. But the Lord Jesus made me to understand that He was the one visiting sister Bester, as I earlier saw the manifestation of God on her. The Lord Jesus told us to leave her alone. Great things happened that night. The Lord instructed that a pen and paper be given her to write and she began to pen down illegible and mystery writing which only God could grant the interpretation.\nThe Lord Jesus said that the only man on earth that could read and interpret such mysterious writing would be Pastor Paul Rika. Sister Bester Michael said and wrote great things that night. The Lord maintained that Pastor Paul Rika was the only man on earth to interpret the revelation of those writings and that I, Pastor Alpha, would be the one to lead sister Bester to see Pastor Paul Rika, the International Director of Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide.\nComment Of Pastor James Michael, Husband To Sister Bester Michael United Methodist Church,  Ham Street, Malali, Kaduna. +2347036189472\nMy name is Pastor James Michael, I am the presiding pastor of United Methodist Church, Malali Area, Kaduna state, and the husband to Sister Bester Michael.\nOn Thursday, the 11th May, 2017, I escorted my wife with the rest of the women who were traveling to Masaka, Nassarawa state, Nigeria, for their Regional Women convention made up of four states. I had not the slightest thought that anything would happen to my wife. All I noticed about my wife was that she was observing some days of fasting and prayer, according to the leading of the Holy Spirit, for reasons unknown to me. I didn't ask either. I got to know about the fast when I needed her and she told me she was on a fast.\nAt about 3pm, Saturday 13th May 2017, my wife from the conference called to ask me to forgive her in any way she had offended me. I became apprehensive and asked for the reasons she was saying those things. She replied by saying she was the only person who knew what she was passing through. With that response I also asked her to forgive me in any way I too had offended her. She replied by saying I had not offended her in anyway.\nRight on the spot that I stood in my house, I went down on my knees and started to pray to God. I cried to the Lord and I reminded Him that He gave my wife to me to help me in the work of the ministry. I told the Lord that if my wife should die, I wouldn't marry again and I wouldn't associate myself with anybody. I pleaded with the Lord to have mercy and spare the life of my wife. From that period I received no call to inform me about the health status of my wife.\nWhen my wife returned from the convention I beheld a shining bright light over her. Her face shone so brightly that I could not freely look at her as I observed her. She began to speak and minister to me.    **\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12    **\nTHE MYSTERY WRITING AND THE INTERPRETATION   **\nThe writing bellow is three pages out of the nine pages of the mystery writing that the Lord instructed Sister Bester S. Michael to write as message to the Methodist Church. The full interpretation follows the writing.       **\n\nThe Night Vision And The Interpretation   **\nAfter our prayer and fasting Tuesday, 23rd May, that night, the Lord gave the following vision \nIt was like people assembled together in a Church auditorium. A board was set before the people,  having the unreadable writing or message Jesus gave to Sister Bester for the Methodist Church pasted on it. People were wondering how someone could read this writing and bring out the message. At this point I, Pastor Paul Rika, came and began to read the writing and make the message known to the people. The writing looked like a Hebrew writing to the people. I began by saying, “The word of God says,   **\n“ I rebuke the Methodist Church. You are out of My way. I am about to spue you out of My mouth.   **\n\nRevelation 3 verse 15  to 20.   **\n“I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot  I would thou wert cold or hot. 16 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of My mouth. \nBecause thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked \nI counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see. \nAs many as I love, I rebuke and chasten  be zealous therefore, and repent. \nBehold, I stand at the door, and knock  if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me.”   **\nI hear the sound of your worship, but I cannot see through to those worshipping. This is because you are covered with darkness of sin and evil.    **\nMatthew 15 verse7 to 9    **\n“Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, \nThis people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.     \n  But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.”    **\n Methodists, you are full of pride. If you really want to  recover from your spiritual bankruptcy and wretchedness, I counsel you to associate yourselves with Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, where you will learn My true word for your righteousness and holiness. Don't look down on Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide (HOREMOW.) I raised this Ministry up, this end time, as a spiritual guide for all churches in the world. Many of your members who have died, came to realize this too late for themselves. If you refuse to humble yourselves to obey My instruction, your members alive today will also come to realize this when it is too late for them. \nI decided to give this message to you at the grass root and not to your top leaders, because they have left my way and gone into various sins. Methodists, the sin of adultery, fornication, Idolatry, witchcraft, drunkenness, freemason, occultism, covetousness, homosexuality, lesbianism, and such like is smelling among you.    **\n   Galatians 5 verse 19 to 21    **\n“Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,  \n\tIdolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, \nEnvyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like  of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”    **\nRepent of your sins, lest I spue you out of my mouth. Know that when I came to the world as a human being, I went to the common people, not to the Pharisees, scribes and Sadducees, who were the corrupt leaders of the people, full of vain glory. \nThe reason I did not relate this to My daughter in plain language, but put it in unknown writing to her, is because she is not holy before Me. She and her husband have faults in their lives which they have to settle with Me. Their work is not perfect before Me. They will not have the boldness to declare this word fully to you, due to fear of accusation and condemnation from others. This shows you the kinds of pastors you have over you.\n  I have directed the writing to Pastor Paul Rika as the only one in the World to read and make the message known to you. This is not for his pride but to let you know that I have chosen him to make you and others in the Churches know My word of truth, righteousness and holiness in this end time of backsliding and darkness in the churches.    **\n\n\nActs 9 verse 15.   **\n“But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way; for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel.”   **\nJeremiah 3 verse 15   **\n“ And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.”    **\nEND OF THE INTERPRETATION   **\nPastor Paul Rika\nThis interpretation was given before I met with them and saw the actual writing a day after.        **\n\n\nCHAPTER 13   **\nCOMMENTS OF THE THREE  AFTER INTERPRETATION   **\nPastor Alpha Jamiel Hoki   **\nConcerning the interpretation of the writing, when \nPastor Paul Rika started saying “The Lord rebuke Methodist Church” I felt it. It is true because we have a problem in our modern church as a result of election of our Bishop. What the Lord said concerning drunkenness and other sins going on in our church is true. The interpretation is exactly what is happening. We earnestly thank the Lord for the interpretation. We promise God's servant, Pastor Paul Rika, that we shall deliver this message to our Bishop. The copy of this interpretation shall be read to all in our four conferences all over Nigeria. We also shall stand firmly on what the Lord Jesus has said. What our Sister wrote mysteriously was certainly what no mortal could interpret. We received instruction and directive as to who would interpret such mysterious writing and now indeed Pastor Paul Rika has interpreted the mystery writing. I never expected the interpretation to come out this way. I praise and thank the Lord for this. Now I have a document to back up what the Lord has begun to do among us. On behalf of this Church we thank the Lord and His servant for this great thing. Our Local Church and the entire Methodist church will embrace the doctrine of holiness so that at the end of it all, we shall make it to heaven. This is our desire; apart from this, there is nothing else that we desire.     **\n\n\n\nPastor James Michael    **\nWe thank God for the life of Pastor Paul Rika whom the Lord gave the mandate for the interpretation of this mystery writing. I am a Pastor of United Methodist Church. What the Lord accused the church of is true. Many of the pastors are drunkards and covetous. The Church is passing through crises now because of moral decay. I consent to the fact that I have fault in my life and my work is not perfect before God  I seek God for mercy. I give thanks to God for showing the Church mercy and for choosing this time to give us this message. I pray that the Lord Jesus will help us and the leadership of this Church worldwide to look into this vision and bring revival and changes to this church so that the members shall make it to heaven.    **\nSister Bester Michael  I want to appreciate God for His mercy and kindness upon my life. I am not worthy; honestly, I count myself not worthy for this event. I want to appreciate the Lord for His mercy. I want to also appreciate our Daddy, Pastor Paul Rika, whom God directed me to. I know this is from God and not of his own imagination. I believe this message will change the entire Methodist Church in Jesus name. Amen. As said in the interpretation, the reason the Lord did not relate this message to me in plain language but in unknown writing was because I was not holy before Him. This is true, I sinned before God. I believe as I sought His face after the encounter, He has restored me in His mercy. I appreciate God for this. I know that He has called me and He it is that revealed these things to me. He will lead me and be with me.\nMay the Lord increase the wisdom of Pastor Paul Rika and enlarge his ministry. I pray that God would give him long life so that his work will fill Nigeria and the world at large. May God bless him abundantly. I covet his prayers in order to overcome what we may face as a result of this revelation and message.  **\nRemark \nPastor Michael and Sister Bester sought private counseling with me Pastor Rika, on their spiritual life. They were advised on what to do to free themselves from guilt and condemnation for their Christian progress.    **\nMy Observation    **\nThanks to God for this interpretation He revealed in a night vision. I, Pastor Paul Rika, added the scripture quotations to make the message clearer and show how scriptural it is. The Lord be honoured in Methodist Church and in other churches worldwide by this mystery. \nThis great church was founded by John Wesley whom the Lord used to pioneer Holiness Movement in the world in the 18th century. It was founded on Biblical truth and redeemed many in the world. Many believers were purified in the Churches. By his lifestyle and teaching, many made it to heaven. He taught holiness of heart through a definite experience of sanctification in the heart of a believer, which is required to cleanse him from inbred sin, adamic nature or inward depravity, in order to render the heart holy and undefiled before God. He did not only emphasize on inward holiness, he also taught outward holiness which involves the removal of ungodly clothing and adornment for total conformity to the holiness of God.   **\nSecond Corinthians 7 verse 1    **\n“Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”   **\nRemoval of Jewelry (earring, rings, nose ring, wedding ring, bracelet, Necklace, beads and all items of ornamentation) is a Biblical command to Christian women  First Timothy 2 verse 8 to 10, Numbers 31 verse 50 to 51. Christian women should have proper head covering when praying or in worship service,  First Corinthians 11 verse 3 to 6. Permming, Jerry-curling, hair attachment, weave-on, wool in hair plaiting, is condemned in scripture. Also cortex, lipstick, painting of the body, bleaching, keeping of long nails, painting of nails, artificial eyelashes, use of short skirts or gown, body hugs, deep-cut dresses, trousers also called pants/slacks used by women, see through dresses, high heel shoes, dresses with shining stones, and such like, are condemned as promiscuous and the dressing of harlots by the scripture . Revelation 17 verse 1 to 6.   **\nProverbs 7 verse 10   **\n “And, behold, there met him a woman with the ATTIRE OF AN HARLOT, and subtil of heart.”   **\nBut the enemy has badly affected John Wesley's work. All the Methodist churches of various names are far away from the teachings of John Wesley today. Now youths in the church dress with sagging, do evil haircuts, wear earrings, put on tight-fitting clothes without rebuke in the church. Note also that divorce and remarriage when the marriage partner, man or woman, is still alive is a sin to God, Romans 7 verse 2 and 3;  First  Corinthians 7 verse  10 and  11. The fear of God has failed in many congregations.   **\nHoliness Revival Movement Worldwide (Horemow)    **\nIn our day the Lord Himself has raised up Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide (Non- Denominational) under the Leadership of my humble self, Pastor Paul Rika, the international Director, to restore Truth, Righteousness and Holiness back to His Church. Through Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide many sinners are being brought to the Lord and believers sanctified and made holy worldwide. It is a fast growing nondenominational ministry which has covered about 40 nations of the world as at the time of this writing.   **\nThe Sign of His Coming    **\nThis is one of the signs of the Lord's soon return. Believe this, it is not manmade. It is a message to all Churches. The Lord of the Church is rebuking all lukewarm and backsliding churches and is calling them to repentance and holiness. The preachers must repent of their sins and preach the true gospel message of repentance, righteousness and holiness to prepare their members for the rapture coming soonest. Members of backsliding churches that reject God's holiness and warning must allow God to lead them to His Truth, Righteousness and Holiness for their spiritual fitness and readiness for the Rapture. Do not submit to compromising, truth resisting and sin-filled church, not minding their wrath or love.    **\nHebrews 12 verse 14   **\n“ Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.”   **\n First John 3 verse 2 and 3   **\n“  Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be  but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. \n And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "THE PASSION FOR PURITY  **\n\n\nINTRODUCTION    **\nThe Bible says in Matthew 5 verse 8 “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God”. Nothing but purity will make us to see God. In this generation there are confusions everywhere, one need to be very careful to be able to make heaven.  \nAs you read this book, the Lord will help you to be pure; not only pure but have passion for purity.  \nGod bless you   **\n\nChapter One  Passion for Purity    **\n \nWhat is Passion?    **\nPassion means a strong desire; not just a desire but a strong one. It is the heart’s tension because of something strongly desired, something wished, something that is to be done or not to be done.  \nPassion is an inner longing. You are burdened within your heart for something or against something. Passion is a strong determination. The passionate heart is only released when the desire is achieved. When that which is longed for is fulfilled, then passion is said to have been achieved.  \nPassion, for instance we can say, ‘he loves him with passion, with much force’.  \nThe quantity of such love is deep inside. We can also say, ‘she hates him with passion’; which means that the force of the hatred is high indeed.  \nBut we are talking about the passion for purity. You can now understand not only purity but the passion for it. Wanting to be pure and wanting it with passion, with a great desire. Wanting the pure life, the pure heart; with all desire and all determination. Your heart should be on it. Say to yourself I must be pure. I must be holy and perfect.  \nLet the Bible open our eyes more to passion as in   **\n\nPsalms 42 verse1 to 5  **\n“ As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. \n My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God, when shall I come and appear before God? \n My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me where is thy God? When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me, for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday. \n Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God  for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance”.     **\n \n \n \nThe Passion of the Psalmist.   **\n \nPassion is described by some terms. As the hart panteth implies the animal is looking for the water brooks so that he can drink and quench his thirst. Panteth is as when somebody runs and after that he starts breathing heavily, making some heavy sound because the force inside is high. the breath is also with high tension. He is releasing the air highly inside because of the force generated by running. Panteth means you are looking for the thing so desperately as if without it you will die. An animal in such a situation will be jumping, panting and looking for it. So panteth my soul after thee, O God. Does your soul long for God like this? There is high thirst inside me. Look at it, “My soul thirsteth for God.” When you see a man thirsty for God; there will be tension inside him that wants to be satisfied with the Holy One. Esau had passion for food. He was so hungry to the point that he sold his birth right. The desire was so much inside of him. It was ruling and controlling him.   **\n \nPassionate thirst for God.   **\n \nWhen shall I come and appear before God? When the word “when” is part of passion, it denotes desperation for time with God. When will this be achieved? When can I arrive at the solution to this? When will I appear? When will it be said I have gotten it? Such is the person looking for it with passion.    **\nMy tears have been my meat reveals, I cry for it. I cry because of the longing. Tears fall from my eyes (passion). Because I long for this, I cry, I have no choice than to cry for it. Tears will just fall from my eyes; running down on my cheeks.  \nMy heart is there. When will I get it? My tears have been my meat day and night reveals that, passion is not a casual thing. Not just once in a while. I am in it. The desire is continuous. My longing is continuous; day and night. That is where my heart is. That is passion. Day and night as I remember these things, my heart is always there.  There is a thought inside that is controlling him. And such thought always heats his memories.   **\n“When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me  for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday”.    **\nThen why is this thing delaying; why art thou cast down? Do you see how it affects him that such desire is delaying? I'm delaying to achieve this, why? Why art thou disquieted in me? There is disquietness and restlessness in my heart. Why am I restless? Because of Passion!  “Why art thou disquieted, hope thou in God  for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance”.  \nFaith and hope in God.  \nThe passionate man has the hope and the faith that it shall be done. He is pursuing it with passion. It shall be done. He is running after it with passion. He encourages himself and said; God will help me. It shall be accomplished.    **\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter Two  The Purity in Christ     **\n \nHebrews 7 verse 25 to 27   **\n “wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. \n For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens; \n Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's;  for this he did once, when he offered up himself”.    **\n  \nThe scripture describes Jesus when He came as a human being like us. What was His quality? What was His attribute? How did He live? What was his life? The Bible says, ‘He was holy’.  \nJesus as a human being, when he came to His own and lived among us; He was holy, pure and undefiled. No defilement, no dirty thing was in Him; in life, in language, in actions. In everything, no dirty thing.  \nHe was undefiled. He was harmless not hurting people about, not rude, not proud and nothing that would make people to be harmed. He was harmless. That is how Jesus was. He was separated from sinners. He did not live like sinners. He did not share life with sinners. He did not live in sin with sinners. He lived a separated life, not like a drunkard a fornicator, a thief or a liar. He was totally separated from sin; pure and holy. That was His life. God wants to take us to this point of being pure, holy, undefiled, separate from sin and sinners. He wants to carry you to that point. He wants to bring you to that standard.    **\nWherefore, He is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him; seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them. Two things  His ability and His intercession to take you to that point. That you are pure, perfect, with no sin in your life. There is no defilement in your tongue, in your heart, in your body and in your nature. There is no defilement just like as He was. So, He is able to take you there. That is the vision you should see. That is the vision for purity and the vision for holiness. See it there. That is where God wants to take you. Are you seeing that tall tree over there? it is holiness, it is purity. God wants to take you to that tree. You will seat under that tree. He wants to carry you there. You will eat the fruits of that tree, it is the vision. That tree is your destination. That is where God wants to take you to. That is where He is.  \nSo you have seen the vision. Then believe in His ability to take you there because He is able. Forget about the infirmities of your bodies; forget about your natural weakness and your corrupt environment. Believe in Him that He is able to take you there. You have seen the vision, so believe in God.    **\nRelease yourself to Him to carry you there. He knows the way to take you there. You will eat the fruits of that tree. You will enjoy the shadow of that tree. You will enjoy the cool breeze under that tree. The Lord will take you to that point of Holiness.  His Intercession   \nThat is Grace. It is not your strength at this time but the supply of Grace. His prayer to God for you will supply the grace. You just believe. With the supply of grace, you will arrive at perfection. You will arrive at purity of heart. You will arrive at the holiness of life. God will help you. It is an instantaneous experience as soon as you ask for it in faith through prayer.    **\nWhen the Lord said to Ezekiel, Ezekiel 37 verse 3 “son of man, will these bones live;” because they were very dry, he knew how to answer God, “thou knowest”. Because with your eyes, you could be discouraged but since God has brought you there and shown you; don't go by your eyes. Faith! Thou knowest. You are able by His power and supply of grace. I can be pure. My heart will be pure. My life will be pure. I will live a holy life.    **\nHebrews 9 verse 13 to 14 says    **\n“ For the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh;\n How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?”  **\n  \nThe scripture is giving us assurance here. Before Jesus came, men who worshipped God lived by the purifying work of the blood of animals, goats, heifers etc. By the blood of animals as they offered sacrifice, animals were killed for men and they were forgiven in the past. Because the Bible says the soul that sinneth, it must die (Ezekiel 18 verse 20). And God bore that an animal could die instead of man so that the law should be fulfilled that sin is paid by death or paid with death (shading of blood as a type of Christ in Old Testament).  \nOnce a sin is committed, e.g. once a lie was told, in the record of God and in the dealing of God; in the telling of that lie, a life had to die for it. An animal had to die because a lie had been told. If one entered into the sin of sex; for that one art of immorality, an animal had to die for that immorality to be forgiven. Nothing but death could settle it. You could do it and say I am sorry but an animal had to die. You are sorry on the account that somebody have to die or would have to die for that sin to be forgiven you.  \nIn the Old Testament; before Jesus came, normally an animal has to die for each sin? If you have committed sin, an animal had to die. And by the death of the animal; God forgave sins, cleansed from sin and took the record of the sin away from your life because an animal had died. The Bible says “if the blood of animals could be considered by God” because an animal suffered for you; its suffering and death, could be considered by God to represent your death and so sin is overcome. How much more shall the blood of Christ which is higher than animal? How much more shall the death and suffering of Christ greater than animal, purer than animal; the blood of Christ who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge you? How much will this blood settle permanently the same problem in your life?    **\nHow much will the power of this blood purge sin from your consciences and settle the sin matter in your own life?  Therefore, have confidence in Christ. He can bring you to that perfection because of His blood; the superiority of His blood, His death for every life. Animals had to be dying regularly because men were sinning all the time. Some people would fall today, fall tomorrow. But Christ died once! What does it means. That He died once? It means He can bring you into the point of purity and you will remain there. You don't go back to sin anymore. He brings you to the point of purity. He purifies you to the point that you don't sin anymore. In First John 2 verse 1, the Bible says “My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not….” I write unto you that you should not sin. Why? He has died for you. Jesus is not dying every day. That means you should not be sinning every day.  \nAlthough the mercy of God is there for those who sin, He says ‘come back’. Jesus is still there. Look back to Him and restore yourself to perfect purity. Not that you should be sinning, No! The Bible says in First John 3 verse 9 that “Whosoever that is born of God doth not commit sin”. Why are you sinning? Does Christ need to be dying every day? No! You say “you know that we are imperfect Christians! God knows that we can be sinning every day!” These are words of people of the world, those who are yet to know Jesus deeply.   **\nDoes Christ die every day? No! Then why must you be sinning? He is able to save them to the uttermost. He is able to bring you to the perfection of life by that one death because of His blood; the blood of Christ. Have confidence in that blood. Believe it. There are people that have believed and are living daily in righteousness and Holiness. There are people that are living like that. Their lives are clean, holy and perfect. God has died for you once. By that once and only death, it means you come to Christ and get established in His purity. Your purity continues. That is what the word of God is telling us.   **\nEphesians 5 verse 25 to 27   **\n\n“ Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, \nThat he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.”  \nHusbands, love your wife, as Christ also loved the church.   **\n What is the church? It is a body of believers. As many that are born again; they are the church, members of His own body. How did they get born again? Because Christ died for the world; Christ died for sinners. They believed on the Lord Jesus and became born again. Being born again, they have become part of the church of Christ. The Bible tells us Christ died for the church and for the sinners.   **\n First Corinthians 15 verse 3    **\n\"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures\".    **\nHe died for sinners, for our sins according to scriptures.    **\n First   Timothy 1 verse 15   **\n\"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.”    **\nChrist came to save sinners. He died for our sins. He died for sinners. He died for the world. But in Ephesians 5 verse 25 to 27, He died for the church. What for? To purify the church, sanctify it and to present unto Himself a glorious church. It means the message of purity and holiness comes to the church.    **\nThe Message of repentance gets to the sinners in the world. When you go to the world, preach and say, “Repent of your sins and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ”. Now when you come to the church; He died for the church; for the holiness of the church. Then He tells the church; ‘‘submit yourself for the purification of your life’’. Purify your heart, sanctify your heart and submit yourself again to Christ.  \nAs the sinners believed on him to be saved from their sins, come to Christ and believe on him also for your purity so that He can give you uttermost salvation. He is able to save you to the uttermost. He can do cleansing in your life called \n‘sanctification’ and upgrade your life to a holy standard that you don't need to be sinning and say “sorry I have told a lie, sorry I do this, sorry I do this, etc”. No!  \nHe is bringing you to the state of continuous purity. He died for the church. He died for you who have believed already. The Gospel of heart purity comes to you and to the church, why? Though we have come to love Jesus, there are things we do as we live among one another. We do things that are bad. We still manifest some pride and we are still competing with one another. We are still angry against one another.  \nWe envy one another. You are singing in the choir but there is a struggle between you and your sister. You notice that there is some holiness in you but some little lies are still being told. Note that Sarah was not born again but when  \nSarah was challenged, she said; ‘No, I did not say such thing’. God said, ‘You said it, why are you lying?’ Was not Sarah a Godly woman? Godly but there were still lies.  All these impurities will go as you believe the Gospel of sanctification so that your heart comes to the higher level. \nThe Lord will strengthen that heart with Holiness. Amen!   **\nYou can now live the holy life. Some little stubbornness and rebellion that is seen in the church, you are always self-willed, very strong in your will even when things are not good  you say I am a leader! I am a Christian, if I preach, signs and wonders will follow, etc. But your life is not good enough. There is something you know that is not complete in your life.  \nChrist died for the church. You are part of that church. Christ died for the church to cleanse it. You need another cleansing work of Jesus to purify you. You need another purifying work of Jesus. The first one was done when you were taken from sin and cleansed to come to the church as a believer. Now you are a believer and you are in the church. Then the second one has to be done to pick you as a believer, cleanse you, sanctify you and then render you to the Holy life.  \nChrist died for sinners. He died for the world, the first provision of water; the water of regeneration. By it the sins of the sinner are washed. For ye are washed by the water of regeneration but then, Christ provided another water. He died for the church, for what? This is that other water  sanctification, inner purity. It is a second touch of purity which is also a second touch in Holiness and a second touch in righteousness that you might now be without spot or wrinkle or any such thing. Therefore, you now maintain the life of Holiness. If we now say let us go out for evangelism and preach to people, what do you tell them?  Repent and believe in Jesus; accept Jesus and your sins shall be forgiven and you will have a new life. Then, we will preach to you also, come to that same Jesus for the sanctification of your heart as you told the sinner to come for His repentance. As a Christian He died for you too, that you should be sanctified. Your heart should be purified in the first instance but it needs a second purification to bring you to that point in which you are without spot or wrinkle or any such thing.   **\nAs you flow in Holiness. Take note, He died for us once. He does not need to die daily. It means that you should come up to Holiness and continue in it. It is not for you to be Holy today and tomorrow you fall and say, ‘Jesus died again for me’. Please, No!!! Come to a standard life, one death is the provision. Christ can keep you in Holiness all the days of your life.   **\nLuke. 1 verse 74 to 75   **\n\" That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear, \n In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life”.   **\n  \nHe died once to achieve this. So why sin today and sin tomorrow? No! Don’t do that. All the days of our lives, consistency in righteousness is what God wants us to achieve Holiness and righteousness before God.  Before the world, even our preaching and our prayer is an offence. The world, your neighbor might see your preaching and say you are a wicked person. This is because you preach nothing but the hard truth which the people of the world would not comprehend. Removing jewelries and not painting again will make you an offense to your husband. So, you will not be an accepted person. Before him, you are an evil woman. But before God, who seeth the heart; He will see you through because of this work that Jesus has done in your life. He will see you Holy and righteous all the days of your life.   **\n \nChapter Three  Passion for Personal Purity   **\n \nNow that you have known the purity in Christ, how do you obtain it, that this thing should be real in your life?   **\nMatthew 5 verse 6      **\n\"Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled\".  \nHunger and thirst! Remember our passion. There is a force inside; a strong desire inside you looking for a state of purity and a heart of holiness that should be there. Let us see that passion, let us see that force, let us see you running, let us see you panting and let us see you weeping. Let us see you crying and longing; for you shall be filled. God will fill you and God will give you purity. He who sees your struggle will satisfy you and you shall be filled.    **\nPsalms 139 verse 23 to 24    **\n\"  Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me, and know my thoughts,\n And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting\".  **\n\n You see a man that does not want any wicked way in him. He will not take it. God, I cannot take away the wickedness in me, come and help me. How can I be manifesting pride? How can lie come out of my mouth? God search me, check me up and if there is anything in me, cleanse me from it, purge me. Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean. Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. If you wash me, I will be clean. If you purge me, I will be whiter than snow. Search my life and see if there is any wicked way in me and make me perfect. Can you see a man with a passion? This type of man will not live with anger. This type of a Christian will not allow anger to be in him. He must carry it to God and say it must not be there.  \nThis type of a Christian cannot allow lying lips. No. O, what did I say yesterday? O God, forgive me. Let it not repeat itself again. It must not. This type of Christian cannot allow lust! What, how did I feel, what happened? Not me again by His grace. God, this cannot be in my life. This kind of a Christian cannot allow pride. God, I did some performance before people and I am feeling high. What is causing that? I can't allow it to remain.  \nThis is the passion that is required to achieve purity. It’s because of this that you will go to God and give him no rest until he establishes you. Passion is the power inside and a strong desire. You will pray and pray till you arrive there.  I told you the vision of Holiness and purity as that tall tree you are seeing there. That is your destination. You need to eat the fruit of that tree. You need to be under the leaves of that tree and enjoy the shadow. But there are people that tell their congregation, ‘it is not possible’. No destination is set before them. You cannot achieve anything you don't have as a goal. But Jesus is ready to save to the uttermost. He is ready to take you over there; to the point of that vision He has set before us; to perfect us and to purge us, so that we can be pure.  \nDaniel had passion for purity and that was what made him to still maintain his purity in hard circumstance and hard environment.   **\nDaniel 1 verse 8   **\n\"But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.”   **\nPassion for purity will make you pure in the face of Nebuchadnezzar. It will make you pure in the face of a violent man. It will make you pure in the face of death because you are for purity of inner heart. You are so watching yourself that you will never allow sin. You are always checking every step you take as a believer. Have you seen a pussycat? When the pussycat runs from here to there, he will stop and lick his body. Every dust that has come upon him, he will lick it out. Even the very legs that touch the ground, he will lick it up and clean it. Have you seen those who are used to it like that, it worked for them.  Have passion for purity. You must check up yourself. Check up and lick up anything, anything that is sin in your body must be licked out. Passion! Daniel purposed in his heart. How do I keep anger and malice? Not me by His grace. It is not possible. I cannot allow it. I check myself.    **\nAfter I have spoken, and I watch, ‘did I speak evil, did any evil come out from there?’ How much more when I noticed that I spoke evil; that evil must not repeat itself.  \nPassion! The heart is made up. I must be pure. That is what God wants me to be. Make up your mind like that; that you must be pure. Examine yourself daily. Checkup yourself constantly in all manner of life. In the house, in marriage, in business place, in the church, in Christian ministry, in everything, checkup. Examine your attitude towards money; people; women and vis a vis vicissitudes of life. Check it up, don't allow it. Daniel purposed in his heart. Not even before men, not before armed robbers will you tell lies. You cannot. He that is born of God does not commit sin. He does not sin. He cannot sin. He is born of God.    **\nMake up your mind. You cannot sin before armed robbers. You can’t sin. You can’t tell lies because you want to escape. Escape from where, when you have God watching you? Make up your mind. Let not people see that you use lie to cover the truth about you, that is evil. Not possible. Daniel purposed in his heart. That is passion. In this way therefore, you have purity.    **\nActs 24 verse 16    **\n\"And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men\".    **\nI exercise purity and conscience. I exercise myself to maintain a pure conscience. Is there anything I’m not clear about, am I sinning here? Am I not sinning here, is there anything wrong? Take it to God in prayers until the light comes there. Always have a conscience void of offence. \nPure conscience!           **                                                        \n\nPurity and the Eyes    **\n \nPurity and Your eyes Job 31 verse 1 and 2   **\n\" I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? For what portion of God is there from above? And what inheritance of the Almighty from on high? \nI made a covenant with mine eyes. As I work on the street and I see the nakedness on the street; why will I be walking into the nakedness of a woman? What am I doing that for? What portion of God is there in a maid? Is it going to make me righteous, more righteous? Is it going to give me grace? For the Christian life and service, is it going to make me sing and bless God? What portion is there that I should be putting my eyes on and looking unto their nakedness? Never! I'm talking about the one with passion for purity. His eyes are regulated; he turns them away from beholding vanity like the dance. They are dancing disco there. These things they are dancing in the television and women dancing in nakedness, what pleasure do I derive there from? Which way do I receive anointing? Which way do I receive grace? If I fix my eyes on those boys, corrupt boys on the screen that are dancing with the corrupt girls (they are out there in pants, with their breasts exposed with their nakedness), should I take pleasure? It will corrupt my heart. \nThis is purity and the eyes.    **\n \n \n \nPurity and the Tongue   **\n \nJames. 1 verse 26   **\n\"If any man among you seems to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain\".  \nYou have grace, you have a gift and you have a calling, bridle and control your tongue; otherwise you are deceiving yourself that you are serving God. But you are performing vanity. That is what the scripture is saying. If any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue or controls it not; deceives himself.  \nFor in many things we offend all. The tongue is a little member but it is set on a fire of hell.    **\nJames 3 verse 2 to 6   **\n“ For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able to bridle the whole body.    **\nControl your speech and your tongue. Take care of what you say. There must be holiness in the tongue and purity in the tongue; if the tongue will be at rest.   **\n “ Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. \n Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth. \nEven so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! \n And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity, so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.’’  **\n The only story given in scripture for someone that was found alive in hell and recorded is the torment of the tongue. He did not talk about the eye, he did not talk about the mouth, and he did not even talk about the private part of that man which must have committed a lot of immorality but the tongue!  \nIt talks about the tongue that was passing through the fire of God; the fire of hell. The rich man in hell said; “send Lazarus that he might deep just a tip of water with his finger and cool my tongue”. Were not the eyes burning? The nostril consumed; the ears, private part, and the hairs of the head burning? But the tongue!  \nAnd God says, He is able to save you to that point in which you will not offend with your tongue. It is possible?  Our God is able and by His intercession and grace, it is going to work. It will work for us. He will bring you to that point in which you don't offend with your tongue. May the Lord do it for your life. Amen.   **\n \nPurity and the Ears   **\nTake care of what ye hear. The weight of a tale bearer does great evil. Turn away from the foolish man when thou perceive not in him the lips of knowledge. Be careful because that which you hear can provoke you to wrong action. Therefore, check the report well. Check who gives that report that they do not in turn defile your action and defile your life because what somebody may tell you of another may turn your loving heart to hatred against that person.   **\n \nPurity in the World   **\nJames 1 verse 27   **\n\"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\"    **\nTo be unspotted from the world and the activities of the world like the love of the world; association and friendship with the world. You should be careful where you work. In that office, let the activities of the world not overcome you. Be careful that you are not overcome with the love of money, the root of all evil.    **\n\nPurity and the Beauties in the World   **\nThe world is a world of beauty. Even the animals are beautiful. Men and women are beautiful. Be very careful that the beauty of the world does not carry you away. You don't go and be lusting after beauty. The Bible says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain. Beauty is vanity. Don't set your heart there. Money  When riches increase, set not your heart there. So be careful. Keep yourself pure. Don't go into wrong action because you need money.   **\n \n \n \nChapter Four  Passion for the Purity of others.   **\n \nIn passion for others’ purity, we want the purity of others.    **\nPsalms 12 verse 1    **\n“Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.”    **\nCan you see this man? This is a passionate man appealing for the purity of others. God’s purity is failing in the church. You can’t find holiness in the church any more. The godly man ceaseth. I am seeing corruption entering into the church, entering people and entering into godliness. The people are falling. The people are corrupting. Go to the churches and see how people dance. When we see the corrupt dances that are in the churches; we then, hold our stomach like a woman in labor.  \nGod's Righteousness has gone. The godly man has ceased. Can you do these things you are doing and still be holy? No! It is not possible! The two cannot go together. Pride has come into your body. Now, attention is in bodily demonstration. The drums have taken over the words of the songs. You are not even hearing the words of the songs any more. The people playing the drums don't have God in mind. They have you, how to entertain you, how to move your body, that is what is in their mind. The Godly man is crying that righteousness has died here. Help God, for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men. When we come to hear stories about some of these pastors, the immorality they do in their churches, the corruption, demonism employed in ministries, we cry.  Godliness has ceased. We are crying; God restore holiness; restore purity back to your people. That is our prayer and that is our cry. When we see the way people display zeal in wrong adornment, displaying zeal for God, zeal for evangelism, we cry. Lord rise up. Something is happening.   **\nThe people are robbing cream without taking bath. Day after day, they have not taking bath; they are only robbing cream. That is neither hygiene nor cleanliness. Help Lord for the godly man ceaseth. The faithful fails.  \nWe look from church to church. A particular lady said, in a divine revelation, the Lord took her from church to church, and in a big church to see how many righteous people were there? Two 2 Three 3! What happened to the others? The Godly man is ceasing. When you go to a place and find twenty godly people, by the time you come tomorrow, five is gone out of them remaining fifteen. Help Lord.  The Godly man ceaseth. The faithful ceaseth. They are getting too few among men in the society. The devil is swallowing up these people. The enemy is advancing. He is capturing towns and cities and is getting nearer to the headquarters. We cry for purity in the church.    **\nRomans 10 verse 1 to 3    **\n\" Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved. \n For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. \n For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God\".   **\n  \nMy heart desire and prayer to God is passion for others’ purity. This is your concern for the salvation of others and these other ministers who go on missions to the foreign lands but commit immorality there. They borrow money and never pay back. It is only the wicked that borrows and pays not again. They tell lies and falsify records. if you ask them how many people they have won, they will say three hundred when they have only gotten four 4 people. Righteousness has ceased. My cry is that they have zeal for God but not according to knowledge.  They are ignorant of Christ`s righteousness. They think suffering like going to the forest, donating for the work of God and doing many good works makes one pure and holy. The Bible says, though ye give yourself to be burned and have no charity, it profited you nothing.   First Corinthians 13 verse 3. If I even give in service, in sacrifice, in giving; but no holiness, purity and righteousness, it profiteth me nothing. Yet great work is going on.  \nOne man can build a whole church yet no righteousness in him. He is having the second wife with him. O Lord, I am crying. My heart’s desire is that these churches should come to the knowledge of truth. Otherwise, the wicked shall be turned to hell and all churches that forget God. All churches that don't know His Holiness shall be turned to hell.    **\nThey started well, taught these people well but eventually, corruption entered into it and they have lost their reward. Their righteousness shall never be remembered. Their services shall never be remembered. All the sacrifices, the persecution they face in life shall never be remembered. For the iniquity they have allowed into their congregation, for that iniquity they shall die. Take every step required to recover them. Take every step required to recover them because God is not a respecter of any persons. When Moses did a thing not worthy of entering the Promised Land, God told Moses “you are not entering there”. God is not a respecter of persons. And the Bible says “better is the end of a thing than the beginning of it” (Ecclesiastes 7 verse 8). Why are these men ending this way? Why is this glorious church ending this way? And the end is better than the beginning. All the history you have made. All the records you have made will become vanity. That is why we struggle passionately to make others righteous, recover them and bring them back to the truth.    **\nRomans 9 verse 1 to 4 shows that these people have the scripture. They are not people of other religions. They are not pagans and they are not Muslims. They are having the scripture, they have come to the point they can read. They have theological schools. What has happened to them, why have they become so ignorant?  \nWhen I lie down I pant. What happens? Why have you come to that point and yet to have this understanding you cannot; do you get this knowledge to perfect your work for presentation? How do you present to God that which is not perfect? That He might present to Himself a glorious church without spot or wrinkle. Your cloth is already okay but there is something there that needs just to be removed. You cannot be presented to God. I feel bad. For this reason, I wish that I myself could be accursed, let them come in. What has brought them to this blindness? We are wishing them; we are laboring, fasting and praying to God to open their eyes.  \nElisha prayed for his servant and God opened his eyes that he might see the host of angels so that he will stop being afraid. And the Lord opened the eyes of the servant and when he saw that indeed divinity is around them, he became quiet. Let God open their eyes. That is the prayer we pray. This is passion for others’ purity.    **\nWe cannot even talk about these other ones who have gone into other religions; the Muslims and others who are out of the way completely. We can talk about the Idol worshippers around us and our relations. What do we do for them that they should come because there is no other way? Jesus is the way, the only way. There is no other name given under heaven or among men that we should be saved. We are thinking about the lost, should we be thinking about you, who have gotten the Bible already? You who can read the Bible? Who have the mind to think? Who have gotten salvation? Just for you to embrace Holiness, perfecting and cleansing of your life; so that you can be presentable unto God and you are arguing, you are ignorant? yet you are moving on. You will not make heaven. You are not going to enter there. Heaven is for the Holy and perfect Christians. Yes this is real passion for other's purity.    **\nColossians 1 verse 28 to 29    **\n“Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus; \n Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.”   **\n Can you see Him working? He works in me mightily. I'm resting. I'm laboring. What is my labor in preaching and warning? What for? The reason is that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. That is what we are doing; we want to perfect the people. There is restlessness in us. There is a passion in us.  \nWe are thinking how do we get the catholic people know that this Hail Mary prayer is the business of hell? How do we let them know? How do we get PFN to come to know that all dirty worship of jumping up and singing have no righteousness in them? How do we get the white garment church to come to know that there is need for them to know Jesus? This is done by telling them that they should remove all these things and be filled with the Holy Ghost and serve this God holily and righteously inside and outside. How do we get those ministers know that they need to purify themselves and add the Gospel of Holiness? This is by letting them know that the Gospel of purity into preaching to cause their members to be purified, holy and Righteous. Adornment should be godly, the jewelries should be removed. Worldliness, perming, attachment should be cleared out. They should preach this Gospel. We are laboring passionately. We are laboring; else there is no heavenly inheritance.    **\nA woman inherited her mother's ministry given by God. The mother was a prophetess and had died December, 2012. The int’l Director of Holiness Revival Movement worldwide was invited through the daughter who took over from the mother after her burial at the age of 90. This woman’s daughter learnt how to preach Holiness from him. She learnt how to remove earrings, jewels, attachment, etc., when she got and read the int’l director's books and her eyes opened. The mother had been a prophetess for 56 years. When the daughter got this message according to the story, they have a prayer camp which is a very large place. They built it and have crowds of people there.  \nThe mother always gathered people for program and miracles had been done by the mother. When she gathered them like that and preached to the people; the daughter would collect the microphone and tell them that with all these things my mother had told you people, if she did not remove the earrings in her ear, she was not going to heaven. The mother would be hearing her. If you didn't remove this ring in your hand, chain on your neck, attachment, weave-on, etc, you were not going to heaven. With all these things my mother was telling you people; if she did not remove all these jewelries, she would not see heaven. At the end, the mother listened to her daughter and removed them all and became clean. Not long after, she died.  \nClear revelation showed her in heaven. The Lord also spoke through one of the sisters and said now you were the instrument that made your mother to make heaven. Your mother now is in heaven. Someone also had a vision that this woman is in heaven and that said it was my daughter, they saw her with a white apparel or garment. She said my daughter gave me this. My daughter enabled me to be here. She preached it with passion. Else; the 56 years’ labor of the mother would have been a waste. Many things are going into waste in our time. Many labours are being wasted except they are perfected. How much does it take to remove the rings, earrings, wedding rings, engagement rings, chain, attachment, painting, and the ungodly hairdo? \nNothing!  \nYou are already a Christian. God hears your prayers and others are healed. Yes, because of service. But for your life, you will not go there because nothing that defiles shall enter there. So, this is the passion; passion for purity in Christ. Have passion for your personal purity. Have passion for the purity of others. Labor, work and find yourself in heaven.  God bless you.  \n\n",

And the angel departed from her.   **\nBy this book, God will grant you the grace to know and understand Mary. Will need to know about her as a separate. This is because HER Son, Jesus Christ and understand about her because her Son, Jesus Christ, was so great and over shadowed her so much that many don't consider or remember the qualities of the woman called Mary. Even though all our attention in life is to the Lord Jesus which is actually what matters, we should also know that there are things to learn from Bible characters and saints of old. Some, who are for Jesus, completely forget Mary. Some even think that Mary could have been a sinner at the time the choice of God came to her, when the angel appeared to her. Mary was a saint at this time, not a sinner. She was godly and righteous.   **\n Luke 1 verse 46 to 50   **\n 46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. 48 For He hath regarded the low estate of His handmaiden  for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. \n49 For He that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is His name. 50 And His mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation.  \n51 He hath shewed strength with His arm; He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts. 52 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree. 53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich He hath sent empty away. \n54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; 55 As He spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed forever. \n56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.   **\n On the other hand, some people demonically take it far. The heathen and idol worshippers that worship goddesses turn Mary into a goddess and forget the main person  Jesus Christ. They call her, 'The Mother Of God'. Those ones do so after the spirit of paganism and idolatry. It is unfortunate that the major part of the church today belongs to this idolatrous worship of Mary.   **\nActs 10 verse 25 to 26   **\n25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him. \n26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man. They equate Mary with God and see her greater than all human beings, because she was chosen to give birth to Jesus.   **\nActs 14 verse 8 to 17    **\n8 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's womb, who never had walked  9 The same heard Paul speak  who steadfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed, \n10 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked. \n11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. \n12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. \n13 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. 14 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, \n15 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein  \n16 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways. \n17 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.    **\nNow we can see the two sides of the coin. This book will seek to focus on Mary with particular message to every Christian woman. What qualities of life did Mary, the woman that was chosen to give birth to Jesus, have? Is God careless in His choice? Are there things to be emulated in the life of Mary? You will see in this book that Mary the mother of Jesus was as human as any other person on earth is. She was not an extra human being as some erroneously thought. In fact the bible refer to her as the mother of faith. The Bible exalted Sarah, the wife of Abraham, as the mother of faith which all women including Mary were to emulate.   **\nFirst Peter 3 verse 3 to 6   **\n 3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel? \n4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. \n5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands  \n6 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.   **\nIt was God`s choice to make Mary prominent and not Joseph, the husband, hence, the scripture did not give much narrative on Joseph her husband. The scripture sufficiently portrayed her holiness, godly vision, passion for God and industry in child –training. God expects all women to be holy in Character, in dressing and in the service of God and to submit to their husbands in the will of God.  **\n\nCHAPTER ONE    **\nGODLY QUALITIES IN MARY   **\n1.1 Who Was Mary?   **\n Luke. 1 verse 28   **\n28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee  blessed art thou among women.   **\n Mary, the mother of Jesus after the flesh, was addressed as a highly favored woman; one blessed among women. This salutation does not portray her as the best or the greatest woman among the women of the earth. However, it showed that she possessed good qualities of life that fitted her for God's choice and calling which she received. These are qualities that every righteous woman should emulate. Your eyes will be opened as you read this book. It is time for end-time revival and the Lord wants women of these qualities to arise among His daughters. He wants women who will be able to present to the world what Mary presented to the world  Jesus has been the saviour of the world. Know that Jesus had existed as God the creator of all things and every one including Mary. As children of Adam, the parents of Mary were born in sin. They conceived her in sin and gave birth to her as a sinner as every child of Adam. As a sinner she needed the salvation of God from her sin. She trusted in God who saved her and made her righteous. God is saviour to all who call on him. Scriptural examination shows that Mary possessed the following qualities    **\n1.2  She was made righteous by God.    **\nMary was saved from sin and made righteous. God was her Lord and Saviour. She walked with God in righteousness.   **\nLuke. 1 verse 46, 47   **\n46 And Mary said, my soul doth magnify the Lord, 47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.    **\n Mary knew the Lord. Before the angel met with her, she was a woman that served God in righteousness. It was not a careless choice  the woman that gave birth to Jesus was not a careless woman. She was not a sinner.   **\n1.3 She Was Holy, Pure and Clean    **\nShe maintained purity and holiness in heart and life. Scriptural account on her before her visitation of the angel attests to this.   **\nLuke. 1 verse 26, 27, 34   **\n26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, \n27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. \n34 Then said Mary unto the angel, how shall this be, seeing I know not a man?   **\nMary kept virginity. She was not a careless woman exposed to immorality. She was not carelessly exposed to young men, not even to the one that proposed to marry her. She was not the type that could entice her fiancé to sleep with her. Never! She was not the type that her fiancé would touch, press her and lie with her on the bed. She was a clean woman. That is the vessel God uses! The vessel God uses is a vessel unto honour. Mary was a vessel unto honour. When the angel saw her, he shouted in salutation because she had kept herself in the ways of God and in His righteousness.   **\nSecond Timothy 2 verse 19 to 21   **\n 19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.\n 20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. \n21 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.  **\nThe Angel said, “The Lord is with you!” That is because the Lord is with the righteous, godly and holy. Mary, in her righteousness and holiness attracted God's attention and so the Lord brought special favor to her life. All through generations till now the Catholics who adore Mary maintain a portrait of Mary’s clothing and adornment devoid of Jewelry. I heard of an occasion which someone made a portrait of Mary wearing jewelry and the Catholics went wild worldwide against it. This is because godly women in Bible times never used jewelry or any kind of ungodly adornment.   **\nFirst Peter 3 verse 3 to 5   **\n3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel? 4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. \n5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands    **\n1.4 She Was a Woman Of Faith In God    **\nLuke. 1 verse 38, 45     **\n38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her. \n45 And blessed is she that believed  for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.   **\nCan you see the difference between Mary and Zacharias, the priest? Both had angelic visitation and promise that came from God. But one doubted and the other believed God.   **\nHere is how it went with Zacharias.   **\nLuke. 1 verse 11 to 13, 18 to 20   **\n11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. \n12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him. 13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias;  for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John. \n18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. \n19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings. \n20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.    **\nWhen the angel told him that his wife would give birth to a son and that he would call the child's name John, Zacharias doubted in his heart. Zacharias had a wife and as such, conception could easily occur, yet he doubted. Hence, the angel declared that he would be dumb until the fulfilment. But see the difference with Mary. She had no husband and was not sleeping with anyone. When the angel told her what was more difficult, she only asked how it would happen considering her marital status. And the moment the angel told her it was going to be an act of God; she yielded and believed. Let every woman believe God`s word and promises.   **\nJohn 11 verse 39, 40, 43, 44.   **\n39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto Him, Lord, by this time he stinketh,  for he hath been dead four days. \n40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? 43 And when He thus had spoken, He cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. \n44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.    **\nThe Lord has called you to be a believer, not a doubter. Believe what God tells you. That was how Mary behaved. Remember, in the first miracle of Jesus, when the people wanted wine. She came to Jesus and with full faith in Him and said, “They have no wine.” The people God uses were people of faith, for without faith, it is impossible to please God…he that cometh to God must believe…(Heb. 11 6) Then she went back to the disciples and said, “Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it.” That is a woman of faith. You who are full of complaints and doubt, cannot please God. To be a vessel unto honour, you must be a woman of faith. Look at what was said of this woman of faith     **\nLuke. 1 verse 39 to 45    **\n39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; 40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.\n41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost  \n42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. 43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? \n44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. \n45 And blessed is she that believed  for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.   **\n'There shall be a performance ` This means at this time, the pregnancy had not yet come, but by faith, since God had spoken, it would come. 'Shall be' means it had not been performed yet. But because she had believed, it was going to happen. Are there women of faith after the pattern of Mary? Are there women that believe the Lord shall perform the thing they are praying for? Are there people that believe that the promises of God that have been poured upon them shall come to pass in their lives? Are there people that believe that the anointing of the Holy Ghost shall come upon them and the Lord shall transform them to become preachers of this gospel? Are there people that believe that the Lord shall raise them up to become evangelists, missionaries, teachers, musicians, and do other greater works to promote this gospel and spread revival to the whole world? Do you believe? If you do, there shall be a performance!    **\n Mark 9 verse 23    **\nJesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth.   ** \nFirst Thessalonians 2 verse 13   **\n For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.   **\nBelieve that what God has told you will come to pass.    **\n1.5 She Was A Humble Woman Of God    **\nThe woman the Lord chose was really worthy to walk with the Lord, because she was of a humble and contrite spirit.    **\nLuke. 1 verse 39 to 45    **\n39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda; \n40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. 41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost  \n42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb. \n43 And whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? \n44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy. \n45 And blessed is she that believed  for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.    **\n If some of these women today have such great exaltation and gift of grace like Mary, how will they behave? If Mary was like some of these pastors' wives that receive grace to be exalted to a position of authority or invested with gifts, having women at her command, she would be humble. She would feel the least among women, but many women in high position walk as though they are suspended in the air. “I am a great woman”. That is the behaviour of some people, but not Mary. She was very humble. The promise of God never changed her character or promoted her above her husband. She was still going to be subject to her husband. The gifts and callings of God should not be for your pride. Do not ever raise your shoulder if the Lord brings you to leadership over women. Never exalt yourself in your heart above others, that is a lifestyle God hates! A proud look is an abomination unto the Lord. That you sit in the church with the air of authority, saying “I am great” woman, I am the women leader here, I am the pastor's wife” That was not who Mary was! Oh Lord, change these sisters and cause them to be like Mary. My God, put the spirit of Mary upon these women. Oh God help their hearts to be humble in their churches, states and nations. Wherever you are, may the brokenness and humility of Mary possess your life oh daughter of God! \nThe gifts and calling of God should not make you proud and bossy. You must deal in humility. See what Jesus said.    **\nMatthew 23 verse 11    **\n11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant. That is the heart you should possess.    **\nPhilippians 2 verse 5 to 8    **\n5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus  6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God  \n7 But made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men  \n8 And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. God says, humble yourself–that was the character of Mary–then I will exalt you.    **\n First Peter 5 verse 6    **\n6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time  \n15 We shall see more qualities of humility in the life of Mary in the following Scripture.    **\nLuke 2 verse 6, 7    **\n6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. \n7And she brought forth her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.    **\n Begin to worship God and thank God for the woman called Mary. This is great and wonderful! That is what God wants to put in your heart and life. Can you see that the woman that was promised that she would give birth to the Highest came into Bethlehem at about the time of delivery and there was no place for them because the hotel rooms were filled? The Lord wants to go with you to the place of humility. The Lord wants you to humble yourself because if you are conscious of the pride of this world, you will never reach where He wants to take you. If you are conscious of your personality or you attach earthly glory to your life, you will never reach God`s place. The Lord was taking the lowest place of the universe, the lowest place of the earth! He was going to be born in the house of animals where sheep were kept. He was going to be laid in the manger used to feed those animals. The Lord wanted to go down to that point of humility because He was coming to break the pride of the world. And He needed a woman that would cooperate and go with Him right to the depth of humility. Where is that woman today that the Lord will take to the depth of humility? The depth of humility  all glory gone, all greatness gone, all these high and mightiness in you, dead! I tell you surely, no woman reading this book could have ever put her child in a manger, but Mary did it! She did it because the Lord wanted it so. That is the woman the Lord wants now!    **\n Proverbs 31 verse 10   **\nWho can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies.    **\n But sadly, many women are too proud to be used! They are too heady, that's why there is always problem. You are looking for honour from women; you are demanding honour that is why you cannot be used. That is why you cannot go further!    **\n1.6 She Was Submissive To Suffering In The Will Of God    **\nLuke. 2 verse 34 to 36    **\n34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary His mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; \n35 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. \n36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser  she was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity.    **\nSuffering was attached to being the mother of Jesus. Take note that Simeon was not talking to Joseph. He said unto Mary. The Lord came to suffer, and He needed a woman that would agree to suffer along with Him. He wanted a woman that would go with Him to the region of suffering, and the woman with that quality was Mary. That quality to bear shame, disgrace and abuse is an earthly quality that was found in Mary. Do you think it was only Jesus they were abusing? As they abused Jesus, they abused Mary too. Many would have challenged her.\n “Why did you give birth to a person that is claiming He is God? They would have taunted her in many ways. God wants women that are ready to suffer along with their husbands in all ways.    **\nPhilippians 1 verse 29    **\nFor unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on Him, but also to suffer for His sake.    **\n‘A sword shall pierce through thy own soul also…' But for you, any little thing that touches you, makes you shout. Any little abuse makes you shout; you are ready to fight it. That's not the woman the Lord is looking for; it was not the type of woman that gave birth to Him. That was not the type of woman He chose for divine service and memorial.    **\nMatthew 2 verse 13 to 15    **\n13  And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and His mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word  for Herod will seek the young child to destroy Him. \n 14 When he arose, he took the young child and His mother by night, and departed into Egypt  \n15 And was there until the death of Herod; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have i called My Son.   **\nShe was the mother of a persecuted child, the mother of a child the devil was seeking after with all his might. That was who Mary was  rising up in the night and trekking a great distance from Bethlehem all the way to Egypt. She went all the way, but if you were the one you might have complained. This is particularly to you who complain over little things. Little suffering at home, you complain. That is not the kind of woman God is looking for. It is a woman that will identify with God in His suffering.    **\nPhilippians 3 verse 10   **\nThat I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable unto His death.    **\n Mary was not full of murmurings and complains. But little things make you complain and murmur. A little lack at home makes you weary your husband with murmurings. Your complaints are like the rain drops from morning till evening. You make the house unbearable.    **\nPhilippians 2 verse 14 to 16   **\n14 Do all things without murmurings and disputing  15 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; \n16 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.   **\nThe Lord is telling you, “woman, come back, take on this glory. Take on this quality. It is the quality that will make you useful in the hand of the Lord in this end-time and forevermore.”   **\n1.7 She Was A Loving And Caring Mother    **\nThere was love in her heart. She was not a carefree woman. She looked well and cared much. If you come across Mary, then you would see beauty of care, love and gentleness.    **\n Luke 2 verse 41 to 48    **\n41 Now His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. \n42 And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. \n43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and His mother knew not of it.\n44 But they, supposing Him to have been in the company, went a day's journey; and they sought Him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.\n45 And when they found Him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking Him. \n46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. \n47 And all that heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers. \n48 And when they saw Him, they were amazed, and His mother said unto Him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, Thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.   **\nI want you to see this caring mother  concerned yet under control. She was caring and compassionate. She had control of her emotions and her tongue. They had spent a day looking for Jesus among the people. When they did not find Him there, they took a day's journey back to Jerusalem and spent three days looking for Him. If it were you, may be you would have forgotten all the promises of God over the child and all your thoughts would be on how to deal with the child when you see him. When the child was found, did you see a woman burning with anger? No. I am talking about the qualities of this woman you call Mary, the mother of Jesus. We actually do not bother about her because it is Jesus that will take us to heaven and not her. But there is something in this woman that you need so that you too can be chosen of God and used, for there are yet great things you are to do for Him in this life. There are yet great things that God has designated women to do for Him in this life.    **\n second Timothy 2 verse 19 to 21    **\n19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are His. And, Let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity. \n20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour. \n21 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.   **\nSee the character of this woman; the care, the concern to look for her child. She spent days searching and when the child was found, she had control of emotion in speaking with her child. “Child, we have been looking for you. Why did you keep us like that?” And the reply of the child, Jesus was in a way that if you were the mother you would have got loosed on Him “You are asking me why I am looking for you?” Learn to be under control. Learn to bring your emotions under control, because the injury you are causing your children pains God. Many times you beat those children when they should not be beaten. You beat them just because of your person or the anger in your heart. The way you treat those children God gave you pains Him. Many of them have injuries in their eyes because of you. Many have some burns on their body because of you. For some, you just pushed them to hit anything. On others, you even threw live coals from the fire at them. On some, you pour hot water on the child. Can you see the disparity between you and Mary, a woman of like passion as you are? Can you see the great gap between you and Mary? Why are you looking for God to use you when you are like this?   **\n 1.8 She Was A Woman Of Spiritual Understanding   **\n Her heart was towards God to understand more. She gained understanding through meditation on the word and ways of God, the lifestyle and the activities of her Son Jesus Christ.    **\n Luke  2 verse 51    **\n51 And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them  but His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.  \n All that God had said and all that happened to her son were kept in her heart.   **\n Psalm 119 verse 11    **\n11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. May God gives you understanding of His ways and work in your life and through your life.   **\nColossians 1 verse 8 to 11    **\n8 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit? 9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;\n10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; \n11 Strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness.    **\n1.9 She Was A Woman Of Inspiration    **\nMary was so interested in her son. She wanted Him to do something for God. She was an inspirer. Do you know that the first miracle Jesus performed came through Mary; the miracle that opened the door to Jesus' supernatural ministry was caused by Mary. She was interested in her son, and going with Him to wedding where He was invited.    **\nJohn. 2 verse 1 to 5   **\n1 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there  2 And both Jesus was called, and His disciples, to the marriage. \n3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto Him, They have no wine. 4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? Mine hour is not yet come. \n5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever He saith unto you, do it.    **\nWho gathered the servants before Jesus? It was Mary. She trusted and believed in Jesus. She believed in the powers that were embedded in Jesus and was willing to  provoke them to action. Immediately she said, “They have no wine,” she quickly went to gather servants to tell them to obey Jesus. Jesus had to get charged and He started performing miracles. That was a good woman, an inspirer; one that would inspire people to serve the Lord. That was Mary and that is the quality God will want in your life.    **\nHebrew 10 verse 24   **\nAnd let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works    **\n Mary provoked her son to good works to the glory of God. Do so too. \n1.10 Mary Identified With the Pains Of God Over Humanity   **\nShe never at any time ran away or hid herself  she followed on. With all the persecution against her Son, she went along with Him, even to the crucifixion. Even when they crucified Him and many of His disciples ran away, she stood there. I trust it was because she stood there that her friends and others joined her, watching her Son in pain. Was she laughing? Was she discussing? She was rather weeping.   **\nJohn. 19 verse 25    **\n25 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.    **\n\nCHAPTER TWO   **\nMARY  WISE AND VISIONARY CHILD TRAINER    **\n2.1 Mary Gave Birth to Other Children    **\nYou could say, “What part did she have to play in the upbringing of Jesus, being God and Creator, the Perfect One? What part?” Well, let's keep that of Jesus aside. Mary had other children. Let us see Mary in other children  what she did to raise up great preachers for the world.    **\nProverbs 31 verse 25 to 31    **\n25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come. \n26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness. 27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. \n28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her. 29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. \n30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain  but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. \n31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.    **\nI want you to know that this woman, Mary, had other children after Jesus, there should have been at least six other children after Jesus.   **\nMatthew. 13 verse 53 to 56    **\n53 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, He departed thence. \n54 And when He was come into His own country, He taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, whence hath this Man this wisdom, and these mighty works? \n55 Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? \n56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this Man all these things?    **\nFrom this scripture, we can see that Mary had four sons and at least two daughters. These children had natural birth and were born in sin even as any other child in the world. These children were born by Mary's intimacy with Joseph her husband and would say as the Psalmist “behold I was sharpen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceived me.”    **\nRomans 3 verse 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. \nAll in the world who were born through sexual relationship between a man and a woman were born in sin.   **\n 2.2 Mary`s Children Were Sinners At Birth as You    **\nThe coming of Jesus out of the womb of Mary did not wash that womb from sin. Her womb could still produce sinners. Why? That is the normal law. Jesus' case was that the law was set aside for Him, being God that was coming out. The blood of her husband did not mix with hers to produce Jesus. The seed was not produced by Joseph. But as long as the other children were to be formed by the natural copulation of male and female as man and his wife, the children will be sinners. Hence, all these six children were sinners. They grew up ungodly like other children. They did not believe in Jesus when He was on the earth with them. I suppose that some of them would have been as stubborn as your own children, because they were sinners. Some would have had some peculiar traits as your child, perhaps, but Mary worked on them.    **\nJohn 7 verse 3 to 5    **\n3 His brethren therefore said unto Him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. \n4 For there is no man that doeth anything in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. \n5 For neither did His brethren believe in Him.    **\nAll the other children of Mary were sinners, but they had a mother that was to turn them to righteousness and present them to God. They had a mother that would work on them, and bring righteousness out of them. More than that, she would make them ministers of the gospel, ministers that would contribute to the salvation of the whole world. And the name of their mother was Mary.    **\nFirst Timothy 1 verse 5 to 6    **\n5 Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day. \n6 But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.    **\nIt also appears that from the scriptural silence over Joseph towards the beginning of Jesus' ministry, Joseph might have died, leaving Mary alone to take care of the children. This is believed to be the case because the Bible said nothing anymore about Joseph, from when Jesus was 12 years old, till he got into the ministry at 30 and finished the ministry. Even till the Acts of the Apostles, nothing was said about Joseph. Hence, it is assumed that he would have died. It would therefore mean that six children or more were under the care of one woman, and she was not a superwoman. She was a woman ordinary as you are, but dedicated to God. She was passionate about Jesus. She was a woman as you are  I do not know if she was tall, short, fat or slim.. Who knows if she looked just like you?    **\nTitus 2 verse 4 to 5    **\n4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, \n5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.    **\nJames 5 verse 17 to 18    **\n17 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.\n18 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.   ** \nMay God help you to train your children for Him?   **\n 2.3 Mary Worked On Her Unbelieving Children   **\nProverbs 22 verse 6 Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.  **\nMary had a sister, Mary, the wife of Cleophas. So, it is clear that she was a human as you are and not an angel created in heaven. But this woman worked upon her unbelieving children till we got biblical records that some became great and renowned preachers who wrote part of the Bible, as James and Jude.   **\nSecond John 1 verse 4   **\nI rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.    **\nGod did not give her children automatic repentance just because they came from the same womb with Jesus. The fact that you are a pastor's wife does not mean that your children should automatically repent. You must work on them. Mary worked on her own children. The fact that Jesus the very God, was in the family for thirty three years and a half, did not mean the children would be automatically converted. They could see the miracles did they not know that Jesus had disciples? They were mocking at Him as seen in our text. Nonetheless, Mary took it up with God and worked on them until they changed, became righteous and godly. It was the work of Mary!   **\nProverbs 11 verse 30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.    **\nLearn from Mary. Do not be lazy over your children. Do not fold your hands over your children. Do not allow them go to hell. God is looking for your children. Present them a living sacrifice unto Him. Let the anointing of God fall on them to make them great preachers that will bring revival to the world in this end-time. Work on both your male and female children, whatever is their number. Learn from Mary.   **\n Romans 15 verse 4 to 5   **\n4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope. \n5 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus.   **\n2.4 Mary Was A Disciple Of Christ    **\nMary followed Jesus consistently all through until He died. She continued until she also died.   **\n Act. 1 verse 12 to 14    **\n12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey. \n13 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. \n14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.    **\nGive glory to God! The brethren of Jesus had come in now. Mary had worked on them. Hallelujah! They had believed! That woman had worked on them.   **\n Psalm 126 verse 5 to 6   **\n5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. 6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.    **\nLet me give you a glimpse of one of the things Mary did to bring the brethren of Jesus, her children, into Christ,. She gathered her children to the campaign of Jesus. She wanted to make them know that they were not to see the Lord as a brother. She wanted them to see Him as their Lord and personal Saviour. That was how she worked on them.   **\nMatthew 12 verse 46 to 50    **\n46 While He yet talked to the people, behold, His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to speak with Him. \n47 Then one said unto Him, Behold, Thy mother and Thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with Thee. 48 But He answered and said unto him that told Him, Who is my mother? And who are my brethren? \n49 And He stretched forth His hand toward His disciples, and said, behold my mother and my brethren! \n50 For whosoever shall do the will of My Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.    **\n2.5 Mary Brought Her Children to the Campaign of Jesus   **\n Mary brought her children to hear the bitter truths of life. “Go and hear Him! If you are boasting after the flesh and refuse to comply and believe, you will be lost, damned! Do not ever boast that you were born from the same womb with Jesus  He is the Lord, the God of life, go and learn for yourself.”   **\nPhilippians 3 verse 3 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.   **\n Mary worked on those children until after the death of Jesus or at whatever time, the children all came into christ. May God grant your children, all of them, the salvation of the Lord? May the Lord create a place in heaven for your family, that your children shall all make it to heaven in Jesus' name! The God that did it for Mary will do it for you. The God that changed the children of Mary, about six of them, shall change yours!    **\n Isaiah 54 verse 13 And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great shall be the peace of thy children.    **\n2.6 Believe that your Children Will Change.    **\nRomans 4 verse 17 to 22.    **\n17 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were. \n18 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, so shall thy seed be. \n19 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara's womb  \n20 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; 21 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform. \n22 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.    **\nMary was a woman of faith. Whatever contrary behaviour she was seeing in her children never moved her. “I have tabled your case before the Lord, and as far as I'm concerned, that demon must bow! Witchcraft can never work in my child, occultism can never work in my child. The fire of the Holy Ghost will burn them down! My child shall be free!” Your child shall be free!    **\n Second Corinthians 4 verse 13   **\nWe having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak.   **\n God will do it for you. He did it for Mary, but she worked. Arise and work! Two of her children, James and Jude, became great preachers and apostles and great writers of the Bible. We will see the confession of those children when their eyes opened. The eyes of your children shall open!   **\n James 1 verse 1    **\n James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.   **\nCan you receive his greetings? Receive the greetings of James. One of the sons of Mary is greeting us. I bring greetings from one of the sons of Mary. But what did he say? He said he was a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was not worthy to call Jesus his brother, never! His eyes had opened. He had come to  understand that it was the Lord Himself that was in their house. Mary knew it much earlier, but they did not. She laboured on them until their eyes got opened to know it too.    **\nLuke 24 verse 31. And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him; and He vanished out of their sight.   **\nLet us look at the second person, Jude, another son of Mary. He wanted to connect himself to James, but not to Jesus, because Jesus was his Lord and Saviour. He could not connect himself to Jesus carnally just because they came from the same womb.    **\nJude 1 verse 1 to 2.    **\n1 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, and called  \n2 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.   **\n Hallelujah! Give applause to Mary  what a wonder that she brought up these godly children! She laboured on them. Go and labour on your children. If you are not married, get ready to labour on your children as the Lord gives them to you. Children teachers, get ready to labour on these children and raise up great preachers for endtime revival.    **\nProverbs 24 verse 30 to 34    **\n30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; \n31 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.\n32 Then I saw, and considered it well; I looked upon it, and received instruction. 33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep  \n34 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man?   ** \n\nCHAPTER THREE    **\nWANTED  A MOTHER OF END-TIME REVIVALISTS     **\n 3.1 You Can Be Like Mary    **\nThe Lord is looking for you now woman. He has shown you Mary to emulate. You now understand who she was. Now, He is looking for you to use you as a portrait of a holy woman in this end-time and to raise great end-time Christian leaders and preachers for Him.    **\nFirst Timothy 2 verse 7, 10,    **\n 7 Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not ;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. \n10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.    **\nFirst Timothy 4 verse 12    **\nLet no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.    **\nThe Lord said we should ask, is there any woman that wants to give Him children, so He can use them to recover the church and the world? Is there any woman willing? Can we find a woman that has these qualities of Mary that can produce children for end-time revival? In the Old Testament, there is a woman that resembled Mary. I told you the quality is not limited to Mary, they are all human qualities. Look at that woman, Hannah.    **\n First Samuel 1 verse 9 to 19, 26 to 28    **\n9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD. \n10 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore. \n11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.\n12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. \n13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard  therefore, Eli thought she had been drunken.\n 14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee. \n15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit  I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. \n16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial,  for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. \n17 Then Eli answered and said, go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. \n18 And she said, let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no sadder. \n19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her. \n26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. 27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him  \n28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.   **\n 3.2 Woman, Present That Child to God    **\nHave you understood, woman? This scripture shall be fulfilled in your life? Woman of faith, you had better catch this scripture. The Lord is looking for you. Can you give your child to Him? Can you work on that child and present to the Lord? If you do not have a child, can you believe God for one so you will give God for end-time revival? can you train one for God? If the world will delay for 10 more years, your children should play a gospel part in this world. If the world should delay for 20 years or even 30 more years that your child should have the opportunity to be mature to do exploits for God! Holiness must spread. The mouth of your child shall contribute to it. Your child shall write anointed books. Your child shall sing songs of salvation. This should be your commitment. You are going to make a commitment to God, thus, “Lord, my child shall serve you well.” For you that do not have a child and have passed the age of childbearing or you do not even have a husband, you will tell God thus, “Lord, can you by your mercy, bring a child my way? It may be someone's child, but I want to raise the child up for you. Let me raise up somebody that will contribute to the revival of the world.” Amen.   **\nSecond Timothy 1 verse 1, 2, 5, 6.    **\n1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, \n2 To Timothy, my dearly beloved son  Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. \n5 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also. \n6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.    **\nIf you can pray, the Lord will surprise you. Learn from Mary  she was not a careless woman, she was a zealous, godly, holy, passionate and compassionate woman. She was a woman that identified with God concerning the sins of this life; she cried along with God. When the Lord was crying on the cross, she was also crying by the side of the cross for the salvation of the world. And this woman produced children that worked for the salvation of the world. Let your children contribute to the salvation of humanity!\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "WHAT DENOMINATIONS HAVE DONE WRONGLY   **\nAt the early times when denomination began in Christianity   **\n1. They saved the Church from Catholicism and its autocracy\n2. They saved the Church from Doctrinal heresies perpetrated by false teachers \nFirst Timothy 6 verse 5   **\nPerverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness; from such withdraw thyself.   **\n3. They united true believers to form assembly of true worshipers\n Hebrews 10 verse 5   **\nNot forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.   **\n4.They preserved the truth of the scripture in the earlier time. \nREASONS WHY DENOMINATIONS HAVE FAILED GOD.    **\nBut now, denominations have failed God due to the reasons stated below  \n1. Denominations make the Church open to whosoever can start one, whether called by God or not, whether born again or not.   **\nJeremiah. 23 verse 32    **\nBehold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them  therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.   **\n 2. Denominations do not have checks and balances because every denomination is practically independent of the other. Some are even independent of God and the Holy Scriptures.   **\n Isaiah 65 verse 5    **\n Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.    **\n3. Human beings are at the mercy of fellow men who are church founders and denominational leaders. Each leader does what he wants to his members to accomplish his will. \nJeremiah 2 verse 8    **\n8 The priests said not, Where is the Lord? and they that handle the law knew me not; the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.   **\n4. The Bible is no more considered the central book for doctrine and practice of righteousness    **\nMark 7 verse 7 to 9   **\n7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. 8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups, and many other such like things ye do.\n9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.    **\n5. Everyone is free to interpret the Bible and direct its practice. That puts the scripture in the hands of unlearned and corrupt teachers.   **\nMatthew 15 verse 14   **\n Let them alone, they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.    **\n6. Denominations breed arguments because no denomination leader wants to submit to the scriptural authority of another    **\nThird  John 9 to 10  **\n 9 I wrote unto the church, but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. \n10 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words; and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.    **\n7. Denominations promote worldly approach in pastoring and preservation of members because, growth, popularity and wealth is their goal, not heaven.   **\nPhilippians 3 verse 18 to 20   **\n 18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ  \n19 Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.) 20 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ     **\n8. Many Denominations breed competition in achievements because the denominational leaders seek to please men to attract them to their church; they are not pleasing God by keeping His truth and righteousness. \n9. They exclude God in their affairs because Truth, Righteousness and Holiness cannot be maintained where human advantage is the drive for ministry. \n10. Righteousness and Holiness of life have been replaced by drive for money, membership, worship structure and worldly excellence in music and entertainment.  **\n First Timothy 6 verse 6, 9 to 11   **\n 6 But godliness with contentment is great gain. 9 But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition. 10 For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows. \n11 But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.    **\n11. Denominations open the door for Satan to come and supply demonic powers, methods and resources for success; Satan is promptly ready to take over the Church from ungodly leaders by introducing the to witchcraft and use of charms.   **\n Second Corinthians  11 verse 13 to 15     **\n13 For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. 15 Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.   **\n 12. They destroy unity and oneness in doctrine, evangelism and Scriptural holy living, because the churches are not all under one Lord Jesus and the control of the Holy Spirit. \n13. Church members believe in, and submit to their denominational Leaders, Overseers, Bishops and Superintendents more than to God. There is, in many cases, no difference between submission to their leader and worship of their leader, since they can break the scripture to please their church leaders.   **\n NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF DENOMINATIONALISM ON THE CHURCH    **\n1. In a great measure, the church is no more under the control of God \n2. The church is no longer united as one because every leader is seeking his own glory.    **\nJohn 5 verse 41,42,44    **\n41 I receive not honour from men. 42 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. 44 How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?   ** \n3. The church is left in the hands of many leaders that God did not call into ministry \nHebrews  5 verse 4   **\n And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.\n 4. The church is being fed with chaff and teachings that kill true Christian faith  ** \nSecond Timothy 2 verse 17 to 18   **\n17 And their word will eat as doth a canker; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 18 Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.   **\n5. The spread of the denominational church is by the wisdom and power of men, not by the Holy Spirit. Hence, various forms of programs and substances are being introduced to remove God's presence  holy water, apron , handkerchief, sand, oil etc. These are used contrary to God’s word to pollute the worshipers. \n6. The faith of the worshipers is on the wisdom and power of their Pastor, Leader, Bishop, Overseer, Superintendent, and not on the Lord Jesus Christ who died for them.    **\n First Timothy 2 verse 4 to 5   **\n4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. 5 For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;    **\n7. The churches literally reject, fight and compete with each other for membership, monetary and material gains.    **\nGalatians. 5 verse 15 But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.    **\n8. The central leadership (CAN, PFN), raised over the church by the government can only interfere with the church socially, politically, relationally and not doctrinally, spiritually or in Holiness.   **\nFirst Corinthians  2 verse 14   **\nBut the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God,  for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.    **\n9. The message and demands of the scripture are optional and by choice, not compulsory because denominational rules, regulations and the decrees of the leaders are considered superior to the scripture. \n10. The word of the Lord suffers dilution, resistance and attacks in the churches, beginning from the leadership.    **\nThird John 9 to 10    **\n9 I wrote unto the church; but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. \n10 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words; and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.    **\n11. Both the written and prophetic word of God have no binding power on the church ministers and members because they do not believe in them. \n12. The return of Jesus Christ in the rapture is not known, or is argued against or is not prepared for by many assemblies. \n13. Many churches are no more the pillars and ground of truth in the world but have become the habitation of devils.   **\n Revelation 18 verse 2,4,5    **\n2 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. \n4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. \n5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.  **\n14. Because of backsliding and apostasy, churches are following the broad way to hell and everlasting damnation \n15. Very few churches and ministers are following the narrow way of righteousness, holiness and eternal life.    **\nMatthew 7 verse 13,14    **\n13 Enter ye in at the strait gate  for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat  14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.    **\n CHRIST'S REMEDY FOR HIS END TIME CHURCH    **\nThe Lord in His mercy has decided  1. To remove the church from the hands of Philosophers and Deceptive Leaders who are unfit to shepherd His people to eternal life.    **\nEzekiel 34 verse 1 to 3, 9 to 11    **\n1 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 2 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? \n3 Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed  but ye feed not the flock. 9 Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD;\n 10 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them. 11 For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out.  **\n2. To take over His church to lead them directly by Himself.   **\nJohn 10 verse 14 to 16, 27, 28   **\n14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine. 15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father  and I lay down my life for the sheep. \n16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold, them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.\n 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me  28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.   **\n 3. To restore the church to the right place of Authority and Power on earth.\n Matthew 16 verse 18    **\nAnd I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.   **\n4. The Lord has decided to recover the Place, Efficacy, Power and Authority of His eternal word.    **\nFirst Thessalonians 2 verse 13    **\nFor this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.  **\n5. To promote the place of the written, spoken and prophetic word of God in the church.    **\n Isaiah 55 verse 10, 11   **\n 10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater   \n11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.   ** \n6. To Release the convicting Power of His undiluted word on sinners for their true faith in Christ and salvation from sin.    **\nActs 2 verse 37 to 39    **\n37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? \n38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. \n39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.    **\n7. To adorn the Doctrines of the Holy Scripture in His church.  **\nTitus 2 verse 7 to 10    **\n7 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works; in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity, \n8 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you. \n9 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again; 10 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.   **\n8. To promote Truth, Righteousness and Holiness by the working of His Holy Spirit among believers.   **\n First Timothy 3 verse 15    **\nBut if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.    **\n9. To reveal and destroy the works and activities of the flesh in the Church.   **\nFirst John 3 verse 8 For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. \nFirst Peter 4 verse 17, 18   **\n17 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God; and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? \n18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?    **\n10. To turn the church away from the grip of Denominations to His authority and to put the church in the hand of non-denominational leadership that respects and honours His word and name.    **\nActs 20 verse 28 to 30    **\n28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. \n29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. 30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.    **\nTitus 1 verse 1 to 3    **\n1 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness; 2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began; 3 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour.   **\n11. To make appearances to men, women and children, believers and unbelievers, to authenticate scriptural truths.\n12. To take people to hell and heaven to confirm the message of the scriptures for all to know and believe the truth that takes to heaven.    **\nIsaiah 66 verse 24    **\n And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.   **\n Ezekiel 40 verse 4    **\nAnd the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither  declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.    **\n13. Jesus has decided to expose ungodly dressing and adornment that damns souls of men and women in hell fire.   **\n Revelation 22 verse 16    **\nI Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches (Hell and Heaven experiences). I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.    **\n14. To raise up Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide Non-Denominational to serve as the light of the churches on earth on Truth, Righteousness and Holiness. \n15. To give Holiness Revival Movement and her God appointed leader in this endtime the mandate for church unity in doctrine and Holy living in preparation for His soon return in the rapture.    **\nActs 22 verse 14,15    **\n14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know His will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the voice of His mouth. 15 For thou shalt be His witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.  ** \n16. The Lord Jesus has decided to convict men, women and children by divine signs to believe, receive, promote and publish the messages and scriptural teachings of Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide among churches and men in the world as standard required for Escaping Hell Fire and entry into heaven in the rapture or after death on earth.    **\nColossians. 1 verse 28, 29    **\n 28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus  29 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to His working, which worketh in me mightily.  ** \n17. To release the spirit of Christian unity and oneness to Christ's churches in the world as the last act of mercy for human salvation and eternal life.   **\nEphesians. 4 verse 3 to 6    **\n3 Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. 4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; 5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism, 6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS ON THE USE Of JEWELRY   **\n First Timothy 2 verse  9 to 10   **\n9 In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; \n10 But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.  **\nThe word 'Gold' also means jewelry. It is a compound word that stands for all items of ornamentation that men, and especially women use to promote bodily beauty for human commendation. Gold or jewelry are itemized in this scripture.   **\nNumbers 31 verse 50 to 51   **\n50 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets (necklace), to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.\n 51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels. Here, they were collected from the heathen by the children of Israel who used them after a successful divinely instructed war against them. In the above passage, Jewelry includes; earrings, rings (wedding rings).    **\nNumbers 31 verse 1    **\n1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites, afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.   **\nThey were brought as an offering of thanksgiving by the warriors to God for protecting all of them in the completed war. These items were to be fashioned to utensils in the tabernacle God commanded to be built for Him among the children of Israel. While sinful men and women seek the beauty of jewelry, God gives the beauty of godly character.   ** \nIsaiah 61 verse 10   **\n I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of  righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.    **\nExodus 35 verse 4 to 5, 22    **\n 4 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the Lord commanded, saying, \n5 Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord; whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the Lord; gold, and silver, and brass, \n22 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold; and every man that offered offered an offering of gold unto the Lord.    **\nWe may need to remember that these items were collected from the Egyptians when the children of Israel were leaving Egypt by divine favour, and as riches and wealth to Israel as God promised Abraham.   **\n Exodus 3 verse 21 to 22    **\n21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty; \n22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment; and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.  ** \n Genesis 15 verse 13 to 14    **\n13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; \n14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with great substance.    **\nThe emphasis here is on all wrought jewels which means gold or jewelry fashioned by man for bodily use.    **\nNumbers 31 verse 51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.   **\nThe Lord stopped Israel from putting them on for ornamentation or beauty of the physical body.\n Exodus 33 verse 4 to 6   **\n4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned, and no man did put on him his ornaments. \n5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people, I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee; therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. \n6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.    **\nHowever, Gold as a substance can be put into use by man in any other area it is required. Ornaments promote sensual gratification of bodily beauty, pride and highmindedness. They influence women to think superior of themselves for acquired beauty, hence cause them to be insubordinate to their husbands. They promote competitive spirit among women. The poor among them resort to earrings and other items of jewelry made of brass, clay, wood etc. Some use beads. The New Testament reveals that God desires the beauty or ornamentation of the heart which is of great value to Him. Since the general ban on the use of ornament in\n Exodus 33 verse 4 to 6, the holy women who served the Lord from that time to the New Testament time never use ornaments in their adornment.   **\nFirst  peter 3 verse 4 to 5    **\n4 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price. \n5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands  This scripture above agrees with\nProverbs 31 verse 30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain;  but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.   **\nBeauty is vain but it is the woman with the fear of the Lord in her heart that is to be praised. Drive for bodily beauty by use of ornaments is vanity and is condemned by God's word.   **\n First John 2 verse 15 to 17   **\n 15 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. \n16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. \n17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God abidethfor ever.    **\nThose who use them are not holy women, although they may be born again. Not all that are born again are holy children of God. The following scripture show that you can be born again but may not be holy. All children of God are commanded to cleanse themselves from all filthiness of the body and spirit in order to be holy.   **\n Romans 12 verse 1 to 2    **\n1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. \n2 And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.   **\n Second Corinthians 7 verse 1     **\nHaving therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.   **\nFirst Peter 1 verse 14 to 16   **\n14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance; 15 But as He which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; 16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.  ** \nHoliness of heart and life is essential for anyone that desires to spend eternity with God. \nHebrews 12 verse 14   **\n 14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord  \nYou cannot make it to heaven with jewelry and make-up in your body. These things are defilements and abominable before God.   **\nRevelation 21 verse 27   **\n27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie, but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.    **\nSinners are called to repentance and salvation from sin through believing in Christ Jesus.   **\n Acts 16 verse 30 to 31; 20 to 21    **\nAnd brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? 31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. \nActs 20 verse 21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.   **\n Believers are called to consecration (self-cleansing) and faith in Christ Jesus for sanctification of heart and holiness of life.    **\nMatthew 5 verse 6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.   ** \nEphesians 5 verse 25 to 27    **\n25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave Himself for it; 26 That He might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, \n27 That He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.   **\nGod's word Forbids the following    **\nJerry curling, perming, hair attachment, dyeing of hair, tinting of hair, relaxing of hair, weave-on, stylish hairdo, worldly hair cut by men, use of wool to enlarge the braid, use of rubber thread for shiny hairdo, attaching normal thread to elongate the hair, artificial eyelash, eye shadow, eyebrows, use of mascara to darken and thicken the eyelashes, use of eye pencil, use of powder for facial beauty, body bleaching, use of cortex and false nails, use of lipsticks, use of trousers by women, use of short skirts and gowns, use of body hug, tight fitting and low neck dresses, use of armless dresses to reveal shoulders and armpits, use of high hill shoes, use of earrings, rings, bracelets, necklace, chains, nose ring, use of beads, long nails, painted nails, artificial nails, use of pencil trousers by men, use of crazy dresses, worldly haircut by men and so on and so forth.    **\n INSTANCES FOR REFERENCE    **\n1. The knowledge of the filthiness of jewelry in bodily adornment and its attachment to idolatry was not made known to Abraham and Isaac but was revealed to Jacob and he cleansed his people from them.    **\nGenesis 35 verse 2 to 4    **\n2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments  \n3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. \n4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid (Buried) them under the oak which was by Shechem.    **\n 2. The biblical story that Jesus gave stating that the father put a ring on the sons hand when he returned home was a secular story and the practice of secular men in the days of Jesus and Jesus was not here encouraging the use of jewelry by the story, but was revealing the merciful heart of God towards repentant sinners.   **\n3. The portrait of Mary the mother of Jesus has been maintained for centuries without jewelry because that was the dressing of holy women in Bible days.  **\n4. Jewelries are associated with idols and often carry demonic powers. In addition to false beauty, they are attires of an harlot. They are part of the adornment of prostitutes in Bible days.    **\nProverbs 7 verse 10 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.    **\nHosea 2 verse 13    **\n13 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the Lord.   **\nFor full understanding on this doctrine, order for my book  Divine Revelation And Scriptural Exposition On Believers' Holiness In Clothing And Adornment.\n",

      "body": "UN APPEL DIVIN AUX FEMMES SAINTES POUR L'EXPLOIT DE L'ÉVANGILE DE LA FIN DES TEMPS. **\n\nPRÉSENTATION **\nNous attestons tous de la situation actuelle des églises de Dieu partout dans le monde. Il n'y a pas de moment où nous avons besoin de plus d'ouvriers dans le domaine de l'évangélisation et du service de l'évangile que maintenant. Mais en observant les caractéristiques des hommes dans les Églises du Christ, nous remarquons à notre grande consternation que les hommes sont endormis dans le péché ; les hommes ont peur d'affronter le rugissement de Satan ; c'est pourquoi les hommes sont absents des églises de Dieu. C'est vrai parce qu'un regard sur les activités hebdomadaires de l'église et le culte vous montrera que les hommes sont rares et les femmes plus nombreuses. Les quelques hommes disponibles ne sont ni zélés ni dynamiques.  **\nCe sont les jours de Deborah; le Seigneur élève des femmes et déverse son Esprit sur elles pour le ministère de la fin des temps et les exploits de l'évangile. Que les hommes en soient jaloux et se repentent de leur tiédeur et de leur léthargie. Ce livre est écrit pour donner aux femmes l'inspiration et la motivation guidées par l'Esprit pour le ministère de l'Évangile. Le Seigneur qui appelle ses filles au ministère chrétien à tous égards sera avec elles et les rendra fructueuses dans le domaine de son service. Attendez-vous à un grand réveil de la part des femmes chrétiennes de notre temps. Le Seigneur est en route.  **\nMatthieu 28 verset 18 à 20    **\n\t« Et Jésus, s'approchant, leur parla, disant   Tout pouvoir m'a été donné dans le ciel et sur la terre.\n\tAllez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit  \n\tEnseignez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai commandé   et voici, je suis avec vous toujours, même jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amen. ”  **\n\nCHAPITRE UN   **\nPriscilla était une fille de Dieu et la femme d'Aquila. Tous deux étaient de grands ministres de l'évangile de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. Ils ont pris de l'importance sous le ministère de l'apôtre Paul.\n\n1.1 La connaissance de Priscilla avec Paul      **\n\nActes 18 verset 1 à 3    **\n\n«Après ces choses, Paul quitta Athènes et vint à Corinthe;\n\nEt trouva un certain Juif nommé Aquila, né à Pontus, récemment venu d'Italie, avec sa femme Priscilla; (parce que Claude avait ordonné à tous les Juifs de quitter Rome) et vint à eux.\n\nEt parce qu'il était du même métier, il demeurait avec eux et forgeait, car par leur profession ils étaient faiseurs de tentes.  ** \n\nL'apôtre Paul fit la connaissance d'Aquilas et de Priscille à Corinthe lorsqu'il y vint pour l'évangélisation. Il a été attiré par eux et est resté avec eux parce qu'ils exerçaient le même métier de fabricant de tentes, ils ont donc passé un bon long séjour ensemble. C'était un super\nprivilège à la maison d'Aquila. Paul l'apôtre était un noble de sagesse, plein de grâce, de perspicacité et de passion pour Dieu. Il avait un grand appel et s'est vendu pour l'évangile de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. Vivre dans la même maison et dans la même enceinte avec une telle personne était un rare privilège dont Priscilla avait pris connaissance et l'avait saisi à deux mains.  * *\n\nDans un récit similaire, la Sunamite a perçu qu'Elisée n'était pas un homme ordinaire, mais un grand et saint prophète de Dieu qui méritait un honneur particulier . Elle dit à son mari   **\n\n\"Je vois que c'est un saint homme de Dieu\".\n\nElisée passait régulièrement devant leur maison. La Sunamite et son mari ont accepté de fournir un logement à Élisée dans leur maison chaque fois qu'il viendrait. La présence d'Elisée dans cette maison a bouleversé la situation de la femme qui a donné naissance à un enfant après de nombreuses années de stérilité . Dans le cas de Priscilla, elle n'était pas stérile mais affamée de Dieu. Sa faim et sa soif de Dieu ont été satisfaites alors qu'elle profitait pleinement de son interaction amicale avec l'apôtre Paul.  **\n\nProverbes 13 verset 20    **\n\n\"Celui qui marche avec les sages sera sage, mais le compagnon des insensés sera détruit.\"  **\n\n1.2 Priscilla était une étudiante fidèle sous\n\nLe mentorat de Paul    **\n \nPhilippiens 4 verset 9    **\n\n\"Ce que vous avez appris, reçu, entendu et vu en moi, faites-le, et le Dieu de paix sera avec vous.\"  *\n\nPour être efficace et fructueux dans la vie et le ministère chrétiens, vous devez apprendre de ceux que le Seigneur a avancés, qui ont prouvé le témoignage de la vie et du ministère chrétiens saints.  **\n\nHébreux 13 verset 7    **\n\nSouvenez-vous de ceux qui ont le pouvoir sur vous, qui vous ont annoncé la parole de Dieu   dont la foi suit, considérant la fin de leur conversation.  **\n\n\nPhilippiens 3 verset 17    **\n\nFrères, soyez mes disciples ensemble, et notez ceux qui marchent de manière à ce que vous nous ayez pour exemple.  **\n\nLes gens devraient profiter de la vérité qui sort de ces vrais ministres de l'évangile pour être bénis. Il sera misérable pour quelqu'un d'être marié à un vrai ministre de Dieu et pourtant de manquer le privilège d'entrer au ciel.  **\n\nGenèse 19 verset 26    **\n\nMais sa femme se retourna derrière lui, et elle devint une statue de sel.  **\n\n\nPriscilla reste un bon exemple. Elle s'est laissée guider par l'apôtre Paul lorsque Paul résidait chez elle à Corinthe. Priscilla a profité de cette occasion avec Aquila pour écouter Paul et a fait tout ce qu'il lui a demandé de faire. La Sainte Écriture montre comment Priscille a sacrifié sa maison pour l'évangile de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ afin de tendre la main aux autres. Il y a une récompense bénie quand vous obéissez et vous humiliez sous des ministres vrais et authentiques de l'évangile.     **\n \nJacques 1 verset 22 à 25    **\n\n«Mais soyez des exécutants de la parole, et non seulement des auditeurs, en vous trompant vous-mêmes.\n\nCar si quelqu'un écoute la parole et ne l'exécute pas, il est semblable à un homme qui voit son visage naturel dans un miroir.\nPour lui se voit , et s'en va , et aussitôt oublie quelle sorte d'homme il était.\n\nMais quiconque examine la loi parfaite de la liberté et y demeure, n'étant pas un auditeur oublieux, mais un acteur de l'œuvre, cet homme sera béni dans son action.  **\n\nPriscille n'était pas une hypocrite comme les pharisiens. Les pharisiens ont construit les tombes des prophètes et les ont peintes en blanc pour honorer Dieu, mais ont pratiqué la tromperie intérieurement. Ils ont affirmé que si c'était de leur temps, ils n'auraient pas tué les prophètes de Dieu comme l'ont fait leurs pères. En d'autres termes, ils auraient traité les prophètes avec gentillesse et respect. De par leur caractère, les pharisiens sont généralement des gens bien-pensants, pleins d'hypocrisie. Jésus examina leurs cœurs et prononça le malheur sur eux. Les pharisiens ont tenté à plusieurs reprises de tuer Jésus, le plus grand de tous les prophètes. Aquila et Priscilla étaient différents. Ils étaient des exemples parfaits d'enfants de Dieu obéissants. Ils ont fait preuve d'humilité et soutenu l'œuvre de Dieu menée par l'apôtre Paul. Nous souhaitons que les femmes du Mouvement de la Sainteté se soumettent aux enseignements et au mentorat du Mouvement de Réveil de la Sainteté et à sa direction ; Ils devraient vivre une vie chrétienne authentique, sans hypocrisie.  **\n\n1.3 \tPaul a félicité Pricilla et Aquila    **\n\n1 Corinthiens 16 verset 19    **\n\n« Les églises d'Asie vous saluent. Aquilas et Priscille vous saluent beaucoup dans le Seigneur, avec l'église qui est dans leur maison.  **\n\nPaul, au nom de Priscille et d'Aquila, a adressé une salutation spéciale à l'église de Corinthe dans une expression du rôle amical que les deux ont joué en accueillant l'église dans leur maison pour le salut des âmes. Paul considérait Priscille et Aquilas comme des disciples dignes, justes et fidèles dans leur service à Dieu. Il les a estimés dignes en mentionnant leurs noms dans le Livre de l'éternité, la sainte Bible. Priscille et Aquila ont collaboré avec Paul dans la propagation de l'évangile de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. Suivez Dieu de tout cœur avec votre mari croyant. Ouvrez votre maison au culte de Dieu.  **\n\nRomains 16 verset 3 à 4    **\n\n« Saluez Priscille et Aquila mes aides en Jésus-Christ\nQui ont donné leur propre cou pour ma vie à qui non seulement je rends grâces, mais aussi toutes les églises des Gentils. ”  **\n\nPlusieurs références bibliques montrent que le nom de Priscille est apparu avant celui de son mari dans les lettres de Paul. Cela peut être dû au rôle de premier plan qu'elle a joué et à son engagement dans l'œuvre de l'Évangile. Dans l'un de ces cas, Priscille et Aquila ont accompagné Paul à Éphèse pour l'œuvre évangélique et cela a été dûment reconnu par Paul. Engagez-vous dans des activités de gain d'âme comme Priscilla l'a fait.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE DEUX   **\nPRISCILLA ÉTAIT HAUTEMENT ENGAGÉ POUR LA TRAVAIL D'ÉVANGILE    **\n\nActes 18 versets 18 à 19    **\n\n« Et Paul, après cela, resta là encore un bon moment, puis prit congé des frères, et s'embarqua de là pour la Syrie, et avec lui Priscille et Aquilas ; s'étant fait tondre la tête à Cenchrées car il avait fait un vœu.\n\nEt il vint à Éphèse, et les y laissa, mais il entra lui-même dans la synagogue et raisonna avec les Juifs.  **\n\nPaul a emmené avec lui Priscille et Aquilas lors de son voyage en Syrie et à Éphèse. Cela montrait le niveau de leur engagement.  **\n\n2.1. Priscilla a servi Dieu de tout son cœur Sans excuse  **\n\nBeaucoup de femmes donnent des plaintes et des excuses concernant l'œuvre de Dieu.\n\nLes actions de Priscilla dans l'œuvre évangélique avec Paul ont montré qu'elle n'était pas une femme négligente ou égoïste dans sa quête pour servir le Seigneur. Elle était désireuse de servir Dieu indépendamment des risques potentiels. Son cœur était totalement soumis au Seigneur. Dans le contexte actuel, certaines épouses de ministres de l'évangile peuvent choisir de passer à l'arrière en donnant des excuses indignes à leurs maris qui craignent Dieu plutôt que de coopérer avec eux dans l'œuvre de l'évangile. Ces femmes ne veulent pas prendre de risques et cherchent toujours la moindre excuse pour éviter de faire l'œuvre de Dieu. Un exemple concret est la femme d'un de mes coordinateurs qui m'a donné une excuse quand je lui ai demandé d'enseigner dans une classe d'étude biblique. Elle m'a envoyé un SMS disant qu'elle ne pouvait pas enseigner dans une foule à cause de sa timidité. Le Seigneur m'a dit que je devais insister et lui faire faire la tâche assignée. Elle a fini par enseigner dans cette classe d'étude biblique et elle a bien réussi. Cela nous dit qu'il y a des privilèges que Dieu apporte sur votre chemin et vous ne devez pas jouer avec la timidité ou la timidité. Ne vous excusez pas de l'œuvre précieuse de Dieu !  **\n\nJérémie 1 verset 4 à 10   **\n\n« Alors la parole de l'Éternel vint à moi, disant  \n\nAvant de te former dans le ventre , je te connaissais ; et avant que tu sois sorti du ventre de ma mère, je t'ai sanctifié, et je t'ai établi prophète des nations.\n\nAlors j'ai dit, Ah , Seigneur DIEU ! voici, je ne peux pas parler car je suis un enfant.\nMais l'Éternel me dit  Ne dis pas que je suis un enfant, car tu iras vers tous ceux que je t'enverrai, et tu diras tout ce que je te commanderai.\n\nN'aie pas peur de leurs faces, car je suis avec toi pour te délivrer, dit l'Éternel.\nAlors l'Éternel étendit sa main et toucha ma bouche. Et l'Éternel me dit  Voici, j'ai mis mes paroles dans ta bouche.\n\n\nVois, je t'ai établi aujourd'hui sur les nations et sur les royaumes, pour extirper, abattre, détruire, renverser, bâtir et planter ».  **\n\nLes épouses des dirigeants chrétiens devraient cesser de donner des excuses dans le travail du ministère. Priscilla n'a jamais donné d'excuses pour l'œuvre de l'évangile. Elle a toujours soutenu et fidèle l'œuvre évangélique avec Paul et son mari, Aquilas. La justice, la sainteté et la vérité sont entre vos mains. N'en privez pas les gens. Priscille et Aquilas ont fait usage du privilège qu'ils avaient avec Paul. L'Acte de l'Apôtre montre que Priscille a été la source d'inspiration pour l'engagement de son mari dans l'œuvre évangélique avec Paul. Le nom de Priscilla a reçu une priorité plus élevée sur le nom de son mari trois fois dans les Écritures sous le ministère de Paul. Les théologiens ont estimé que le nom de Pricilla était plus prononcé dans les Écritures que celui de son mari pour indiquer la grâce et l'engagement supérieurs en elle.  **\n\nDeuxième Timothée 4 verset 19    **\n\n\"Salut Prisca et Aquilas, et la maison d' Onésiphore .\"  **\n\n\n2.2.\tPriscilla était inébranlable avec Paul jusqu'à la fin\n\nPriscille et Aquila ont continué à travailler avec Paul, jusqu'au dernier jour de son ministère sur terre.    **\n\n\n2 Timothée 4 verset 6 à 8 ,16 à 19    **\n\n\"Car je suis maintenant prêt à être offert, et le moment de mon départ est proche.\n\nJ'ai combattu un bon combat, j'ai terminé ma course, j'ai gardé la foi  \n\nDésormais, il m'est réservé une couronne de justice, que le Seigneur, le juste juge, me donnera en ce jour-là.\net pas seulement à moi, mais aussi à tous ceux qui aiment son apparition.\n\nA ma première réponse, personne ne s'est tenu avec moi, mais tous les hommes m'ont abandonné   je prie Dieu que cela ne leur soit pas reproché.\n\nNéanmoins, le Seigneur s'est tenu avec moi et m'a fortifié; afin que par moi la prédication soit pleinement connue, et que tous les Gentils l'entendent, et je fus délivré de la gueule du lion.\n\nEt le Seigneur me délivrera de toute mauvaise œuvre, et me conservera dans son royaume céleste   à qui soit la gloire pour les siècles des siècles. Amen.\n\nSaluez Prisca et Aquilas, et la maison d' Onésiphore .  **\n\nPaul savait que son service dans l'œuvre de l'évangile touchait à sa fin et il était prêt à rencontrer Jésus-Christ au ciel. La référence scripturaire ci-dessus montre également la fermeté de Priscille avec son mari pour soutenir l'œuvre évangélique avec Paul jusqu'à la fin. Les femmes saintes doivent rester fermes dans l'œuvre de l'évangile avec leurs maris jusqu'à la fin. En d'autres termes, les femmes devraient être les inspiratrices de leurs maris dans l'œuvre évangélique comme l'a fait Priscille. Il ne devrait y avoir aucun retour en arrière jusqu'à la mort ou l'enlèvement. Dieu a mis la grâce dans votre vie pour soutenir votre mari dans le travail du ministère. Soyez fidèle à Dieu et à votre mari.    **\n\nPremier Pierre 3 versets 5 à 6    **\n\n« Car de cette manière dans l'ancien temps aussi les saintes femmes, qui se confiaient en Dieu, se paraient elles-mêmes, étant soumises à leurs propres maris.\n\nDe même que Sara obéit à Abraham, l'appelant seigneur   dont vous êtes les filles, pourvu que vous agissiez bien et que vous ne craigniez aucun étonnement.  **\n\n\nOn a raconté l'histoire d'une femme fidèle dont le mari a été arrêté pour avoir prêché l'évangile du Christ dans un pays communiste. La menace du gouvernement communiste ne l'a pas empêchée de soutenir son mari jusqu'au bout. Le mari a été emmené en prison et il a été jugé pour renier Jésus ou faire face à une condamnation à mort. Pendant ce temps, la femme a demandé à voir son mari en prison. La femme s'est tenue comme une inspiratrice pour son mari et s'est assurée qu'il ne renie pas Jésus pour quelque raison que ce soit.  **\n\nElle était prête à être veuve pour l'amour du Christ. Elle a inspiré son mari à ne pas renier Jésus en prison, mais à résister au diable jusqu'au bout. Comme le Seigneur l'aurait voulu, la femme a été autorisée à voir son mari dans la prison par le gouvernement communiste. Elle a été autorisée à visiter la prison dans l'espoir de persuader son mari de renier Jésus. Lorsqu'elle est entrée en prison, elle a rencontré son mari et l'a encouragé à ne pas renier Jésus malgré la peine de mort qui pesait sur son cou. Lorsque les responsables gouvernementaux ont remarqué qu'elle encourageait plutôt son mari à rester ferme dans sa conviction pour le Christ, ils ont menacé de l'exécuter avec son mari. Elle leur a dit que c'était une bonne nouvelle car cela lui donnerait le rare privilège de mourir le même jour avec son mari et d'être pour toujours avec leur bienheureux Seigneur et Sauveur Jésus-Christ au ciel. Toutes les persuasions pour les convaincre de renier Jésus ont échoué.  **\n\nPuisse un tel esprit de foi inébranlable et inébranlable qui vous incitera à défendre Jésus au risque de votre vie venir sur vous. C'est ainsi que Priscille et Aquila sont restés inébranlables jusqu'à la fin. Notez que la Bible ne dit rien sur leurs enfants. Nous ne savons pas s'ils avaient des enfants ou non. Ce qui était le plus important d'entre eux et digne d'une mention éternelle était leur vie et leur ministère chrétiens fidèles.  **\n\nRomains 8 verset 35 à 39   **\n\n« Qui nous séparera de l'amour de Christ ? Tribulation, ou détresse, ou persécution, ou famine, ou nudité, ou péril, ou épée ?\n\nComme il est écrit, à cause de toi nous sommes tués toute la journée ; nous sommes comptés comme des moutons de boucherie.\n\nBien plus, en toutes ces choses, nous sommes plus que vainqueurs par celui qui nous a aimés.\n\nCar je suis persuadé que ni la mort, ni la vie, ni les anges, ni les dominations, ni les puissances, ni les choses présentes ni les choses à venir,\n\n\nNi la hauteur, ni la profondeur, ni aucune autre créature ne pourra nous séparer de l'amour de Dieu manifesté en Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur.  **\n\n2.3. Priscilla a façonné sa vie après Paul,\n\nSon mentor    **\n\nPriscille connaissait la discipline du ministère de Paul et comprenait également la vérité de l'évangile. Elle a suivi le modèle de Paul dans le ministère et a enduré les souffrances attachées à l'évangile.  **\n\nPhilippiens 4 verset 9    **\n\n\"Ces choses que vous avez apprises, reçues, entendues et vues en moi, faites-les, et le Dieu de paix sera avec vous.\"  **\n\nPriscilla était prédicatrice et enseignante de la saine doctrine. Elle a prêché le plein évangile   le salut du péché, la sanctification du cœur, le baptême du Saint-Esprit, attesté par le parler en langues. Elle a enseigné la restitution   corriger les mauvaises actions passées ; elle a enseigné le mariage chrétien standard, un homme, une femme jusqu'à la mort de l'une ou l'autre des parties, le paiement de la dîme, la justice, la sainteté et la vérité dans les affaires et dans les relations humaines. En tant que gagnante d'âmes passionnée, elle a persuadé les croyants de gagner des âmes pour Christ et d'être prêts pour le retour de Christ. Étant elle-même un exemple, elle a enseigné la soumission des femmes à leurs propres maris en tout et les maris aiment leurs femmes, les soins des parents pour les enfants et l'obéissance des enfants à leurs parents. Elle a appris ces vérités et d'autres évangiles de Paul, son mentor.  **\n\n\n\nTite 2 verset 1   **\n\n« Mais dis ce qui convient à la saine doctrine   »\n\n\nPremier Timothée 4 versets 15 et 16   **\n\n«Méditez sur ces choses; donne-toi entièrement à eux; que ton profit puisse apparaître à tous.\n\nPrends garde à toi-même et à la doctrine ; continue en eux, car en faisant cela, tu te sauveras et tu sauveras ceux qui t'écoutent.  **\n\nLes femmes qui ont appris et apprennent la doctrine et la discipline de la vérité, de la justice et de la sainteté devraient la répandre dans leur société et dans le monde\n\nBeaucoup de gens à cette époque étaient de nouveaux convertis en Christ. Ils n'ont jamais connu la vérité de l'évangile. Mais Priscille était une vraie disciple de Paul dans la vie et la doctrine. Elle a pratiqué la vie constante de justice et de sainteté en tant que chrétienne et prédicatrice de la sainteté. Elle s'habillait saintement. Elle n'utilisait pas de bijoux pour s'adorer ni ne se livrait à une coiffure fantaisiste.  **\n\n1 Thessaloniciens 2 verset 10   **\n\n« Vous êtes témoins, et Dieu aussi, de la sainteté, de la justice et de l'irréprochabilité que nous nous sommes comportés parmi vous qui croyez   »   **\n\n2 Timothée 1 verset 13 à 15    **\n \n« Retiens la forme des paroles saines que tu as entendues de moi, dans la foi et l'amour qui est en Jésus-Christ.\n\nCette bonne chose qui t'a été confiée, garde-la par le Saint-Esprit qui habite en nous.\n\nsais ceci , que tous ceux qui sont en Asie se détournent de moi ; dont Phygellus et Hermogenes.\n\nPaul était un exemple pratique d'un vrai ministre de Dieu. Priscilla a imité l'exemple de Paul en tendant la main aux âmes qui périssent. Elle était zélée pour Jésus et a appris beaucoup de révélations de vérité de Paul.  **\n\nDeuxième Timothée 2 verset 2    **\n\n\"Et les choses que tu as entendues de moi parmi de nombreux témoins, les mêmes te confient à des hommes fidèles, qui pourront aussi enseigner aux autres.\"  **\n\nLes doctrines et les pratiques que vous avez apprises des vrais ministres chrétiens devraient être transmises aux autres.  **\n \nCHAPITRE TROIS   **\n\nPRISCILLA EST DEVENUE UNE MENTOR ELLE-MÊME   **\n\n3.1 Priscilla a encadré Apollos   **\n\nPriscille et Aquila ont rencontré Apollos qui n'avait pas une connaissance complète du message de l'Évangile. Apollos n'était au courant que du baptême de Jean. Ils ont tendu la main pour le perfectionner en Christ.  **\n\nActes 18 versets 24 à 28    **\n\n« Et un Juif nommé Apollos, né à Alexandrie, homme éloquent et puissant dans les Écritures, vint à Éphèse.\n\nCet homme était instruit dans la voie du Seigneur ; et étant fervent dans l'esprit, il parlait et enseignait avec diligence les choses du Seigneur, ne connaissant que le baptême de Jean.\n\nEt il se mit à parler hardiment dans la synagogue qu'Aquilas et Priscille ayant entendue, ils l'emmenèrent auprès d'eux, et lui exposèrent plus parfaitement la voie de Dieu.\n\nEt quand il fut disposé à passer en Achaïe, les frères écrivirent, exhortant les disciples à le recevoir   qui, quand il fut venu, les a beaucoup aidés qui avaient cru par grâce\nCar il a puissamment convaincu les Juifs, et cela publiquement , montrant par les Écritures que Jésus était le Christ.  **\n\nApollos parlait bien de Christ mais connaissait peu la vérité de l'évangile. C'était un homme zélé mais qui n'avait pas une connaissance adéquate du message de l'évangile. Priscilla et Aquila ont trouvé Apollos comme matériau potentiel pour l'œuvre évangélique. Ils l'ont pris à part et l'ont instruit pour lui faire comprendre clairement la vérité de l'évangile. Apollos était un homme humble. Il n'a pas résisté au mentorat d'une femme. Cela a fait d'Apollos un grand prédicateur de l'évangile de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.  **\n\nActes 19 verset 1 à 4   **\n\n« Et il arriva que, pendant qu'Apollos était à Corinthe, Paul, ayant traversé les côtes supérieures, vint à Éphèse et trouva certains disciples,\n\nIl leur dit   Avez -vous reçu le Saint-Esprit depuis que vous avez cru ? Et ils lui dirent  Nous n'avons même pas entendu dire s'il y a un Saint-Esprit.\n\nEt il leur dit   En quoi avez-vous donc été baptisés ? Et ils dirent   Au baptême de Jean.\n\nAlors Paul dit   Jean, en vérité, a baptisé du baptême de repentance, disant au peuple qu'il devait croire en celui qui devait venir après lui, c'est-à-dire en Jésus-Christ . ”  **\n\n\nLes écritures ci-dessus ont révélé les connaissances limitées d'Apollos sur le Christ avant de rencontrer Aquilas et Priscille. Il avait peu ou pas de connaissance du Christ en tant que Seigneur et Sauveur personnel de toute l'humanité. De plus, il avait peu ou pas de connaissances sur le baptême du Saint-Esprit. Il parlait et citait des Écritures au sujet de Christ, mais avait peu de connaissances pratiques sur lui. Cela signifie qu'Apollos ne connaissait pas Christ comme son Seigneur et Sauveur personnel . Priscilla et Aquila ont reconnu qu'Apollos pouvait prêcher mais avait encore une profonde ignorance en lui. De leur point de vue, ils savaient qu'une telle insuffisance pouvait amener Apollos à égarer les autres du véritable évangile de Christ. Une leçon clé à tirer de cela est que vous savez peut-être comment prêcher pour attirer l'attention des autres, mais vous avez toujours besoin d'un véritable mentorat pour être efficace dans l'œuvre de l'Évangile. Nous vous encourageons à vous procurer les messages, les livres et le matériel d'évangile de Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide pour parfaire votre connaissance de Jésus-Christ et de sa sainte parole et de ses voies   **\n\nLuc 1 verset 1 à 4    **\n\n\"Puisque plusieurs ont pris l'initiative d'énoncer dans l'ordre une déclaration des choses auxquelles on croit le plus sûrement parmi nous,\n\n\nComme ils nous les ont livrés,\n\nqui dès le début étaient des témoins oculaires et des ministres de la parole;\n\n\nIl m'a semblé bon aussi, ayant eu une connaissance parfaite de toutes choses dès le premier instant, de t'écrire dans l'ordre, très excellent Théophile,\n\n\nAfin que tu connaisses la certitude de ces choses, dans lesquelles tu as été instruit.  **\n\n\n3.2\tHumble soumission d'Apollos au mentorat de Priscilla   **\n\n\nJacques 4 verset 6   **\n\n« Mais il donne plus de grâce. C'est pourquoi il dit   Dieu résiste aux orgueilleux, mais il fait grâce aux humbles.\n\nPremier Pierre 5 verset 5 et 6   **\n\n« De même, vous les plus jeunes, soumettez-vous à l'aîné. Oui, soyez tous soumis les uns aux autres et revêtez-vous d'humilité, car Dieu résiste aux orgueilleux et fait grâce aux humbles.\n\nHumiliez-vous donc sous la puissante main de Dieu, afin qu'il vous élève en temps voulu   »  **\n\nIl faut de l'humilité pour céder à un véritable mentorat dans l'œuvre évangélique, comme l'a fait Apollos. L'un des signes de la faillite spirituelle aujourd'hui est le manque d'humilité chez de nombreux chrétiens, ce qui les fait rejeter le mentorat dans l'œuvre évangélique. Beaucoup ne sont pas disposés à apprendre des vrais ministres de l'évangile. La raison en est peut-être la différence d'âge, les différences confessionnelles, l'ancienneté ministérielle, l'ignorance doctrinale qui nie la soumission à une femme dans les choses de Dieu.  **\n\nOn a raconté l'histoire d'un roi qui était très dur. Il était si dur et pompeux que ses serviteurs avaient pratiquement du mal à le corriger sur quoi que ce soit. Un jour, il avait l'estomac qui coulait en allant à une réunion avec son domestique. Il devait utiliser les toilettes avant d'aller à la réunion. Cependant, il ne savait pas qu'après avoir visité les toilettes, une partie de ses insignes coulants avait des taches d'excréments dessus. Son serviteur remarqua le désordre dès qu'il sortit des toilettes, mais il eut peur d'en informer le fier roi. Le roi entra majestueusement dans la salle de réunion sans se douter qu'il était accompagné de ses excréments et de son regard offensant. Ce fut un grand embarras public lorsqu'il fut informé par le public des excréments sur sa robe.  **\n\nDe cette histoire, nous apprenons que la fierté et l'arrogance apportent la honte et la disgrâce. Par conséquent, soyez doux et humble et soyez prêt à recevoir la correction et la réprimande des autres pour votre sagesse, votre excellence et votre perfection.  **\n\nMatthieu 11 verset 28 à 30   **\n\n« Venez à moi, vous tous qui êtes fatigués et chargés, et je vous donnerai du repos.\n\nPrenez Mon joug sur vous et apprenez de Moi. car je suis doux et humble de cœur et vous trouverez du repos pour vos âmes.\n\nCar mon joug est aisé, et mon fardeau est léger.  **\n\nSi vous êtes fier, les gens vous laisseront avec vos erreurs au détriment de votre âme. Apollos était un homme humble, il a donc bénéficié à bien des égards du fruit de son humilité. Vous pouvez être un bon serviteur de Jésus, mais il peut encore y avoir une certaine ignorance dans votre vie. Vous prêchez peut-être très bien, mais vous avez encore des erreurs qui polluent votre message. Certains de ces prédicateurs ont juste besoin d'une seconde touche de Jésus pour être des prédicateurs efficaces de l'évangile. Apollos est devenu un prédicateur efficace après le mentorat de Priscilla et de son mari.  **\n\n3.3.\tL'âge n'est pas un facteur déterminant dans le mentorat   **\n\n\nGalates 1 verset 15 à 16    **\n\n\"Mais quand il a plu à Dieu, qui m'a séparé dès le sein de ma mère et m'a appelé par sa grâce,\n\nPour révéler son Fils en moi, afin que je puisse le prêcher parmi les païens ; immédiatement je n'ai pas conféré avec la chair et le sang »  **\n\nEphésiens 3 versets 1 à 4, versets 7 et 8    **\n\n« A cause de cela, moi Paul, le prisonnier de Jésus-Christ pour vous les Gentils,\n\nSi vous avez entendu parler de la dispensation de la grâce de Dieu qui m'est donnée pour vous;\n\nComment cela par révélation Il m'a fait connaître le mystère; (comme je l'ai écrit en peu de mots,\n\n\nPar quoi, quand vous lisez, vous pouvez comprendre ma connaissance du mystère du Christ)\n\n\nDont j'ai été fait ministre, selon le don de la grâce de Dieu qui m'a été donné par l'action efficace de sa puissance.\n\nA moi, qui suis moins que le moindre de tous les saints, cette grâce a été donnée de prêcher parmi les Gentils les richesses insondables de Christ.  **\n\nAquilas et Priscille ont été conduits par Dieu pour être encadrés par Paul, l'apôtre, un homme renommé pour la justice, la sainteté, la connaissance de Dieu et les révélations de Jésus-Christ. Paul était un homme de Dieu, appelé à enseigner l'évangile et doté des dons du Saint-Esprit.  **\n\nQuel privilège de servir le Seigneur sous un tel homme de Dieu ! L'apôtre Pierre a reconnu la sagesse de Paul et s'est humilié pour lire les écrits de l'apôtre Paul qu'il a appelés écritures.  **\n\nDeuxième Pierre 3 versets 15 à 16    **\n\n« Et comptez que la longanimité de notre Seigneur est le salut ; comme notre bien-aimé frère Paul vous l'a aussi écrit, selon la sagesse qui lui a été donnée;\n\nComme aussi dans toutes ses épîtres, parlant en elles de ces choses; dans lequel il y a des choses difficiles à comprendre, que ceux qui sont ignorants et instables tordent, comme ils le font aussi les autres écritures, à leur propre destruction.  **\n\n\nNous ne servons pas dans une caserne militaire où nous nous attendons à être promus en fonction de la période de service. Paul a dit qu'il était le moindre de tous les apôtres, mais le Seigneur l'a utilisé pour faire de grands exploits pour Lui. Il a écrit beaucoup de mystères et de vérités qui nécessitaient des prières pour pouvoir les comprendre. Ceux-ci montrent que la différence d'âge n'a pas d'importance aux yeux de Dieu. Dieu a donné à Paul les révélations de l'évangile de Christ. Paul a fait de grands exploits pour le Seigneur indépendamment du fait qu'il a connu le Christ après les autres apôtres.    **\n\n\n3.4 Vous aurez peut-être besoin d'une seconde touche grâce au mentorat   **\n\n\n2 Corinthiens 12 verset 7    **\n\n\"Et de peur que je ne sois exalté au-dessus de toute mesure par l'abondance des révélations, il m'a été donné une écharde dans la chair, le messager de Satan pour me frapper, de peur que je ne sois exalté au-dessus de toute mesure.\"  **\n\nJe vous exhorte à obéir aux enseignements du mouvement de réveil de la sainteté, plein de vérité, de puissance, de sagesse et de sainteté. C'est le ministère de Dieu pour cette fin des temps. Faites les missions qui vous sont confiées par ce ministère. Ne vous occupez pas des choses de ce monde au détriment de votre âme. Arrêtez vos excuses indignes et écoutez les messages inspirés de ce ministère. Les messages sont mis à votre disposition par le biais de DVD, de CD, de livres, de magazines, de tracts et d'autres supports. Ces messages font partie du mentorat que Dieu souhaite que vous receviez dans le Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide (HEROMOW). Ils sont également disponibles sur YouTube. Dieu les utilise pour vous préparer en tant que vase d' honneur . N'écoutez pas les ennemis inspirés par Satan du Mouvement de la Sainteté qui publient des mensonges et des rapports pervers contre ce Mouvement et ses dirigeants pour entraver le salut des âmes humaines.  **\n\nPriscilla a reçu une deuxième touche du Seigneur après avoir été encadrée par Paul. Il y a beaucoup de \"Priscillas\" qui ont besoin d'être formées et faites pour recevoir une seconde touche du Seigneur. De la même manière, il y a beaucoup de \"ministres d'Apollos\" qui sont dans de mauvais mariages, mènent des vies immorales et ignorent la vérité de l'évangile. De tels \"ministres d'Apollos\" opèrent dans de profondes erreurs et ont donc besoin d'un second contact du Seigneur. Examinez-vous si vous faites partie de cette catégorie de \"ministres Apollon\" et cédez au véritable mentorat en Christ. Identifiez-vous avec le mouvement de la sainteté pour une formation appropriée sur l'évangile dans la vérité, la justice et la sainteté pour les exploits de la fin des temps.  **\n\nColossiens 2 versets 6 à 7    **\n« Comme vous avez donc reçu Christ Jésus le Seigneur, marchez en lui ;\n\nEnracinés et édifiés en lui, et affermis dans la foi, comme on vous l'a enseigné, abondant en actions de grâces.  **\n\nLe véritable mentorat est possible grâce à la soumission aux vrais ministres de Dieu. C'est une bénédiction, si vous avez un mari juste qui est un ministre du vrai évangile. Soumettez-lui. Accompagnez-le pour changer le monde. Aidez les églises confessionnelles à connaître le véritable évangile de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. Priscille a servi le Seigneur jusqu'à la fin.  ** \n\nTravaillez avec moi, Pasteur Paul Rika, pour promouvoir le Seigneur Jésus-Christ et la vérité, la justice et la sainteté bibliques. Rejoignez votre mari à HOREMOW pour travailler avec moi et soyez la Priscilla de nos jours en cette fin des temps. Faites-vous des amis avec les faibles en Christ. Encadrez-les et aidez-les à sortir de l'ignorance. Allez leur dire que Jésus-Christ est le Seigneur. Améliorez le ministère des pasteurs, des évangélistes, des prophètes et des enseignants, comme Priscille l'a fait sur Apollos. Soyez significatif dans la vie et le ministère chrétien!  **\n\nCHAPITRE QUATRE   **\n\nDIEU PEUT UTILISER UNE FEMME POUR ENSEIGNER, PRÊCHER ET PROPHÉTISER    **\n\nIl y avait une femme en Israël qui apporta réveil à la nation, les a récupérés de rétrograde et les a délivrés de la main de leurs ennemis. Elle s'appelait Déborah.  **\n\nJuges 4 verset 1 à 5    **\n\n« Et les enfants d'Israël firent de nouveau ce qui est mal aux yeux de l'Éternel, quand Éhud était mort.\n\nEt l'Éternel les vendit entre les mains de Jabin , roi de Canaan, qui régnait à Hatsor; le chef de l'armée de qui était Sisera, qui habitait à Harosheth des Gentils.\n\nEt les enfants d'Israël crièrent à l'Éternel ; car il avait neuf cents chars de fer; et vingt ans il opprima puissamment les fils d'Israel.\n\nEt Deborah, une prophétesse, la femme de Lapidoth , elle a jugé Israël à ce moment-là.\n\nEt elle habita sous le palmier de Débora, entre Rama et Béthel, sur la montagne d'Ephraïm ; et les enfants d'Israël montèrent vers elle pour le jugement »  **\n\n4.1. Le péché donne le dessus à l'ennemi   **\n\nIl était très courant qu'Israël tombe dans le péché et l'idolâtrie devant le Seigneur et perde sa présence et sa relation. Cela s'est produit maintes et maintes fois. Chaque fois que cela se produisait, le Seigneur permettait à leurs ennemis de les punir ou de les opprimer et lorsqu'ils criaient au Seigneur, il leur envoyait un chef national appelé juge, pour les délivrer. A cette occasion, lorsqu'ils péchèrent à nouveau contre lui , il les vendit à Jabin , le roi de Canaan qui les opprima cruellement pendant vingt ans. La leçon à tirer de ce cercle vicieux d'oppression d'Israël est que le péché renforce les mains de l'ennemi contre la personne pécheresse.  **\n\nProverbes 26 verset 2    **\n\n\"Comme l'oiseau en errant, comme l'hirondelle en volant, ainsi la malédiction sans cause ne viendra pas.\"  **\n\n\nVérifiez-vous lorsque vous commencez à voir des choses difficiles se présenter à vous. Il se peut que vous ayez quitté le Seigneur et que le Seigneur ait permis à Satan de prendre le dessus et de vous opprimer. C'était comme ça avec les enfants d'Israël. Quand ils quittaient le Seigneur, le Seigneur leur permettait de danser\nentre les mains de leurs ennemis, jusqu'à ce qu'ils se repentent et crient à lui. Ensuite, Il leur enverrait un chef, quelqu'un qui les rachèterait de leur situation. Si tel est votre cas, vous savez pourquoi vous traversez la frustration, vous savez pourquoi la main du Seigneur pèse sur votre vie, alors vous devez vous repentir. Arrêtez ce péché, revenez au Seigneur et criez à Lui de vous donner Son salut.  **\n\nEsaïe 55 verset 6 à 7    **\n\n« Cherchez l'Éternel pendant qu'il se trouve, invoquez-le pendant qu'il est près ;\n\nQue le méchant abandonne sa voie, et l'homme injuste ses pensées; et qu'il retourne à l'Éternel, et il aura pitié de lui; et à notre Dieu, car il pardonnera abondamment ».  **\n\n4.2 \tDieu peut utiliser un homme ou une femme    **\n\nJabin , le roi de Canaan, opprima Israël pendant vingt ans. Quand ils ont crié au Seigneur, il leur a donné Débora pour les délivrer. Il paraissait déplacé que les enfants d'Israël soient conduits par une femme. Si vous regardez la façon dont l'écrivain l'a écrit, son expression était avec emphase. Il voulait que les gens sachent que le chef était bien une femme. Au verset 4, il est dit   « Et Deborah » ; c'est un mot féminin. « Une prophétesse », un autre mot féminin. Parlons toujours de Deborah, « la femme de Lapidoth » ; encore un mot féminin. « Elle a jugé Israël à ce moment-là » ; la quatrième description féminine. Le tout pour souligner le caractère féminin de la personne dont on parle. Savez-vous vraiment comment il est arrivé que les Israélites en soient arrivés au point qu'une femme, Deborah, soit devenue leur juge ? Dieu a voulu montrer sa souveraineté sur sa créature humaine ?. Il peut utiliser qui Il veut. Dieu a fait cela pour humilier l'homme dans son orgueil et son dédain envers la femme. Dieu dit, j'utilise qui je veux.  **\n\nRomains 9 verset 15    **\n« Car il dit à Moïse   J'aurai pitié de qui j'aurai pitié, et j'aurai compassion de qui j'aurai compassion.  **\n\n\nNe pensez-vous pas que Dieu suive des formules stéréotypées ? Vous pouvez me voir suivre des formules quelques fois, mais si vous suivez continuellement des formules, vous ne me trouverez peut-être pas là.  **\n\nJean 3 verset 8    **\n\n« Le vent souffle où il veut , et tu en entends le bruit, mais tu ne sais pas d'où il vient, ni où il va ; il en est de même pour tous ceux qui sont nés de l'Esprit.  **\n\n\nDieu a suscité Deborah à cette époque pour diriger la nation d'Israël en tant que prophétesse et juge. Une femme prenant la tête des hommes n'était pas hors de propos pour Dieu jusqu'à ce jour. Laissez les hommes prendre soin de leurs femmes dans l'appel divin au service. Dieu peut choisir votre femme pour lui rendre un service spécial. Que votre mari ne dise pas   « Pourquoi pas lui à la place ? En tant qu'Être souverain, Dieu n'a pas de conseiller ou d'instructeur. Prévoyez, ô église, le ministère des femmes; car Dieu peut choisir de les utiliser. Dieu peut choisir d'utiliser une femme dans n'importe quel aspect du travail de l'église selon sa sagesse. Que l'Église ne dise pas   « Ah ! Il n'est pas normal que la femme soit pasteur. Hors service? Eh bien, voulez-vous que Dieu suive votre ordre ou Sa parole ? Bien que Dieu établisse l'ordre, oui, mais Ses ordres sont connus de Lui. Il peut faire d'une femme le pasteur d'une église. Vous voulez dire que Deborah, la femme de Lapidoth , n'était pas pasteur d'Israël ? Beaucoup interprètent mal des parties des Écritures pour confondre leurs disciples. Vous devez comparer les écritures avec les écritures pour comprendre la vérité de Dieu   **\n\nJérémie 3 verset 15    **\n\n\"Et je vous donnerai des pasteurs selon mon coeur, qui vous nourriront de connaissance et d'intelligence.\"  **\n\nJuges 4 versets 4 et 5    **\n\n« Et Débora, prophétesse, femme de Lapidoth , elle jugea Israël à cette époque.\n\nEt elle habita sous le palmier de Débora, entre Rama et Béthel, sur la montagne d'Éphraïm, et les enfants d'Israël montèrent vers elle pour le jugement.  **\n\nC'est la souveraineté de Dieu. Au cas où vous diriez « Non ! je ne l'écouterai pas; Je n'écouterai pas une femme. La Bible dit,  **\n\nMatthieu 10 verset 40    **\n\n\"Celui qui vous reçoit me reçoit , et celui qui me reçoit reçoit celui qui m'a envoyé.\" Alors apprenez l'humilité. Ô homme, apprends-le !  **\n\n4.3.\tUne femme qui prophétise implique de parler aux hommes   **\n\n\n1 Corinthiens 11 versets 5 et 13    **\n\nMais toute femme qui prie ou prophétise la tête découverte déshonore sa tête; car c'est même tout un comme si elle était rasée.\n\nJugez en vous-mêmes   est-il convenable qu'une femme prie Dieu à découvert ?  **\n\nUne femme peut être choisie pour enseigner sur n'importe quel sujet. Certains pharisiens peuvent objecter ce dicton   « Ce ne sera jamais, c'est hors d'usage. En fait la Bible dit dans   **\n\nPremier Timothée 2 versets 11 à 12    **\n\n« Que la femme apprenne en silence avec toute sujétion. Mais je ne permets pas à une femme d'enseigner, ni d'usurper l'autorité sur l'homme, mais d'être en silence.  **\n\nVous citez même des écritures, juste pour exclure ces femmes du ministère. Le Seigneur vous demandera de revenir aux Écritures, puis de comparer les Écritures avec les Écritures. \"Ai-je Dieu dit un femme peut prophétiser dans l'église? Si oui, dire qu'une femme doit se taire signifie-t-il qu'elle ne doit pas prophétiser ? Ne suis-je pas celle qui a dit que lorsqu'elle prophétisait , elle devait se couvrir la tête ? Si oui, pourquoi prenez-vous Ma parole hors de son contexte, disant que le Seigneur a ordonné qu'elle se taise ? N'avez-vous pas comparé les Écritures avec les Écritures ? La prophétie est-elle une entreprise silencieuse ? Prophétisez-vous dans votre cœur ? Les gens vous entendront-ils ? Non! Encore une fois, ne vous ai-je pas dit que Philippe l'évangéliste avait quatre filles qui prophétisaient ? Au fait, qu'est-ce que la prophétie ? Quand Je dis que la femme doit prophétiser, n'est-ce pas selon Mon plan ?  **\n\nJoël 2 verset 28    **\n\n« Et il arrivera dans les derniers jours, dit Dieu, je répandrai mon Esprit sur toute chair ; et vos fils et vos filles prophétiseront --- -.  **\n\nQu'est-ce que je veux dire par là ? 1Corinthiens14 verset 3 dit, 'Mais celui qui prophétise parle …' Celui qui prophétise fait quoi? Parle ! Mais vous dites qu'elle devrait se taire. C'est pourquoi vous devez apprendre à interpréter les Écritures. Oui! Car la lettre tue , mais l'esprit vivifie, 2 Corinthiens. 3 verset 6. « Est-ce que Dieu lui dirait de prophétiser, puis lui interdirait complètement de parler ? Je ne ferai pas ca.\"  **\n \nEsaïe 66 verset 9    **\n\n« Dois-je enfanter, et ne pas faire enfanter ? dit l'Éternel; ferai-je enfanter et refermerai-je la matrice? dit ton Dieu.  **\n\n\nC'est Dieu qui vous pose une question. \"Celui qui les prophéties parlent aux hommes. 1 Corinthiens 14 verset 3. Alors , pourquoi dites-vous qu'elle ne devrait pas parler aux hommes ?  **\n\nDieu dit, celui qui a une parole de prophétie doit parler aux hommes. « Hommes » est ici un mot générique. Mariam était une prophétesse ; elle parlait aussi bien aux hommes qu'aux femmes. Débora, la prophétesse, s'adressait aussi bien aux hommes qu'aux femmes. De même, les filles de Dieu doivent aussi parler aux femmes et aux hommes. Et que dire aux hommes ?\n\nMais celui qui prophétise parle aux hommes pour l'édification, l'exhortation et la consolation.1Corinthiens. 14 verset 3. La Bible nous dit la parole de Dieu est la parole sûre de la prophétie.  **\n\nDeuxième Pierre 1 verset 19 à 21   **\n\n« Nous avons aussi une parole prophétique plus sûre ; à quoi vous faites bien de prendre garde, comme à une lumière qui brille dans l'obscurité\nlieu, jusqu'à ce que le jour se lève et que l'étoile du jour se lève dans vos cœurs  \n\nSachant ceci d'abord, qu'aucune prophétie de l'Écriture n'est d'aucune interprétation privée.  **\n\nCar la prophétie n'est pas venue autrefois par la volonté de l'homme, mais de saints hommes de Dieu ont parlé , poussés par le Saint-Esprit.  **\n\nVous savez très bien que les prophéties des temps anciens enregistrées dans les Écritures ont été données à la fois par des hommes et des femmes. La même chose est vraie des prophéties du Nouveau Testament. Par conséquent, la femme a le droit de dire la parole de Dieu aux hommes pour l'édification, l'exhortation et le réconfort dans l'église. Elle a le droit de dire la parole de Dieu dans l'église pour édifier les gens dans l'église, pour exhorter les gens dans l'église, qui est une congrégation mixte d'hommes et de femmes. Parce qu'elle a reçu la parole, elle a reçu la parole sûre de la prophétie, elle a reçu l'inspiration, elle a reçu l'appel, elle doit annoncer la parole à l'auditoire, afin que l'église puisse obéir au Seigneur.  **\n\nActes 26 versets 16 à 18    **\n\n«Mais lève-toi et tiens-toi sur tes pieds, car je t'ai apparu dans ce but, pour faire de toi un ministre et un témoin à la fois de ces choses que tu as vues et de celles dans lesquelles je t'apparaîtrai;\n\n\nTe délivrant du peuple et des Gentils vers lesquels je t'envoie maintenant,\n\nPour leur ouvrir les yeux et les faire passer des ténèbres à la lumière et de la puissance de Satan à Dieu, afin qu'ils reçoivent le pardon des péchés et l'héritage parmi les sanctifiés par la foi qui est en moi.  **\n\n\n4.4. La femme peut à la fois prêcher et enseigner   **\n\nCertains disent que la Bible dit qu'une femme peut prêcher mais pas enseigner. Ils n'ont pas la bonne compréhension de l'Écriture ci-dessous   **\n\n2 Timothée 2 verset 12    **\n\n\"Mais je ne permets pas à une femme d'enseigner, ni d'usurper l'autorité sur l'homme, mais d'être en silence.\"  **\n\nTout d'abord, permettez-moi d'attirer l'attention sur le fait que cette écriture est écrite dans un sens général et ne s'applique à aucune occasion spécifique. Sinon , cela signifiera que la femme ne peut se tenir devant aucun groupe de personnes dans l'église ou la société humaine à tout moment pour les enseigner. Comparons maintenant les écritures avec les écritures. Que veut dire l'Écriture quand elle dit dans Tite 2 versets 3 et 4 ?\n\n\"Les femmes âgées de même, qu'elles se conduisent comme il convient à la sainteté, non de faux accusateurs, peu adonnés à beaucoup de vin, enseignantes de bonnes choses…\"\n\nLa Bible dit qu'ils doivent enseigner le bien choses. \"Afin qu'elles apprennent aux jeunes femmes à être sobres, à aimer leurs maris, à aimer leurs enfants.\" Pouvez-vous voir maintenant? Est-ce que \"Je ne permets pas qu'une femme enseigne ni usurpe l'autorité sur l'homme\" signifie-t-il \"Laissez tout enseignements aux hommes ? Non! La Bible ne le dit pas. Ici, la Bible lui a donné la licence d'enseigner de \" bonnes choses \". Le salut est une bonne chose, le ciel est une bonne chose et le message de l'évangile est une bonne chose. Elle devrait enseigner aux autres qu'ils peuvent apprendre un bon caractère !  **\n\n\n4.5.\tLes femmes ne doivent pas usurper l'autorité sur les hommes   **\n\n\nRegardez en arrière sur ces écritures; vous verrez quelques traces qui ont fait que de telles instructions ont été données.  **\n\n1 Corinthiens 14 versets 33 à 35    **\n\n« Car Dieu n'est pas l'auteur de la confusion, mais de la paix, comme dans toutes les églises des saints.\n\nQue vos femmes se taisent dans les églises car il ne leur est pas permis de parler ; mais il leur est commandé d'être soumis, comme le dit aussi la loi.\n\nEt si elles veulent apprendre quelque chose, qu'elles demandent à leurs maris à la maison   car c'est une honte pour les femmes de parler dans l'église.  **\n\nSi vous prenez cela au pied de la lettre, vous empêcherez toutes les femmes de prophétiser parce que vous direz   « C'est un honte pour les femmes de parler dans l'église.\n\nVous arrêterez toutes leurs activités. Même les chansons qu'ils chantent dans l'église seront une honte. Quand les femmes chantent dans l'Église, voyez-vous vraiment cela comme une honte pour elles ? Nous devrions apprendre à interpréter l'Écriture. Lorsque des femmes témoignent dans l'église de la grâce et de la bonté du Seigneur dans leur vie, cela leur fait-il honte, à elles ou à l'église ?  **\n\nMaintenant, si vous regardez cette Écriture, vous verrez que certaines femmes semaient la confusion dans l'église, ce qui explique pourquoi l'apôtre a dit  \n\n« Dieu n'est pas l'auteur de la confusion » . Encore l'Ecriture dit que, \"Ils ne sont pas autorisés à parler, mais on leur ordonne d'être obéissants. \"Quelques les femmes étaient désobéissantes dans l'église; c'est pourquoi la loi est venue contrôler ces désobéissants. Et l'Ecriture dit aussi dans    **\n\n\n1 Corinthiens 14 verset 35,   **\n\n\"Si elles demandent quelque chose, qu'elles demandent à leur mari à la maison, car c'est une honte pour les femmes de parler dans l'église.\" Ça veut dire ces femmes désobéissantes font honte à l'église. Aucune femme juste ne causera la honte dans l'église. Aucune sainte femme ne fera honte à l'église. Ce sont les femmes indisciplinées et désobéissantes qui causent la honte, et dans ce cas, elles doivent être contrôlées. Les dirigeants doivent limiter leur liberté dans l'église pour assurer la paix de l'église. Dieu est l'auteur de la paix.  **\n\nDe plus, certaines femmes exerçaient une autorité charnelle sur leurs maris et d'autres hommes. Ils étaient charnels, et non dirigés par Dieu ou inspirés par Dieu. En usant de l'autorité charnelle sur les hommes, ils leur ont détourné le pouvoir. C'est pourquoi Paul a dit que de telles femmes devraient être contrôlées parce qu'elles sèment la confusion dans l'église.  **\n\n Premier Timothée 2 versets 12 à 14    **\n\n« Mais je ne souffre pas qu'une femme enseigne, ni qu'elle usurpe l'autorité sur l'homme, mais qu'elle soit en silence. Car Adam a d'abord été formé, puis Eve. Et Adam n'a pas été trompé, mais la femme trompée était dans la transgression.  ** \n\nTu vois cela? Je ne permets pas à une femme d'enseigner ni d' usurper ( ou de détourner l'autorité ou le pouvoir des hommes). L'action \"enseigner\" ci-dessus n'est pas quelque chose qui est fait dans la droiture et par inspiration divine, mais quelque chose qui est fait avec force et à tort dans la chair. Cela montre qu'elle utilise l'autorité charnelle et un faux zèle pour détourner le contrôle des hommes. Elle est en avant; et utilise sa propriété naturelle en tant que femme pour diriger avec force les hommes. C'est dangereux ! Car Adam n'était pas dans la transgression. C'est l'avancée d'Eve qui a donné à Satan la chance de faire s'effondrer leur\nrelation avec Dieu dans le jardin d'Eden.  **\n\nPar conséquent, si vous permettez à une femme d'utiliser ses émotions charnelles et ses pouvoirs féminins pour prendre le dessus sur les hommes, le système de l'église s'effondrera. Par conséquent, ces êtres charnels doivent être gardés silencieux et soumis. Adam a d'abord été formé, alors pourquoi usurpe-t-elle l'autorité sur l'homme ? Comme nous pouvons le voir, ce sont les femmes impies qui ont fait apparaître ces commandements, pas les femmes saintes, pas les femmes justes, pas les femmes conduites par l'Esprit de Dieu. Par conséquent, cette règle ne s'applique pas lorsque la femme concernée est née de nouveau et est sainte, étant appelée par Dieu et inspirée par le Saint-Esprit dans le service chrétien comme l'était Deborah.  **\n\nPremier Timothée 1 verset 9 à 11    **\n\n« Sachant ceci, que la loi n'est pas faite pour le juste, mais pour les impies et les désobéissants, pour les impies et pour les pécheurs, pour les impies et les profanes, pour les meurtriers de pères et les meurtriers de mères, pour les meurtriers,\n\n\nPour les impudiques, pour ceux qui se souillent avec l'humanité, pour les voleurs d'hommes, pour les menteurs, pour les parjures, et s'il y a autre chose qui est contraire à la saine doctrine ;\n\nSelon le glorieux évangile du Dieu béni, qui a été confié à ma confiance.  **\n   \n\nPar conséquent, la loi faite dans l'église contre les femmes n'est pas pour les justes et les saints, mais pour contrôler les désobéissants et les impies parmi eux. Les Écritures ouvrent une porte pleine de service à la femme. Elle est une compagne pour l'homme dans le monde séculier, dans le cercle familial, dans l'église et aussi dans les affaires spirituelles. Le Seigneur a fait d'elle une aide pour assister l'homme dans les activités qu'il fait, afin que le travail puisse être bien fait et très rapidement. Elle a donc un bon rôle à jouer dans l'église et dans le ministère chrétien.  **\n\nMaintenant femme, Dieu a ôté les obstacles qui te limitaient dans le Seigneur. Satan connaît la venue prochaine de Christ et veut priver le Seigneur de ses ouvriers . Il l'a fait à travers la tradition des hommes et la mauvaise interprétation des écritures. Maintenant que la vérité a été révélée, laissez la femme aller à fond dans son service au Seigneur, selon son appel divin sans aucune limitation.  **\n \nColossiens 2 verset 8 et 10    **\n\n« Prenez garde que personne ne vous gâte par la philosophie et par de vaines tromperies, selon la tradition des hommes, selon les rudiments du monde, et non selon Christ.\n\nEt vous êtes complets en lui, qui est le chef de toute principauté et puissance   »  **\n\n\n4.6. Une porte de service est entièrement ouverte aux femmes\n\nje t'ai aimé    **\n\nApocalypse 3 versets 7 à 9    **\n\n«Et à l'ange de l'église de Philadelphie, écris; Voici ce que dit celui qui est saint, celui qui est vrai, celui qui a la clef de David, celui qui ouvre et personne ne ferme ; et ferme , et personne n'ouvre ;\n\n\nJe connais tes oeuvres  voici, j'ai mis devant toi une porte ouverte, et personne ne peut la fermer, car tu as peu de force, et tu as gardé ma parole, et tu n'as pas renié mon nom.\n\nVoici, je ferai de ceux de la synagogue de Satan, qui se disent juifs, et ne le sont pas, mais qui mentent ; voici, je les ferai venir se prosterner devant tes pieds et savoir cela .  ** \n\nLes voies de Dieu ne sont pas les voies de l'homme ; Les pensées de Dieu ne sont pas les pensées de l'homme. Deborah, la femme de Lapidoth , était le chef d'Israël à cette époque. Deborah, la femme de Lapidoth, a apporté le réveil en Israël à cette époque. Elle a également jugé Israël en matière de justice à cette époque. Alléluia! C'est ce que Dieu veut que nous sachions tous. Il est le Dieu souverain. Les femmes chrétiennes mariées et célibataires devraient accepter l'appel divin et se lancer dans des exploits de la fin des temps pour Jésus-Christ.  **\n\n4.7.\tLaissons les femmes se comporter avec droiture envers leurs maris    **\n\nVous remarquerez dans les Écritures que Deborah n'a eu aucune crise avec son mari. Elle n'avait pas de problème conjugal ou familial. C'est parce qu'elle s'est acquittée fidèlement de ses obligations conjugales envers son mari. Elle l'aimait, se soumettait à lui et le vénérait. Son mari n'a pas été négligé ou méprisé à cause de son ministère.  **\n\nTite 2 versets 3 à 5    **\n\n\"Les femmes âgées de même, qu'elles se comportent comme il convient à la sainteté, et non fausses\naccusateurs, peu avides de vin, maîtres de bonnes choses ;\n\nAfin qu'elles apprennent aux jeunes femmes à être sobres, à aimer leurs maris, à aimer leurs enfants,\n\nÊtre discrets, chastes, gardiens de maison, bons, obéissants à leurs propres maris, afin que la parole de Dieu ne soit pas blasphémée.  **\n\nFemme chrétienne, pour prospérer dans votre ministère et se qualifier pour la récompense du Seigneur, il faut une sainteté de vie et de caractère, qui se manifeste par une bonne conduite envers votre mari. La chose la plus importante dans votre vie n'est pas le service chrétien oint, mais le caractère chrétien saint. Par conséquent, traitez bien votre mari et votre famille.  **\n\nPremier Pierre 3 versets 1 à 6    **\n\n« De même, femmes, soyez soumises à vos propres maris ; que, si quelqu'un n'obéit pas à la parole, il peut aussi, sans la parole, être gagné par la conversation des épouses ;\n\nPendant qu'ils voient votre conversation chaste couplée à la peur.\n\nDont la parure ne soit pas cette parure extérieure de tresser les cheveux, et de porter de l'or, ou de se vêtir ;\n\nMais que ce soit l'homme caché du cœur, dans ce qui n'est pas corruptible, même l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille, qui est aux yeux de Dieu d'un grand prix.\n\nCar de cette manière dans l'ancien temps aussi les saintes femmes, qui se confiaient en Dieu, se paraient elles-mêmes, étant soumises à leurs propres maris  \n\nDe même que Sara obéit à Abraham, l'appelant seigneur   dont vous êtes les filles, pourvu que vous agissiez bien et que vous n'ayez pas peur avec étonnement ».  **\n\n\nN'oubliez pas d'obéir à Dieu et de l'exalter au-dessus de votre mari en ce qui concerne votre vie chrétienne et votre ministère. Soyez prête à souffrir sous un mari incrédule et difficile qui résiste à votre vie chrétienne et à votre engagement dans le ministère. Cela ne vous dérange pas d'être chassé du mariage à cause de Jésus et de son œuvre.  **\n  \n\nPremier Pierre 4 verset 12 à 16   **\n  \n\"Bien-aimé, ne trouve pas étrange l'épreuve ardente qui va t'éprouver, comme s'il t'arrivait quelque chose d'étrange  \n\nMais réjouissez-vous, car vous participez aux souffrances de Christ; afin que, lorsque sa gloire sera révélée, vous vous réjouissiez aussi d'une joie extrême.\n\nSi l'on vous reproche le nom de Christ, heureux êtes-vous ; car l'esprit de gloire et de Dieu repose sur vous   de leur part, il est malmené, mais de votre part , il est glorifié.\n\n\nMais qu'aucun de vous ne souffre comme meurtrier, ou comme voleur, ou comme malfaiteur, ou comme s'ingérant dans les affaires d'autrui.\n\nPourtant, si quelqu'un souffre en tant que chrétien, qu'il n'ait pas honte; mais qu'il glorifie Dieu à ce sujet.  **\n\n\nMatthieu 10 versets 33 à 39    **\n \n« Mais quiconque me reniera devant les hommes, je le renierai aussi devant mon Père qui est dans les cieux.\n\nNe pensez pas que je sois venu apporter la paix sur la terre ; Je ne suis pas venu envoyer la paix, mais une épée.\n\nCar je suis venu opposer l'homme à son père, et la fille à sa mère, et la belle-fille à sa belle-mère .\n\nEt les ennemis d'un homme seront ceux de sa propre maison.\n\nCelui qui aime son père ou sa mère plus que moi n'est pas digne de moi, et celui qui aime son fils ou sa fille plus que moi n'est pas digne de moi.\n\n\nEt celui qui ne prend pas sa croix et me suit n'est pas digne de moi.\n\nCelui qui trouvera sa vie la perdra et celui qui perdra sa vie à cause de moi la retrouvera.  **\n\n\nSoyez humble et obéissant, soyez audacieux, courageux et sage. Permettez-vous à votre mari ou à votre mariage de détruire votre âme.\n\nLa soumission de votre mari à Dieu est requise pour votre pleine soumission à lui. Se soumettre à sa règle impie, c'est l'exalter au-dessus de Dieu et en faire votre idole !  **\n\nJacques 1 verset 2 à 8    **\n\n« Mes frères, comptez toute joie lorsque vous tombez dans diverses tentations ;\n\nSachant ceci, que l'épreuve de votre foi produit la patience.\n\nMais laissez la patience faire son œuvre parfaite, afin que vous soyez parfaits et entiers, ne manquant de rien.\n\n\nSi quelqu'un d'entre vous manque de sagesse, qu'il la demande à Dieu, qui donne à tous libéralement et sans reproche ; et il lui sera donné.\nMais laisse-le questionner en confiance, sans l'agiter. Car celui qui vacille est comme une vague de la mer poussée par le vent et agitée.\n\nCar que cet homme ne pense pas qu'il recevra quelque chose du Seigneur.\n\nUn homme irrésolu est instable dans toutes ses voies.  **\n\nCHAPITRE CINQ   **\n\nDEBORAH ETAIT UNE FEMME COURAGEUSE ET UN VAISSEAU PRATIQUE ENTRE LES MAINS DE DIEU   **\n\nUne autre raison pour laquelle Deborah est devenue utile car la mission divine était due au fait qu'aucun homme n'était assez courageux pour prendre l'initiative de délivrer le peuple des mains de ses oppresseurs. Le cœur de tous les hommes fondit devant leurs ennemis. Cela a poussé Dieu à se tourner vers une femme pour le réveil de son peuple.  **\n\nJuges 5 versets 1 à 2, 6 à 7    **\n\n\"Alors chantèrent Débora et Barak, fils d' Abinoam , en ce jour-là, disant  \n\nAu temps de Shamgar, fils d' Anath , au temps de Jaël, les routes étaient désertes, et les voyageurs passaient par des chemins détournés.\n\nLes habitants des villages ont cessé, ils ont cessé en Israël, jusqu'à ce que moi, Deborah, je sois ressuscitée , que je sois devenue une mère en Israël.  **\n\n\"Jusqu'à ce que je Deborah se leva.\" Était-elle fière ? Non, elle n'était pas fière. Elle nous révélait que Dieu peut utiliser les femmes pour son œuvre, tout comme il utilise les hommes. Par conséquent, les femmes devraient être préparées pour le service de Dieu à quelque titre que ce soit selon sa volonté et son appel, même si la Bible les reconnaît comme des vases plus faibles.  **\n\n5.1\tLes femmes ne sont pas faibles entre les mains de Dieu   **\n\n\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 7    **\n\n« De même, vous les maris, demeurez avec eux selon la connaissance, donnant honneur à la femme, comme au vase le plus faible, et comme étant héritiers ensemble de la grâce de la vie ; afin que vos prières ne soient pas entravées.  **\n\nLes gens poussent trop loin cette phrase « Comme pour le vaisseau le plus faible ». Ils utilisent cette déclaration pour mépriser les femmes. Ils donnent l'impression que les femmes ne peuvent pas prêcher, ne peuvent pas être pasteurs, ne peuvent pas répondre aux besoins spirituels des frères dans l'église. Mais Dieu dans Sa sagesse contredit de tels préjugés masculins et a choisi d'utiliser Deborah en son temps pour prendre le dessus sur les hommes !  **      \n\nPremier Corinthiens.1 verset 27 à 31    **\n\n« Mais Dieu a choisi les choses folles du monde pour confondre les sages ; et Dieu a choisi les choses faibles du monde pour confondre les choses fortes ;\n\nEt les choses viles du monde, et les choses qui sont méprisées, Dieu les a choisies, oui, et les choses qui ne sont pas, pour anéantir celles qui sont ;\n\nQu'aucune chair ne se glorifie en sa présence.\n\n\nMais vous êtes de lui en Jésus-Christ, qui de Dieu nous a été fait sagesse, et justice, et sanctification, et rédemption ;\n\nQue, selon qu'il est écrit, Celui qui se glorifie , qu'il se glorifie dans le Seigneur.  **\n\n\n5.2 Dieu peut utiliser un vase faible pour confondre le fort   **\n\n\nImaginez ce que Deborah a accompli à son époque où les hommes avaient peur, quand les hommes s'enfuyaient et quand les hommes dormaient. Notre époque n'est-elle pas semblable à celle de Deborah ? Quand vous regardez les églises aujourd'hui, ne voyez-vous pas l'ère de Deborah se reproduire ? Ne voyez-vous pas l'époque de Deborah reproduite à notre époque ? Quand vous regardez la société, que voyez-vous ? Vous ne voyez pas le même problème ? Lorsque vous entrez dans l'église le jour du culte, regardez autour de vous et voyez le ratio hommes/femmes. N'est-ce pas une preuve que les jours de Deborah sont là ? N'est-ce pas une preuve que les hommes ont peur, que les hommes sont loin de Dieu, que les hommes dorment dans le péché ? C'est quand les gens s'endorment que les ennemis font leur travail.  **          \n\nMatthieu 13 versets 25 à 27    **\n\n\"Mais quand la lame s'éleva et produisit du fruit, alors apparut aussi l'ivraie.\n\nAlors les serviteurs du maître de maison vinrent et lui dirent   Seigneur, n'as-tu pas semé de la bonne semence dans ton champ ? d'où vient donc l'ivraie ?\n\nQuand les hommes s'endorment, les ennemis vont faire le mal. Alors Dieu dit maintenant, Au fait, est-ce seulement des hommes que je créé? J'ai créé les femmes aussi et si les hommes ont eu peur, je ressusciterai les femmes.  **\n\n\nN'a-t-il pas dit dans Luc 19 verset 40   « Je vous dis que, si ceux-ci se taisaient, les pierres crieraient aussitôt ?\n\nMême des pierres ! Femme, la transformation entre dans ta vie ! Le Dieu du ciel vous ressuscitera pour son nom et les gens entendront votre histoire de réveil.\n\nLorsque le Seigneur a dit à Moïse de dire au peuple d'Israël qu'il mangerait de la viande, Moïse a répondu      **\n\nNombres 11 versets 21 à 22    **\n\n« Le peuple, parmi lequel je suis, est de six cent mille fantassins ; et tu as dit  Je leur donnerai de la viande, afin qu'ils mangent tout un mois.\n\nLes brebis et les boeufs seront-ils tués pour eux, pour leur suffire ? ou tous les poissons de la mer seront-ils rassemblés pour eux, pour leur suffire ?\n\nEt l'Éternel dit à Moïse   La main de l'Éternel est-elle devenue courte ? tu verras maintenant si ma parole s'accomplira ou non pour toi.  **\n\nQue personne ne doute de ce que Dieu utilisera les femmes pour faire en cette fin des temps par le Saint-Esprit. Dieu, le créateur des femmes, est celui qui parle. L'appel de Dieu sur les femmes est ce que j'apporte à votre connaissance. Je dis aux femmes de se lever pour cet appel de Dieu parce que la plupart des hommes dans les églises locales sont devenus captifs du péché et de Satan.  **  \n\n\n5.3. Beaucoup d'églises ne s'en soucient plus Le paradis ou l'enfer   **\n\nIl n'y a plus de crainte de Dieu dans de nombreuses églises. Dans certaines églises locales, les pasteurs et les anciens de l'église s'engagent dans des combats physiques. Avez-vous déjà été témoin ou entendu parler de cela? L'abomination est allée loin; aucune crainte de Dieu dans les églises. Ils ne croient plus en Jésus. Les prédicateurs eux-mêmes sont des incroyants. Les évêques et les pasteurs concoctent des plans ensemble pour tuer un messager que Jésus envoie avec le message de justice, de sainteté et de vérité.  **        \n\nLuc 12 versets 15 à 21    **\n\n« Et il leur dit   Prenez garde, et gardez-vous de la convoitise ; car la vie d'un homme ne consiste pas dans l'abondance des choses qu'il possède .\nEt il leur dit une parabole, disant  Le sol d'un homme riche a produit en abondance;\n\nEt il pensa en lui-même, disant   Que dois-je faire, parce que je n'ai pas de place pour donner mes fruits ?\n\nEt il dit  Voici ce que je ferai  j'abattrai mes greniers et j'en bâtirai de plus grands; et là je donnerai tous mes fruits et mes biens.\n\nEt je dirai à mon âme   Âme, tu as beaucoup de biens amassés pour de nombreuses années ; repose-toi, mange, bois et réjouis-toi.\n\nMais Dieu lui dit   Toi , insensé, cette nuit ton âme te sera redemandée ; alors à qui seront ces choses que tu as pourvues ?\n\nIl en est de même de celui qui amasse un trésor pour lui-même et qui n'est pas riche envers Dieu. ”  **\n\nLe ciel n'est plus la priorité de la plupart des églises. J'ai entendu dire qu'un évêque en particulier avait invité des gens dans un manoir fantastique qu'il avait construit et qui était décrit comme \"le paradis sur terre\". Alors qu'il leur faisait faire le tour , il dit   « C'est pourquoi je ne pense pas à aller au ciel maintenant. Comment puis-je avoir toutes ces choses et penser à aller au ciel maintenant ? Exactement! Ils ne pensent pas à aller au ciel. Ils ont assez de richesses que Satan leur a données. Satan leur a dit   « Je ferai toutes ces choses donne-toi, si tu veux te prosterner et m'adorer . » ( Matthieu 4 verset 9).\n\nIls sont « arrivés », donc ils ne pensent plus au paradis.  **\n\nDe plus, ils ne sont pas non plus conscients de la possibilité d'aller en enfer. C'est la situation de nombreux dirigeants, pasteurs et membres d'églises. Si vous allez leur dire   « Cette chose vous mènera au feu de l'enfer. Arrête ça.\" Ils riront et vous diront   « Qui es-tu pour juger le serviteur d'un autre homme ? La Bible dit   « Ne jugez pas ! Il apporta le message du feu de l'enfer aux petits enfants et leur enseigna les conséquences éternelles du péché. Il les a mis en garde contre les comportements pécheurs, qui les conduiraient en enfer. Les enfants ont commencé à demander   « Mon oncle, le feu de l'enfer ? Où est-il?\" C'est parce qu'ils adoraient dans une église où le feu de l'enfer n'a jamais été prêché ni enseigné.   **                                                                                                                                                                                          \n\nUn homme qui fréquente cette église m'a appelé et m'a dit   « Depuis onze ans que je suis dans cette église, je n'ai jamais entendu de message sur le retour de Jésus. Non! Je ne l'ai jamais entendu prêcher dans l'église. C'est un prédicateur invité de quelque part qui nous a dit que Jésus reviendrait bientôt. « C'est la situation de beaucoup d'églises. Ils sont complètement perdus ! Ils ne sont pas conscients de l'enfer et ne s'en soucient pas. En fait, il n'est pas dans leur cœur de prêcher ou de vivre selon la vraie parole de Dieu. Ce qu'ils prêchent, c'est la science humaine et la philosophie. Comment devenir riche, et comment vivre en paix, et progresser. Ils utilisent des mots séduisants de la sagesse de l'homme.  **\n\nColossiens 2 verset 8    **\n\nPrenez garde qu'aucun homme ne vous gâte par la philosophie et par de vaines tromperies, d'après la tradition des hommes, d'après les rudiments du monde, et non d'après Christ.  **\n\nIls prêchent sur la malédiction générationnelle, allant dans les maisons des gens pour les délivrer de la malédiction générationnelle ; montrant que leur croyance en Jésus n'est pas suffisante. Ils disent  «Votre arrière-grand-père, décédé il y a 100 ans, avait un contrat avec Satan et en fait, si vous n'allez pas pour cette génération, maudissez la délivrance…., en fait, c'est la raison pour laquelle vous n'êtes pas marié. \"Ils corrompent les croyants en prêchant \"l'évangile selon l'argent\". Ils font payer cher les gens pour la prière de délivrance et pour tout ce qu'ils désirent de Dieu.  **\n \nPremier Timothée 6 verset 7 à 11   **\n\n7 Car nous n'avons rien apporté dans ce monde, et il est certain que nous ne pouvons rien emporter.\n\n8 Et ayant de la nourriture et des vêtements, soyons satisfaits de cela.\n\n9 Mais ceux qui veulent devenir riches tombent dans la tentation et dans un piège, et dans beaucoup de convoitises folles et nuisibles, qui noient les hommes dans la destruction et la perdition.\n\n10 Car l'amour de l'argent est la racine de tout mal   que certains convoitaient, ils ont égaré la foi et se sont percés de beaucoup de douleurs.\n\n11 Mais toi, homme de Dieu, fuis ces choses ; et recherchez la justice, la piété, la foi, l'amour, la patience, la douceur.  **\n\n\n5.4 \tHypocrisie et Tromperie dans l'Église   **\n\nCombien d'églises sont exemptes d'hypocrisie et de tromperie ? Des choses sont enterrées dans leur autel pour manipuler les membres. Cela me rappelle l'histoire d'un homme que j'ai entendu vivre en Afrique du Sud. Il a câblé un coin de son salon avec un câble électrique ouvert dissimulé qui donne un léger choc électrique à toute personne qui vient autour de la place. Chaque fois que des gens viennent le voir pour se faire baptiser du Saint-Esprit, il les invite chez lui pour des prières spéciales et leur dit   « C'est une chose simple que de recevoir le baptême du Saint-Esprit. Allez simplement dans ce coin et commencez à prier pour le baptême du Saint-Esprit. Pendant que la prière est en cours, il entre à l'intérieur et allume le courant du fil dissimulé et dès qu'ils commencent à ressentir de légères décharges électriques, il dit   « Oui, c'est le Saint-Esprit ? . Prononcez tous les mots illisibles. C'est le baptême du Saint-Esprit.\n\nFantôme sacré? Je vous le dis, ce peuple est allé loin. C'est pourquoi vous voyez des pécheurs parler en \"langues\" maintenant. Ils ne connaissent pas Jésus et pourtant ils parlent en langues. La justice n'est pas dans leur église, pourtant ils parlent en langues. D'où l'ont-ils obtenu? L'électricité du \"Saint-Esprit\" ! C'est ce qui se passe maintenant. Le satanisme et la sorcellerie ont pris le dessus. Les jeunes et les enfants sont en grand danger d'initiation à la sorcellerie dans l'église !  **\n\nActes 8 verset 9 à 11   **\n \n9 Mais il y avait un certain homme, appelé Simon, qui auparavant dans la même ville usait de sorcellerie, et ensorcelait les habitants de Samarie, faisant croire que lui-même était quelqu'un de grand.\n\n\n10 A qui ils ont tous prêté attention, depuis le plus petit jusqu'au plus grand, en disant   Cet homme est la grande puissance de Dieu.\n\n11 Et ils avaient de l'estime pour lui, parce que depuis longtemps il les avait ensorcelés par des sortilèges.  **\n\nDieu nous a donné plus de temps pour travailler et faire avancer les choses très rapidement. Les quelques justes traversent une grande oppression et persécution. On a dit aux maris de torturer leurs épouses croyantes pour s'assurer que toute cette sainteté et cette droiture ne continuent pas. En fait , dans l'une des églises de l'État du Plateau, au Nigeria, lors de leur service de sainte communion, ils ont annoncé   « Toutes les femmes qui ont retiré leurs boucles d'oreilles doivent les mettre, sinon elles ne participeront pas à cette sainte communion. « Quelle bataille concrète contre la sainteté !  **\n\n\n\nDe nombreux pasteurs et anciens ne connaissent pas Jésus    **\n\nJérémie 2 verset 8   **\n\n8 Les sacrificateurs n'ont pas dit   Où est l'Éternel ? et ceux qui manient la loi ne M'ont pas connu; les pasteurs aussi ont transgressé contre moi, et les prophètes ont prophétisé par Baal, et ont marché après des choses qui ne profitent pas.  **\n\nLes pasteurs et les anciens ne connaissent pas le Seigneur ni Ses voies. Le pouvoir avec lequel ils travaillent est un pouvoir satanique, et ils s'évangélisent les uns les autres, se rendant à la plage pour rencontrer les esprits des sirènes. Plus un pasteur prend de convertis à Satan pour recevoir le pouvoir démoniaque, plus il devient grand dans le satanisme.  **\n\nLe Seigneur a donné une révélation de l'une de ces grandes églises. L'église est divisée en deux pendant le service. Un côté du bâtiment est dédié au culte de Dieu tandis que l'occultisme se poursuit de l'autre côté. Le bâtiment a un appartement souterrain. Le pasteur fait la navette d'un côté à l'autre menant des activités !  **\n\nMatthieu 15 versets 7 à 9    **\n\n« Hypocrites, Ésaïe a bien prophétisé à votre sujet, en disant  \n\nCe peuple s'approche de moi de sa bouche et m'honore de ses lèvres; mais leur cœur est loin de Moi.  **\n\nMais c'est en vain qu'ils m'adorent, enseignant comme doctrines mes commandements ».   **\n\nLa révélation a montré l'un des membres disant  «Vous savez ce qui se passe, c'est que le fait d'aller chez le sorcier est une chose publique et cela fait honte aux gens. En conséquence, les affaires de sorcier ont maintenant été transférées à l'église. Nous venons en tant qu'adorateurs dans l'église, mais passons du côté occulte. Certains dans cette même église ne sont pas au courant.  **\n\n2 Timothée 2 verset 22    **\n\n« Fuyez aussi les convoitises de la jeunesse ; mais suivez la justice, la foi, la charité, la paix, avec ceux qui invoquent le Seigneur d'un cœur pur.  **\n\n\nC'est ce qui se passe dans beaucoup de ces églises. Dans cette église, certains adorent, pensant qu'ils adorent Dieu. Dieu peut-il être à cet endroit ? La Bible dit, Satan et Jésus peuvent-ils être dans le même temple ?  **\n\n2 Corinthiens 6 versets 14 à 18    **\n\n« Ne soyez pas sous un joug inégal avec les incroyants ; car quelle relation y a-t-il entre la justice et l'injustice ? et quelle communion a la lumière avec les ténèbres ?\n\nEt quel accord Christ a-t-il avec Bélial ? ou quelle part a celui qui croit avec un infidèle?\n\n\nEt quel accord le temple de Dieu a-t-il avec les idoles ? car vous êtes le temple du Dieu vivant; comme Dieu l'a dit, j'habiterai en eux et je marcherai en eux; et je serai leur Dieu, et ils seront mon peuple.\n\nC'est pourquoi, sortez du milieu d'eux, et séparez-vous, dit le Seigneur, et ne touchez pas à ce qui est impur; et je te recevrai,\n\nEt vous serez un père, et vous serez mes fils et mes filles, dit le Seigneur tout-puissant. ”  **\n\nMais beaucoup d'églises sont comme des brebis sans berger. Dieu fait maintenant appel aux femmes, car les hommes sont partis, ils ont été dépassés, ils sont devenus très peu nombreux en sa présence. Élie pensait qu'il était le seul prophète de Dieu qui restait, mais le Seigneur lui a dit qu'il y en avait 7 000 de plus. Mais combien étaient 7000 dans toute la nation d'Israël ? C'est donc le cas maintenant. Les justes en Christ sont trop peu nombreux !  **\n\n\n\n\nCHAPITRE SIX   **\n\nFEMME! DIEU VEUT VOUS UTILISER   **\n\nfemme, ne laisse pas la tradition des hommes vous gêner. Acceptez l'appel de Dieu et levez-vous pour Son œuvre.  **\n \nExode 3 verset 2 à 10    **\n\n« Et l'ange de l'Éternel lui apparut dans une flamme de feu, du milieu d'un buisson ; et il regarda, et voici, le buisson brûlait de feu, et le buisson ne se consumait pas.\n\n\nEt Moïse dit   Je vais maintenant me détourner, et voir ce grand spectacle, pourquoi le buisson n'est pas brûlé.\n\n\nEt quand l'Éternel vit qu'il s'était détourné pour voir, Dieu l'appela du milieu du buisson, et dit   Moïse, Moïse. Et il dit   Me voici .\n\nEt il dit  N'approche pas d'ici; ôte tes souliers de tes pieds, car le lieu sur lequel tu te tiens est une terre sainte.\n\nDe plus , il a dit   Je suis le Dieu de ton père, le Dieu d' Abraham, le Dieu d'Isaac et le Dieu de Jacob. Et Moïse cacha son visage; car il avait peur de regarder Dieu.\n\nEt l'Éternel dit  J'ai vu l'affliction de mon peuple qui est en Égypte, et j'ai entendu son cri à cause de ses bourreaux; car je connais leurs douleurs;\n\n8 Et je suis descendu pour les délivrer de la main des Égyptiens, et pour les faire monter de ce pays vers un bon et un grand pays, vers un pays où coulent le lait et le miel ; au lieu des Cananéens, des Hittites, des Amorites, des Perizzites, des Hivites et des Jébusites.\n\n\nMaintenant donc, voici, le cri des enfants d'Israël est venu à moi et j'ai aussi vu l'oppression dont les Égyptiens les oppriment.\n\nViens donc, et je t'enverrai vers Pharaon, afin que tu fasses sortir d'Égypte mon peuple, les enfants d'Israël.\n\nIci, Dieu s'adresse à Ses filles fidèles en disant   « Vous avez entendu et même vu cela. toi-même; vous connaissez l'oppression du diable et de ses démons contre mon peuple. Vous connaissez les difficultés dans lesquelles Satan a mis les gens et maintenant ils crient vers Moi. Ils soupirent pour le salut jour et nuit. Viens maintenant, ma fille, et je t'enverrai dans le champ de l'évangile pour amener ces gens du péché et de Satan à la vie éternelle en Christ.  *\n\nEsaïe 6 verset 8    **\n\n Et j'entendis la voix du Seigneur, disant   Qui enverrai-je, et qui ira pour nous ? Alors j'ai dit, ici suis- je; envoie-moi.\"  **\n\n\n6.1 \tCulte trompeur dans certaines églises   **\n\nQuelqu'un m'a raconté l'histoire d'un jeune qui appartenait à l'une de ces mauvaises églises. Son pasteur lui a dit   « Nous vous emmenons à notre siège à Abuja. Le garçon a voyagé joyeusement à Abuja avec d'autres personnes et est entré dans le bâtiment du siège. Je vous ai dit plus tôt que ce genre d'église est divisé en deux. L'église avait une section où les gens étaient gardés pour le sacrifice. Le garçon s'est retrouvé dans cette section. Il ne savait pas qu'il avait été amené pour le sacrifice. Puis un homme de sa propre tribu, qui était l'un des tueurs à gages de l'église, remarqua à l'accent du garçon qu'il était de sa tribu. En raison de ce lien tribal, il s'est senti obligé de sauver le garçon. Alors il révéla au garçon   « Tu es ici pour être sacrifié. Alarmé, le garçon s'est exclamé  \"Eh!\" L'homme a répété  \"Oui, vous êtes ici pour être sacrifié.\" Pendant ce temps, le culte se déroulait d'un côté du bâtiment et le sacrifice de l'autre côté. Une source d'eau peut-elle produire à la fois de l'eau douce et de l'eau amère ?  **\n\nJacques 3 verset 11    * *\n\n11 Une fontaine fait- elle jaillir au même endroit de l'eau douce et amère ?  **\n\nParadoxalement, c'est ce qui se passe actuellement dans de nombreuses églises. Il y a un camouflage qui cache beaucoup de choses terribles en dessous. Alors l'homme a montré au garçon le chemin de l'évasion.\n\nJ'ai vu l'affliction de mon peuple qui est en Égypte et je connais ses douleurs . C'est Dieu parler à ses filles. « J'ai vu le affliction de vos frères et je sais comment leurs pasteurs fiscalistes les oppriment. C'est pourquoi je suis descendu pour les délivrer; J'ai entendu leur cri, leur gémissement.\n\nQuand une vache est abattue, savez-vous comment elle gémit ? Combien plus quand un être humain est massacré et offert à Satan en sacrifice pour faire progresser l'église ! J'ai vu le gémissement de Mon peuple ! Venez donc, je vous enverrai vers Pharaon et vous ferez sortir mon peuple d'Egypte. C'est ce que te dit le Seigneur, femme.  **\n\n6.2.\tDieu accorde un soutien total aux femmes dans le ministère    **\n\nQuand Dieu a dit à Moïse   « Viens et j'enverrai à Pharaon », répondit Moïse   « Qui suis-je, pour aller vers Pharaon pour faire sortir d'Égypte les enfants d'Israël ?  **\n\nDe même, Dieu dit maintenant aux femmes   « J'ai enlevé cette tradition de votre chemin. La tradition qui vous fait dire « Qui suis-je ? Je suis juste une femme ? Le Seigneur a supprimé cette tradition. Il vous a montré Deborah comme exemple. Il a utilisé Deborah quand les hommes avaient peur, quand les hommes étaient loin de Lui, quand les hommes dormaient. Quand Moïse a dit   « Qui suis-je » quelle a été la réponse de Dieu ?  **\n\n\n\nExode 3 verset 11 à 12   **\n\n« Et Moïse dit à Dieu   Qui suis-je, pour que j'aille vers Pharaon, et que je fasse sortir d'Égypte les enfants d'Israël ?\n\n\nEt il dit  Certainement je serai avec toi; et ceci te sera un signe que je t'ai envoyé, quand tu auras fait sortir le peuple d'Égypte, tu serviras Dieu sur cette montagne.  **\n\nVotre ministère prospérera. Vous ferez sortir le peuple. Vous serez surpris de la foule que vous ferez sortir et ils viendront servir Dieu dans la montagne de la SAINTETE. Dieu dit, je sera avec vous; Moi, votre Dieu, je bénirai votre ministère. Amen.  **\n\nExode 3 versets 13 à 17    **\n\n« Et Moïse dit à Dieu   Voici, quand j'irai vers les enfants d'Israël, et que je leur dirai   Le Dieu de vos pères m'a envoyé vers vous ; et ils me diront   Quel est son nom ? que leur dirai-je ?\n\n\nEt Dieu dit à Moïse   JE SUIS CE QUE JE SUIS. Et il dit   Tu diras ainsi aux enfants d'Israël   JE SUIS m'a envoyé vers vous.\n\n\nEt Dieu dit encore à Moïse   Tu diras ainsi aux enfants d'Israël   L'Éternel, le Dieu de vos pères, le Dieu d'Abraham, le Dieu d'Isaac et le Dieu de Jacob, m'a envoyé vers vous   c'est mon nom. pour toujours, et ceci est Mon mémorial pour toutes les générations.\n\nVa, rassemble les anciens d'Israël, et dis-leur   L'Éternel, le Dieu de vos pères, le Dieu d'Abraham, d'Isaac et de Jacob, m'est apparu, disant   Je vous ai visités, et j'ai vu ce qui vous est fait en Egypte  \n\nEt j'ai dit   Je vous ferai monter de l'affliction de l'Égypte vers le pays des Cananéens, et des Hittites, et des Amoréens, et des Perizzites, et des Hivites, et des Jébuséens, vers un pays où coulent le lait et Miel.\"  **\n\nFille du Dieu Très-Haut, le Seigneur te dit ceci   « Va et dis-leur, moi le Seigneur Jésus, le Seigneur de l'église, est venu pour le réveil de la fin des temps. J'ai vu comment Mon peuple a été trompé et enfermé sous les pouvoirs d'évêques, de surveillants, de surintendants ; et les pouvoirs de Satan. J'ai vu comment ils ont été enfermés. J'ai vu comment ils traversent toutes sortes d'afflictions et comment ils souffrent de la faim et de la soif. Allez leur dire que je suis venu les préparer pour le ciel ; pour les emmener dans un pays où coulent le lait et le miel. Je suis venu leur donner la vie éternelle.  **\n\nJean 14 verset 2    **\n\n« Dans la maison de mon Père, il y a plusieurs demeures ; s'il n'en était pas ainsi, je vous l'aurais dit. Je vais préparer un emplacement pour vous.\"\n\n« Je suis venu leur donner des demeures dans les cieux ; pour les préparer à l'enlèvement afin qu'ils arrivent au ciel. Allez leur dire ceci, et s'ils demandent, 'Qui est l'autorité derrière vous ?' Dis-leur   'JE SUIS QUI JE SUIS, le Premier et le Dernier, l'Alpha et l'Oméga, le Commencement et la Fin est celui qui te soutient, femme ! C'est lui qui vous envoie ! C'est lui qui sera avec vous !  **\n\n\nExode 3 verset 18    **\n\n« Et ils écouteront ta voix, et tu viendras, toi et les anciens d'Israël, vers le roi d'Égypte, et vous lui direz   L'Éternel, le Dieu des Hébreux, s'est rencontré avec nous, et maintenant nous allons partir , nous te prions, voyage de trois jours dans le désert, afin que nous sacrifiions à l'Éternel, notre Dieu. ”  **\n\n6.3 \tLa puissance de Dieu reposera sur vous   **\n\nDieu dit   « Ils te croiront. Ne pas dites  'Je suis une femme ordinaire.' Je vais leur faire croire. Je les ferai s'incliner devant ton évangile, et alors toi et eux affronterez ces « forces pharaoniques » . 'Vous les affronterez et direz   'Laissez le peuple de Dieu libre'. « Vous lutterez avec eux ; vous lutterez avec des principautés et des puissances ; vous lutterez contre la méchanceté spirituelle dans les hauts lieux ; vous lutterez avec les dirigeants des ténèbres de ce monde. L'Éternel, qui est le grand Dieu, sera avec vous.  **\n\nExode 3 versets 19 à 20    **\n\nEt je suis sûr que le roi d'Égypte ne vous laissera pas partir, non, pas par une main puissante. Et j'étendrai ma main, et je frapperai l'Égypte de toutes mes merveilles que je ferai au milieu d'elle, et après cela il vous laissera partir.  **\n \n\nFemme, la puissance divine te suivra ; des signes et des prodiges vous suivront !  **\n\nLuc 10 verset 19   **\n\n\"Voici, je vous donne le pouvoir de marcher sur les serpents et les scorpions, et sur toute la puissance de l'ennemi et rien ne vous fera aucun mal.\"  **\n\nDieu dit, je sais que Satan et ses démons ne vous permettra pas. Cependant, J'étendrai Mon bras du jugement de la fin des temps sur Satan ; Je déverserai les pouvoirs de la fin des temps sur Satan et il vous permettra de partir. Ces hommes liés par lui sortiront de sa main au nom de Jésus ; ces femmes et ces enfants sous son oppression sortiront de sa main au nom de Jésus. Ce c'est ce que te dit le Seigneur, fille du Christ.  **\n\n\n6.4 \tDieu vous promet sa présence   **\n\nDeutéronome 31 verset 6    **\n\n«Soyez forts et d'un bon courage, ne craignez pas, n'ayez pas peur d'eux  car c'est l'Éternel, ton Dieu, qui va avec toi; Il ne te manquera pas, ni ne t'abandonnera.  **\n\nDieu va vous soutenir; il va vous soutenir par des signes et des prodiges, et cette œuvre sera accomplie. Le Seigneur a promis d'aller avec vous et de vous donner un succès certain. Il a promis de vous accompagner dans le ministère et d'accomplir ses signes et prodiges dans votre ministère. Le Seigneur convaincra le peuple; Il va leur faire croire ce que tu leur diras. Dieu obligera Pharaon à se plier à votre autorité. Vous conduirez certainement le peuple hors du péché et de la main de Satan vers la vérité, la justice et la sainteté de Dieu. Ils adoreront dans la beauté de sa sainteté. Ils posséderont les demeures du ciel, au nom de Jésus . Soyez courageux, audacieux et sage.  *\n\n\n6.5 \tDieu a beaucoup de monde à sauver   **\n\n\nActes 18 versets 9 à 10    **\n« Alors dit le Seigneur à Paul dans la nuit par une vision   N'aie pas peur, mais parle, et ne te tais pas ;\n\nCar je suis avec toi, et personne ne s'attaquera à toi pour te faire du mal, car j'ai beaucoup de monde dans cette ville.  **\n\nLe Seigneur a beaucoup de gens dans votre nation, beaucoup de gens dans votre église locale, beaucoup de gens dans votre église dénominationnelle à sauver. Le Seigneur a beaucoup de monde en ce temps de la fin à faire entrer dans son royaume. N'ayez pas peur, allez-y; rien ne vous arrivera. Ne craignez pas le policier; ne craignez pas le gouvernement; ne craignez pas l'autorité de l'église ; ne craignez pas le Sanhédrin ; ne craignez pas les pharisiens, et ne craignez personne. Le Dieu du ciel dit, je serai avec vous. Vous serez réussir ce travail ! C'est ce qu'est le Seigneur en disant. Par conséquent, soyez audacieux; j'ai beaucoup de gens à qui sauver, beaucoup de gens à livrer, beaucoup de gens à racheter.  **\n\nPrenez cette commission au sérieux et poursuivez-la jusqu'à l'exécution finale. Ne laissez pas la coutume et la tradition des hommes contre les femmes vous dissuader de cet appel au réveil mondial. Deborah était une femme comme vous, pourtant elle a apporté le réveil à sa nation. C'était une prophétesse; Hulda était également une prophétesse et a apporté le réveil au pays d'Israël. Vous aussi apporterez le réveil à votre pays, à votre nation, à votre église et à votre communauté et au monde en général. Est-ce une chose difficile ? Est-ce une mauvaise chose ?    **\n\nMatthieu 9 verset 36 à 38    **\n« Mais quand il vit les multitudes, il fut ému de compassion pour elles, parce qu'elles s'évanouirent et furent dispersées comme des brebis sans berger.\n\nAlors il dit à ses disciples   La moisson est vraiment abondante, mais les ouvriers sont peu nombreux ;\n\nPriez donc le maître de la moisson, qu'il envoie des ouvriers dans sa moisson.  **\n\nLe Seigneur envoie des ouvriers maintenant. Alléluia! Ce sont des femmes ministres, ce sont les Deborah de notre temps, elles reprennent le flambeau. Venez, nous vous attendons, le travail est trop lourd pour nous, les vrais prédicateurs ne sont pas nombreux. Nous sommes trop peu nombreux, nous vous cherchons. Le Seigneur vous a appelé et vous a donné ce livre pour votre encouragement.  **\n\nMarc 16 versets 15 à 17    **\n\n« Et il leur dit   Allez par tout le monde, et prêchez l'Evangile à toute créature.\n\n\nCelui qui croira et sera baptisé sera sauvé; mais celui qui ne croira pas sera damné.\n\nEt ces miracles accompagneront ceux qui auront cru; En mon nom, ils chasseront les démons ; ils parleront de nouvelles langues ;  **\n\nQuel que soit le piège de l'ennemi, il ne réussira pas. Le Seigneur ira avec vous. Il accomplira des signes et des prodiges dans votre ministère. Les morts ressusciteront, les aveugles verront, les infirmes se lèveront et marcheront, les stériles enfanteront et les muets parleront. Recevez le pouvoir ! Allez travailler pour Jésus, allez sauver les gens.  **\n\n\n\nGalates 1 verset 15 à 16    **\n\n\"Mais quand il a plu à Dieu, qui m'a séparé dès le sein de ma mère et m'a appelé par sa grâce,\n\nPour révéler son Fils en moi, afin que je puisse le prêcher parmi les païens ; immédiatement je n'ai pas conféré avec la chair et le sang  \"   **\n\nCHAPITRE SEPT   **\n\nLE SEIGNEUR EST EN CHEMIN   **\n\nApocalypse 22 versets 12, 16 et 20    **\n\n« Et voici, je viens bientôt ; et ma récompense est avec moi, pour rendre à chacun selon ce que sera son oeuvre.\n\nMoi, Jésus, j'ai envoyé mon ange pour vous témoigner ces choses dans les églises. Je suis la racine et la postérité de David, et l'étoile brillante du matin.\n\nCelui qui atteste ces choses dit  Certes , je viens bientôt. Amen. De même, viens, Seigneur Jésus.  **\n\n\n7.1 Cette génération sera témoin de la Venue du Seigneur  **\n\nNous sommes à un moment crucial de l'histoire du monde. Quelque chose de spécial pour le peuple de Dieu et d'effroyable pour les pécheurs est sur le point de se produire. Maranatha ! Le Seigneur vient ! Amen. Cela cessera d'être un dicton qui semble n'avoir aucun sens. Ce sera bientôt un dicton d'une grande signification ; car il est certain que cette génération sera témoin de la venue du Seigneur face à face. Nous ne mourrons pas ; nous sommes la génération qui accueillera Jésus dans l'enlèvement. Et je vous salue, bien-aimés, de ravissement parce que je crois que vous êtes parmi ceux qui verront le Seigneur venir et sera transformé. Amen. Quelle grâce le Seigneur t'a-t-il faite de poser sa main sur toi, de s'intéresser à toi, de faire de toi l'un de ceux qu'il vient bientôt prendre au ciel ! Les justes dans le monde prient pour sa venue. Ils disent   « Seigneur, viens vite. Les saints qui sont au ciel soupirent aussi et demandent   « Seigneur, combien de temps faudra-t-il avant que nos frères viennent nous rejoindre ici ?  **\n\nApocalypse 6 verset 9    **\n\n« Et lorsqu'il eut ouvert le cinquième sceau, je vis sous l'autel les âmes de ceux qui avaient été immolés pour la parole de Dieu et pour le témoignage qu'ils détenaient ; Et ils crièrent d'une voix forte, disant   Jusques à quand, ô Seigneur, saint et véritable, ne jugeras-tu pas et ne vengeras-tu pas notre sang sur ceux qui habitent sur la terre ?  ** \n\n\n\"Combien de temps\"? Ils soupirent. \"Quand jugerez-vous le diable et finirez-vous tout?\" Et au verset 11, \"Et des robes blanches furent données à Chacun d'entre eux; et il leur fut dit qu'ils se reposeraient encore pendant un peu de temps, jusqu'à ce que leurs compagnons de service et leurs frères, qui devaient être tués comme eux, soient accomplis.  **\n\nIl y a un soupir dans le ciel. Ces écritures, bien sûr, seront dans les jours de tribulation. Mais même maintenant, nos frères qui sont montés au ciel soupirent pour nous sur terre, priant pour que nous montions au ciel et les rejoignions. La parole de Dieu confirme les événements de notre temps, montrant que ce sont des événements indiquant la venue du Seigneur, et qu'il viendra très bientôt. Maintenant que les événements s'accomplissent rapidement dans des successions rapides dans notre génération, sûrement, le Seigneur apparaît bientôt. Nous savons en étudiant le figuier que c'est le moment où le Seigneur vient chercher son peuple. Le Saint-Esprit par des révélations et des visites divines nous en a témoigné. Nos rêves et les soupirs de notre esprit confirment que notre temps est le temps de l'enlèvement. Maintenant, il y a une nuée de témoins témoignant chaque jour de l'enlèvement. Nous louons Dieu.  **\n\n\n7.2 \tMouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde Est configuré pour Rapture   **\n\nNous prêchons avec la conscience que notre génération est la génération du retour de Christ. Je prêche avec la conscience\nque je ne mourrai pas, mais que je serai vivant et que j'irai avec Christ dans l'enlèvement. Peut-être que le rêve que le Seigneur m'a donné en 1995 se réalisera dans ce ministère. Dans le rêve, je menais un groupe de personnes. J'ai vu des démons agenouillés, la tête inclinée devant nous, alors que nous chantions triomphalement la victoire du Christ. Soudain, l'enlèvement a eu lieu et nous nous sommes envolés pour rencontrer le Seigneur dans les airs. Ce rêve pourrait se réaliser dans HOREMOW. Louez le Seigneur ! Vous qui n'êtes pas prêt, préparez-vous. Ce réveil de la vérité, de la justice et de la sainteté que vous voyez maintenant remplira le monde. Cette petite chose que vous voyez, le petit feu qui vient d'être allumé, remplira le monde entier. Le Seigneur lui-même va le faire.  **\n\nPremiers Rois 18 versets 41 à 45    **\n\n«Et Élie dit à Achab  Lève-toi, mange et bois; car il y a un bruit de pluie abondante.\n\nAchab monta donc pour manger et pour boire. Et Elie monta au sommet du Carmel; et il se jeta à terre, et mit son visage entre ses genoux,\n\nEt dit à son serviteur   Monte maintenant, regarde vers la mer. Et il monta, et regarda, et dit   Il n'y a rien. Et il dit   Repars sept fois.\n\nEt il arriva, à la septième fois, qu'il dit  Voici, un petit nuage se lève de la mer, comme une main d'homme. Et il dit   Monte , dis à Achab   Prépare ton char, et descends, afin que la pluie ne t'arrête pas.\n\n\nEt il arriva, dans l' intervalle , que le ciel était noir de nuages et de vent, et il y eut une grande pluie. Et Achab monta à cheval et alla à Jizréel.  **\n\nLe Seigneur suscite des revivalistes pour faire revivre les églises à la vérité biblique, à la justice et à la sainteté avant l'enlèvement. Car cet évangile du royaume sera prêché dans le monde, puis la fin viendra.  **\n\nHébreux 12 verset 14    **\n\n\"Suivez la paix avec tous les hommes, et la sainteté, sans laquelle personne ne verra le Seigneur  \"  **\n\nPremier Jean 1 verset 3 à 7    **\n\n« Ce que nous avons vu et entendu, nous vous l'annonçons, afin que vous aussi soyez en communion avec nous   et vraiment notre communion est avec le Père et avec son Fils Jésus-Christ.\n\nEt nous t'écrivons ces choses, afin que ta joie soit parfaite.\n\nVoici donc le message que nous avons entendu de lui et que nous vous annonçons, que Dieu est lumière et qu'il n'y a en lui aucune ténèbres.\n\n\nSi nous disons que nous sommes en communion avec lui et que nous marchons dans les ténèbres, nous mentons et ne faisons pas la vérité  \n\nMais si nous marchons dans la lumière, comme il est dans la lumière, nous sommes en communion les uns avec les autres, et le sang de Jésus-Christ, son Fils, nous purifie de tout péché.  **\n\n\n2 Timothée 2 verset 22    **\n\n« Fuyez aussi les convoitises de la jeunesse, mais poursuivez la justice, la foi, la charité, la paix, avec ceux qui invoquent le Seigneur d'un cœur pur.  **\n\n7.3 Les femmes et les défis du passé Jours  **\n\nJe remercie Dieu d'avoir ouvert une grande porte du ministère aux femmes. Femme, le Seigneur t'a appelée à faire partie du ministère de la sainteté de la fin des temps. Vous devez vous réjouir que par la grâce de Dieu vous ayez été appelé au ministère de la sainteté comme les autres. Dieu va nous donner des hommes et des femmes saints et des matériaux chrétiens spécialement préparés pour vous former et mettre le feu dans votre vie, pour faire de vous un revivaliste efficace de la fin des temps. Vous devez être reconnaissant envers le Très-Haut . Ce sont les jours du réveil. C'est le temps du réveil pour le monde entier parce que le Seigneur vient. Mais alors, il y a un défi.  **\n\nLuc 18 verset 8   **\n\n« Je vous dis qu'il les vengera bientôt. Néanmoins, lorsque le Fils de l'homme viendra, trouvera-t-il la foi sur la terre ?  **\n\nLe Seigneur vient si vite, si soudainement, mais le monde n'est pas informé. Le monde autour de vous n'est pas conscient que le Seigneur vient. Votre nation n'est pas consciente ; les gens de votre communauté ne sont pas conscients que le Seigneur vient. Les gouvernements des nations n'en parlent pas parce qu'ils ne sont pas informés. Ce n'est pas à leur ordre du jour que Jésus vienne. C'est une terrible ignorance. Ne les rejoignez pas dans cette ignorance.  **\n\nMatthieu 24 verset 36 à 39    **\n\n«Mais personne ne connaît ce jour et cette heure, non, pas les anges du ciel, mais mon Père seul.\n\nMais comme furent les jours de Noé, ainsi sera aussi la venue du Fils de l'homme.\n\nCar, comme aux jours qui étaient avant le déluge, ils mangeaient et buvaient, se mariaient et donnaient en mariage, jusqu'au jour où Noé entra dans l'arche,\n\nEt ne le savait pas jusqu'à ce que le déluge soit venu et les ait tous emportés; ainsi en sera-t-il de la venue du Fils de l'homme.  **\n\nAu temps de Noé, quand Noé annonçait et prêchait que le monde serait détruit par l'eau, les gens ne s'en souciaient pas. Ils n'en étaient même pas conscients. Ils mangeaient et buvaient, célébraient des mariages, réalisaient de nombreux projets dans le monde. Ils étaient insouciants dans leur vie, jusqu'à ce que soudain, l'eau se mette à tomber du ciel et à jaillir du sol. C'est alors qu'ils sont devenus conscients. Mais les gens qui ont tenu compte de l'avertissement étaient déjà dans l'arche. Bien que le monde soit dans l'ignorance, vous devez être conscient et pleinement alerte de la venue de Jésus. Assurez-vous de rester dans l'arche. La justice et la sainteté doivent rester votre part au nom de Jésus .  **\n\nVos frères et sœurs ignorent ces choses ; ta mère ignore ces choses ; votre père ignore ces choses ; votre voisin ignore ces choses. C'est une triste vérité ! Mais Dieu merci, vous n'êtes pas ignorant. Peut-être que vous êtes comme Noé en train de pleurer, de crier et de leur prêcher, mais ils ne semblent pas vous entendre. Le fait qu'ils le méprisent ne signifie pas que cela n'arrivera pas. Le Seigneur viendra sûrement à notre époque. Gardez-vous pur. Quand Lot n'a pu gagner aucun corps à Sodome, il s'est gagné lui-même. Lorsque Lot n'a même pas pu récupérer ses gendres à Sodome, il a pu récupérer sa famille. Bien que la femme se soit perdue plus tard, il s'est retrouvé avec ses deux filles. Ainsi, pendant que vous prêchez et leur dites cela, et qu'ils endurcissent leur cœur ou se moquent de vous dans leur folie, assurez-vous de conserver votre droiture et votre sainteté.  **\nNous voyons le Seigneur s'approcher comme à la porte, mais beaucoup de nos bien-aimés et connaissances ne sont pas encore en Christ. La situation est comme être dans la salle d'examen et tout le monde est avec sa propre feuille d'écriture en préparation pour l'examen, mais voici un précieux ami à vous qui n'est pas dans la salle ! L'examinateur arrive déjà avec les questions à partager. Hélas, cet ami à vous n'est pas encore entré. Vous vous demandez ce qui se passe ? Où est-elle allée ? Pourquoi n'est-elle pas là ?  **\n\n\n\n7.4. Le défi des églises rétrogrades    **\n\nLe Seigneur vient; le Seigneur est déjà à la porte mais il y a un autre défi. C'est le défi de l'église rétrograde ! Ce qu'ils font dans ces églises maintenant n'a aucun rapport avec le Seigneur, pourtant le Seigneur de l'église vient ramener Son peuple à la maison. Où est ta mère? Dans quelle église s'est-elle perdue ? Où est ton frère? Où s'est-il perdu ? Où sont vos enfants? Pourquoi votre mari tarde-t-il ? Quelle église a détourné son attention à ce moment crucial où le Seigneur est déjà à la porte ?     **\n\nLuc 18 versets 7 et 8    **\n\n« Et Dieu ne vengera-t-il pas ses propres élus, qui crient vers lui jour et nuit, bien qu'il tarde à les supporter ?\n\nJe vous dis qu'il les vengera bientôt. Néanmoins, quand le Fils de l'homme viendra, trouvera-t-il la foi sur la terre ?  **\n\nRegardez le Seigneur venir; regardez-le déjà à la porte! Où est la foi de l'église dans cette génération ? Trouvera-t-il la justice dans l'Église ? Trouvera-t-il la sainteté dans l'église ?\n\nSeigneur, ce problème est douloureux pour le cœur de tes enfants. Maintenant, vous venez pour l'église que vous avez fondée, il y a environ 2000 ans et c'est à cette époque qu'il y a tant de reculs parmi nous. C'est à cette époque qu'il y a de la corruption partout. Les églises sont dans diverses activités qui n'ont aucun rapport avec Dieu. Trouverez-vous la foi dans le monde ? Pas seulement une ville; le défi est mondial. De pays en pays, l'église est rétrograde ; l'église s'est éteinte; l'église est occupée à faire autre chose ! Ce qui se passe au nom de l'adoration n'a aucun rapport avec le Dieu saint. Pourquoi ces choses sont-elles si importantes à ce moment crucial de votre venue ?  **\nC'est un grand défi. La vraie foi pour la justice, la sainteté et le ciel est en train de disparaître des églises. Les ministres sont entrés dans l'erreur, les hérésies et l'alliance avec Satan. Les quelques êtres pieux sont sous de lourdes persécutions. Les méchants luttent, travaillant dur pour s'assurer qu'ils éteignent le feu des quelques restes pieux. C'est l'état de l'église. Quel grand défi !  **\n\n\n\nCHAPITRE HUIT   **\n\nAUGMENTATION DU TEMPO DES ACTIVITÉS SATANIQUES SUR TERRE   **\n\nSatan est plus conscient de la brièveté de temps que beaucoup de chrétiens. Il comprend les temps plus que beaucoup d'entre nous. Satan lit l'écriture manuscrite et connaît le temps, alors il travaille très dur, 24 heures sur 24. Satan a assigné des agents sur votre vie pour s'assurer que vous n'allez pas au ciel. Il a soulevé des gens contre ce Mouvement de la Sainteté pour le renverser dès le début, mais Dieu ne l'a pas permis. Il a planifié de nombreuses stratégies contre le Mouvement et ses dirigeants et depuis lors, il n'a pas cédé. Il est toujours sur la planche à dessin en train de planifier d'autres stratégies qu'ils doivent employer pour arrêter ce travail, mais par la grâce de Dieu, ils continueront d'échouer.  **\n\nEphésien 6 versets 10 à 20    **\n\n« Enfin, mes frères, soyez forts dans le Seigneur et dans la puissance de sa puissance.\n\nRevêtez toute l'armure de Dieu, afin que vous puissiez résister aux ruses du diable.\n\nCar nous ne luttons pas contre la chair et le sang, mais contre les principautés, contre les puissances, contre les princes des ténèbres de ce monde, contre la méchanceté spirituelle dans les hauts lieux.\n\nC'est pourquoi, prenez toute l' armure de Dieu, afin que vous puissiez résister au mauvais jour et, après avoir tout fait, tenir bon.\n\n\nTenez donc debout, ayant pour ceinture vos reins la vérité, et portant la cuirasse de la justice;\n\nEt vos pieds chaussés de la préparation de l'évangile de paix;\n\nSurtout, prenez le bouclier de la foi, avec lequel vous pourrez éteindre tous les traits enflammés des méchants.\n\nEt prenez le casque du salut et l'épée de l'Esprit, qui est la parole de Dieu  \n\nPriant toujours avec toute prière et supplication dans l'Esprit, et veillant à cela avec toute persévérance et supplication pour tous les saints;\n\nEt pour moi, afin que la parole me soit donnée, afin que j'ouvre ma bouche hardiment, pour faire connaître le mystère de l'évangile,\n\nPour laquelle je suis ambassadrice en obligations  \nqu'en cela je puisse parler hardiment, comme je dois parler.  **\n\nNotre foi est en notre Dieu. C'est pourquoi j'ai dit aux frères du Holiness Revival Movement de ne pas se vanter de cette affaire. Ce n'est pas une question d'orgueil, car ce n'est pas de l'homme. Ce n'est pas le nom d'un ministère qui sauve, mais la grâce de Dieu en lui ; ce n'est pas non plus le genre de leader sur le ministère. Ne dites pas que nous y parviendrons grâce à l'homme que Dieu nous a donné dans le Mouvement de Réveil de la Sainteté. Est-ce ce petit moi dont tu te vantes ? Non, cela va au-delà, c'est en Dieu Lui-même que nous devons tous faire confiance !  **\n\nJ'ai dit un jour que je me voyais au-dessus du Holiness Movement comme le troisième capitaine des cinquante. Le premier capitaine et ses cinquante hommes ont été envoyés pour arrêter Elijah alors qu'il était sur la montagne, mais cela s'est soldé par un grand désastre.  **\n\nDeuxième Rois 1 verset 9 et 10    **\n\n« Alors le roi lui envoya un capitaine de cinquante avec ses cinquante. Et il monta vers lui, et voici, il était assis au sommet d' une colline. Et il lui dit   Homme de Dieu, le roi a dit   Descends.\n\nEt Élie répondit et dit au capitaine des cinquante   Si je suis un homme de Dieu, que le feu descende du ciel et te dévore, toi et tes cinquante. Et un feu descendit du ciel, et le dévora, lui et ses cinquante. ”  **\n\n\nLe deuxième capitaine est également venu avec ses cinquante hommes mais il n'a pas appris sa leçon. Lui aussi était fier. Il pensait que le problème était lié au port de l'uniforme. Il pensait que l'affaire était au pouvoir du roi, un être humain. Il est venu à Elie et a donné son ordre.  **\n\nDeuxième Rois 1 verset 11 et 12   **\n\n« De nouveau aussi, il lui envoya un autre capitaine de cinquante avec ses cinquante. Et il répondit et lui dit   Ô homme de Dieu, ainsi a dit le roi   Descends vite.\n\nEt Élie répondit et leur dit   Si je suis un homme de Dieu, que le feu descende du ciel et te dévore, toi et tes cinquante. Et le feu de Dieu descendit du ciel et le dévora lui et ses cinquante.  **\n\nLe roi a continué à envoyer des gens parce qu'il n'était pas le seul à mourir. Il envoya le troisième capitaine et ses cinquante. Le troisième capitaine était comme moi, ou plutôt je suis comme lui. Il est venu avec humilité, rien dont il puisse être fier dans cette vie. Pas l'uniforme qu'il portait ni les pouvoirs sur lui comme celui que le roi avait envoyé. Il est venu avec un esprit différent, ayant appris du groupe 1 et du groupe 2, qui ont tous deux péri. Il a adopté une approche différente et humble.  **\n\n Deuxième Rois 1 verset 13 à 15    **\n\n« Et il envoya de nouveau un capitaine du troisième cinquante avec ses cinquante. Et le troisième capitaine des cinquante monta, et vint et tomba à genoux devant Elie, et le pria, et lui dit   Ô homme de Dieu, je te prie, laisse ma vie et la vie de ces cinquante tes serviteurs, sois précieux à tes yeux.\n\nVoici, un feu est descendu du ciel et a brûlé les deux capitaines des anciens cinquantenaires avec leurs cinquantenaires  c'est pourquoi que ma vie soit maintenant précieuse à tes yeux.\n\nEt l'ange de l'Eternel dit à Elie   Descends avec lui ; n'aie pas peur de lui. Et il se leva et descendit avec lui vers le roi. ”  **\n\n\nSoin\n\nJe transmets un esprit différent dans votre vie, l'esprit de prudence, l'esprit d'humilité. Je mets un esprit contrit dans votre cœur; le Seigneur n'ignorera pas les contrits.\n\nEsaïe 57 verset 15   **\n\n« Car ainsi parle le haut et le haut qui habite l'éternité, dont le nom est Saint ; J'habite dans le haut et saint lieu, avec celui aussi qui est d'un esprit contrit et humble, pour raviver l'esprit des humbles et raviver le cœur des contrits.  **\n\nRecevez l'humilité dans votre vie ! C'est l'esprit de la victoire ; c'est l'esprit qui vous emmènera au ciel. Nous avons besoin de cet esprit parce que l'église a rétrogradé autour de nous. De nombreuses églises de la sainteté qui se vantaient de leur sainteté servent maintenant Satan ; ils ont échoué. Nous devons opérer dans un esprit différent. Je dis toujours, Seigneur, sauve nos vies. Quelle que soit la sagesse du diable, quelle que soit la puissance du diable, moi le capitaine des cinquante et mes cinquante, je ne mourrai jamais. Nous le ferons dans l'enlèvement. Il n'y aura pas de corruption, pas de décadence dans ce Mouvement de Sainteté jusqu'à ce que nous te voyions, Seigneur. Avec un esprit brisé, avec un esprit contrit, avec humilité et en pleine obéissance, nous te servirons Seigneur. Satan nous a perdus pour toujours ! Amen.  **\n\nApocalypse 12 verset 12    **\n\n« C'est pourquoi réjouissez-vous, cieux et vous qui y habitez. Malheur aux habitants de la terre et de la mer ! car le diable est descendu vers vous, animé d'une grande colère, parce qu'il sait qu'il n'a que peu de temps.  **\n\nSi vous voyez les yeux de Satan maintenant, ils sont rouge vif contre le Mouvement de la Sainteté ; il brûle au-dessus des dirigeants et contre vous qui avez été d'accord avec et avez accepté le message de la sainteté. Satan se vante   Ah, qui es-tu ? J'ai renversé de nombreux ministres; J'ai renversé et blessé de grandes églises. Je les ai mis dans leur coin, qui es-tu ? Le Seigneur répondra au diable; Il nous décrira au diable. Il est en nous. Au nom de Jésus, le diable tombera.    **\n\nMa confiance est la suivante   Abraham est arrivé au ciel, Sara est arrivée au ciel, Joseph est arrivé au ciel, Moïse est arrivé au ciel, Paul est arrivé au ciel, Pierre est arrivé au ciel, Marie est arrivée au ciel, Timothée est arrivé au ciel, nous aussi nous y arriverons, Dieu vous y conduira ! Si le diable les avait tous empêchés de faire le ciel, alors nous n'aurions aucun espoir. Si c'est juste que les êtres humains le manquent à cause de l'orgueil, de l'insouciance et du travail de la chair, nous dirons comme le moineau   « Si le diable chasseur est tirer sans manquer, nous volerons haut sans nous percher. Il ne nous aura jamais. Faire sûr que Satan ne vous aura jamais. Sœur, tenez-vous bien dans le Mouvement de la Sainteté ; Dieu vous portera sur ses ailes et vous fera voler au ciel. Dieu vous aidera à y entrer. La vie sainte est un mystère pour Satan. Avant qu'il comprenne quoi, nous aurons quitté la terre pour le ciel. Louez le Seigneur !  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE NEUF   **\n\nLE PLAN DIVIN POUR SURMONTER LES DÉFIS DE SATAN À LA FIN DES TEMPS   **\nJérémie 29 verset 11   **\n\n\"Car je connais les pensées que j'ai à votre égard, dit l'Éternel, des pensées de paix et non de mal, pour vous donner une fin attendue.\"  **\n\n\nEsdras 10 verset 2    **\n \n«Et Shekania , fils de Jehiel , l'un des fils d'Elam, répondit et dit à Esdras  Nous avons péché contre notre Dieu, et avons pris des femmes étrangères au peuple du pays. .”  **\n\nPar diverses activités, Satan endurcit le cœur des hommes et renverse les églises. Ces défis sont très présents. C'est\n\nEsaïe 43 verset 19 à 21   **\n\n« Voici , je vais faire une chose nouvelle ; maintenant il va jaillir; ne le saurez-vous pas ? Je ferai même un chemin dans le désert, et des fleuves dans le désert.\n\nLes bêtes des champs m'honoreront , les dragons et les hiboux, parce que je donne des eaux dans le désert, et des fleuves dans le désert, pour abreuver mon peuple, mon élu.\nJe me suis formé ce peuple ; ils proclameront ma louange.  **\n\n\nDu côté de Dieu, la lumière brille et cette lumière vous couvrira et vous conduira au ciel.  **\n\nPsaumes 23 versets 1 à 6    **\n\n\"Le Seigneur est mon berger; je ne voudrai pas.\n\n\nIl me fait reposer dans de verts pâturages Il me conduit près des eaux calmes.\n\n\nIl restaure mon âme   Il me conduit dans les sentiers de la justice à cause de son nom.\n\nOui, même si je marche dans la vallée de l'ombre de la mort, je ne crains aucun mal   car tu es avec moi ; Ta verge et ton bâton me réconfortent.\n\nTu dresses une table devant moi en présence de mes ennemis   Tu oins ma tête d'huile ; ma coupe déborde .\n\nLa bonté et la miséricorde m'accompagneront tous les jours de ma vie et j'habiterai à jamais dans la maison de l'Éternel.  **\n\nDieu a des promesses pour la fin des temps. Malgré l'obscurité du côté gauche , il y a la luminosité du côté droit. Dieu a pris des dispositions adéquates pour la fin des temps. Il sauvera l'humanité du péché et de Satan. Il gardera les saints sur la terre jusqu'à ce qu'il vienne les chercher.  **\n\nJean 10 versets 27 à 29.  **\n\n« Mes brebis entendent ma voix, et je les connais, et elles me suivent  \n\nEt je leur donne la vie éternelle; et ils ne périront jamais, et personne ne les ravira de ma main.\n\nMon Père, qui M'a donné, est plus grand que tout ; et personne ne peut les ravir de la main de mon Père.  **\n\nDieu répandra Son esprit sur toute chair pour un plus grand ministère. Vous qui vous êtes consacrés à sa sainteté, vous serez bénis. Vous deviendrez un grand ministre de Jésus-Christ. Le Seigneur veut vous transformer et vous oindre. Il veut changer votre statut.  **\n\nJoël 2 versets 28 à 29    **\n\n« Et il arrivera après que je répandrai mon esprit sur toute chair ; et vos fils et vos filles prophétiseront, vos vieillards rêveront des songes, vos jeunes gens verront des visions;\n\nEt aussi sur les serviteurs et sur la servante le péché ces jours-là, je répandrai mon esprit.  **\n\n\n9.1 \tVous recevrez l'onction de l'Esprit pour Exploit   **\n\nLe Seigneur vous a choisi et Il va déverser le Saint-Esprit et une onction spéciale sur vous pour Son affectation de la fin des temps. Par conséquent, préparez-vous pour l'onction du Saint-Esprit. Il veut que vous prophétisiez. Vous prophétiserez; vous vous tiendrez sur les montagnes et prophétiserez; vous monterez sur les maisons et prophétiserez ; vous monterez dans les véhicules et prophétiserez. Par votre prophétie, il y aura le salut des temps de la fin et le réveil du monde au nom de Jésus. C'est ce que Dieu fera. Quant à cet évangile, il sera prêché dans le monde entier.  **\n\nL'un des coordonnateurs m'a fait part d'une révélation que Dieu lui a donnée. Il a dit que nous étions dans un véhicule avec Jésus faisant le tour du monde. Le Saint-Esprit était le conducteur. Alors que nous traversions l'Afrique, des foules de gens suivaient nous. Puis nous avons déménagé en Asie, des foules de gens nous ont suivis. Nous nous sommes tournés vers l'Amérique et vers l'Europe et même vers l'Australie. Il a dit quand il a vu la foule en Australie, le Seigneur a dit  «Je vais faire quelque chose de spécial sur ce continent.  **\n\nActes 14 verset 1    **\n\n\"Et il arriva à Iconium, qu'ils entrèrent tous deux ensemble dans la synagogue des Juifs, et parlèrent ainsi , qu'une grande multitude de Juifs et aussi de Grecs crurent\".  ** \n\n\nVous faites partie des personnes sur lesquelles l'onction vient, au nom de Jésus.  **\n\n\nMatthieu 24 verset 14    **\n\n« Et cet évangile du royaume sera prêché dans le monde entier pour servir de témoignage à toutes les nations ; et alors viendra la fin ».  **\n\nCertains d'entre vous pensent que lorsque l'Écriture dit,\n\n\"Cet évangile du royaume sera prêché dans le monde entier\", cela signifie que tout le monde se repentira dans le monde. Pas ainsi ; c'est pour leur témoigner, non leur conversion totale. Mais certains entendront et se repentiront. Alors la fin viendra.  **\n\n\nÉzéchiel 12 verset 26 à 28    **\n \n« La parole de l'Éternel vint encore à moi, disant  \n\nFils de l'homme, voici, les gens de la maison d'Israël disent  La vision qu'il a est pour plusieurs jours, et il prophétise des temps lointains.\n\n C'est pourquoi dis-leur   Ainsi parle le Seigneur, l'Éternel ; Aucune de mes paroles ne se prolongera plus, mais la parole que j'ai prononcée sera faite, dit le Seigneur, l'Éternel. ”  **\n\n\nSachez que le temps n'est plus long. Nous sommes aux jours du retour du Seigneur. Vous n'aurez peut-être pas la chance d'atteindre l'âge adulte avant la venue du Seigneur. Vous n'aurez peut-être pas le privilège d'être diplômé de l'école que vous êtes maintenant avant la venue du Seigneur. Vous n'aurez peut-être pas le privilège de vous marier avant l'enlèvement    **\n\n9.2.\tLa sagesse de Dieu pour vous sauver vous et le reste    **\n\nLe diable fait maintenant son pire, à la fois dans l'église et dans le monde. Le Dieu du ciel est le Dieu de la sagesse. Il a dit que les jours seront\nraccourci. Ne pensez pas que les activités sataniques domineront partout. Non! Il y aura une provision suffisante pour le peuple de Dieu. Le Seigneur travaillera contre Satan d'une manière telle qu'il n'aura pas accès à vous. Vous terminerez votre ministère et serez transporté au ciel. Les jours seront raccourcis. Une sœur a prié Dieu avec ferveur pour la conversion de sa mère ! « Dieu protège ma mère ! Dieu protège ma mère. Le Seigneur l'entendit et lui dit   « Je vais sauver ta mère ; mais quand je sauverai ta mère, elle ne vivra pas longtemps, elle mourra. Je vais la prendre immédiatement parce que si elle reste plus longtemps, le mal la dominera. C'est Dieu. Il a dit au sujet d'Israël sortant d'Égypte pour le mont Sinaï   « Si je menez ce peuple par un court chemin vers la terre promise, ils feront face à de nombreuses batailles, et beaucoup ne pourront pas tenir debout. Je les emmènerai par le chemin du désert, car je veux les conserver.  **\n\n\nMatthieu 24 verset 21    **\n\n« Car alors il y aura une grande tribulation, telle qu'il n'y en a pas eu depuis le commencement du monde jusqu'à ce temps, non, et qu'il n'y en aura jamais. Et sauf que ces jours devraient être raccourcis. Aucune chair ne devrait être sauvée, mais à cause des élus, ces jours seront abrégés.  **\n\nIl raccourcira les jours de tribulation d'Israël à trois ans et demi à cause de l'intensité de la souffrance, étant le Dieu de la sagesse, de la connaissance et de la compréhension. Il peut raccourcir la durée de vie d'un homme ou la durée de son séjour pour éviter la frustration de sa foi par le méchant. Dieu prendra la décision appropriée sur vous afin de frustrer le diable et vous accorder la vie éternelle. Coopérez avec lui dans une vie juste et sainte.    **\n\nJude 24 à 25    **\n\n« Maintenant à celui qui est capable de vous empêcher de tomber et de vous présenter irréprochable devant la présence de sa gloire avec une joie extrême,\n\n\nAu seul Dieu sage notre Sauveur , soient gloire et majesté, domination et puissance, maintenant et à jamais. Amen.\"  **\n\n\n9.3.\tLa bataille contre la vérité et la droiture   **\n\nEsaïe 30 versets 8 à 11     **\n\n« Maintenant va, écris-le devant eux sur un tableau, et note-le dans un livre, afin que ce soit pour les temps à venir, pour toujours et à jamais  \n\nQue c'est un peuple rebelle, des enfants menteurs, des enfants qui n'entendront pas la loi de l'Éternel  \n\n\nQui disent aux voyants   Ne voyez pas ; et aux prophètes, Ne nous prophétisez pas de bonnes choses, dites-nous des choses douces, prophétisez des tromperies.\n\n\nÉloignez-vous du chemin, détournez-vous du chemin, faites cesser le Saint d'Israël de devant nous »  **\n\nLes êtres humains entrent dans une alliance avec Satan. Le plan est d'engloutir la justice dans tous les coins de la terre. Ils veulent s'assurer que le système éducatif est entièrement remis à Satan de telle manière qu'aucun enfant juste ne passe à l'école sans être souillé. Ils veulent s'assurer que les hommes d'affaires et les fonctionnaires soient livrés à Satan de telle manière qu'aucun homme ou femme ne passe sans être souillé. Ils veulent s'assurer que le système hospitalier est tellement pollué que personne ne vient à l'hôpital et n'en ressort sans souillure. Ils travaillent toujours, se vantent et frappent leurs mains sur leur poitrine en disant   « La justice va bientôt disparaître de la terre ?    **\n\nIls ne connaissent pas le plan de Dieu. Au moment où ils pensent avoir terminé leur plan, nous ne serons plus sur la terre, l'église aura été enlevée. Dieu a dit que ces mauvais jours seront abrégés. Si ces jours n'étaient pas abrégés, la pression serait trop insupportable même pour ceux qui sont nés de nouveau, sanctifiés et saints.  **\n\n\n\nPsaume 125 verset 3    **\n\n« Car la verge des méchants ne reposera pas sur le sort des justes ; de peur que les justes n'étendent leurs mains vers l'iniquité\"  **\n\nL'homme de Dieu dit   Ne me laisse pas être pauvre Seigneur, de peur que je ne vole et ne blasphème ton nom.  **\n\nProverbes 30 versets 8 et 9    **\n\n« Enlève loin de moi la vanité et le mensonge ne me donne ni pauvreté ni richesse ; nourris-moi avec de la nourriture qui me convient;\n\nDe peur que je ne sois rassasié, et ne te renie, et ne dise   Qui est l'Éternel ? ou que je sois pauvre, que je vole et que je prononce en vain le nom de mon Dieu.  **\n\nLa situation peut devenir si terrible, mais le Seigneur dit   « Je vais abréger le temps. Le Seigneur donnera à certains saints la grâce de mourir avant que l'ennemi ne les souille. Mais le reste d'entre nous ira dans le ravissement ! Maintenant, il y a un plan. Pourquoi Dieu vous appelle-t-il dans le Mouvement de la Sainteté ? C'est parce qu'Il veut que vous soyez préservés et mis à des fins saintes.  **\n\n\n\n 2 Timothée 2 versets 19 à 21    **\n\n« Néanmoins, le fondement de Dieu demeure assuré, ayant ce sceau   Le Seigneur connaît ceux qui sont à lui. Et que quiconque proclame le nom de Christ s'éloigne de l'iniquité.\n\nMais dans une grande maison, il n'y a pas seulement des vases d'or et d'argent, mais aussi de bois et de terre ; et certains à honorer , et certains à déshonorer .\n\nSi donc un homme se purifie de ceux-ci, il sera un vase d' honneur , sanctifié et propre à l'usage du maître, et préparé à toute bonne œuvre.  **\n\nLe Seigneur veut que vous soyez parmi le reste qui devrait Le servir sans pollution en cette fin des temps. Dieu vous appelle comme Il a appelé Moïse.  **\nÉzéchiel 6 verset 8    **\n \n« Mais je laisserai un reste, afin que vous en ayez quelques-uns qui échapperont à l'épée parmi les nations, quand vous serez dispersés à travers les pays.  **\n\nMaintenant, Dieu a encore des gens à sauver parmi les pécheurs. Il s'agit notamment d'enfants, de jeunes, d'hommes et de femmes. Ce sont les gens qui soupirent maintenant pour être sauvés du péché et de Satan. Le Seigneur les a vus et veut les sauver. C'est pourquoi Il appelle des gens comme vous pour le réveil de la fin des temps.  **\n\nExode 3 versets 9 et 10    **\n\n\"Maintenant donc, voici, le cri des enfants d'Israël est venu jusqu'à moi, et j'ai aussi vu l'oppression dont les Égyptiens les oppriment.\n\nViens donc, et je t'enverrai vers Pharaon, afin que tu fasses sortir d'Égypte mon peuple, les enfants d'Israël.  **\n\n\nIl y a encore des églises qui peuvent être ravivées en écoutant la parole de Dieu. J'ai entendu parler d'une église; Je pense que c'est dans l'État d'Enugu au Nigeria.   **\n\nLe pasteur reçut avec joie cette parole de sainteté et de justice dans une de nos croisades. Il apporta le message à son église en se demandant   « Mon église se dispersera-t-elle si je prêche ce message ? « C'était sa peur. Mais le Seigneur a parlé, qui le retiendra ? Nous ne pouvons que dire les choses que nous avons entendues et vues. Il est allé à son église et a déclaré cette vérité. Quand il a prêché cette parole de justice et de sainteté, (peut-être qu'il faisait ce frisson), les membres de l'église se sont levés et ont dit  \"Pasteur, c'est ce que nous attendions; Nous sommes prêts! C'est ce dont nous avons besoin. Nous irons avec ! \" JE appris qu'environ douze de ces femmes sont venues à la Conférence de la Sainteté. Un reste sera sauvé ! C'est ce qui va se passer partout.  **\n\nLes gens qui aiment Dieu sont toujours dans les églises et dans le monde. C'est pourquoi Dieu vous élève. Il veut que vous fassiez une œuvre finale de salut parmi les hommes avant que l'enlèvement n'ait lieu. Il vous remplira d'onction et de puissance pour l'évangélisation et le gain d'âmes.  **\n\nJean 10 verset 16    **\n\n«Et j'ai d'autres brebis, qui ne sont pas de cette bergerie  je dois les amener aussi, et elles entendront ma voix; et il y aura un seul troupeau et un seul berger.  **\n\nLe Seigneur veut voir de vraies femmes chrétiennes qui sont toutes prêtes pour le réveil de la fin des temps . Êtes-vous l'une d'entre elles, ma sœur? S'il te plaît, offre-toi à Dieu pour faire de toi l'un d'eux    **\n \nEsaïe 6 verset 8    **\n\n« Et j'ai entendu la voix du Seigneur, disant   Qui enverrai-je, et qui ira pour nous ? Alors je dis   Me voici ; envoie-moi.\"  **\n\nLaissez tout le monde vous voir comme une femme qui s'est engagée à apporter le réveil de la fin des temps. Mobilisez d'autres femmes chrétiennes à cette fin pour assurer le renouveau de la vérité, de la justice et de la sainteté. Mobilisez les femmes qui se sont liées pour le réveil de la fin des temps dans l'église, dans chaque communauté et institution. Que le Seigneur pose sa main sur vous; que le Seigneur déverse son Esprit sur vous. Nous avons besoin d'un réveil, d'un réveil de la fin des temps. Les âmes doivent être sauvées d'entrer dans le feu de l'enfer. L'église doit s'élever à la vérité de Christ et être restaurée à sa justice et sa sainteté. Satan doit être lié, et le reste doit être sauvé et préservé dans le Seigneur pour l'enlèvement.     **\n\n9.4 \tDieu demande des prières   **\n\nPour que cela se produise, Dieu vous appelle à prier.  **\n \nEsaïe 62 versets 1 à 7    **\n\n« A cause de Sion, je ne me tairai pas, et à cause de Jérusalem, je ne me reposerai pas, jusqu'à ce que sa justice sorte comme un éclat, et son salut comme une lampe qui s'allume .\n\nEt les Gentils verront ta justice, et tous les rois ta gloire, et tu seras appelé d'un nom nouveau, que la bouche de l'Éternel nommera.\n\nTu seras aussi une couronne de gloire dans la main de l'Éternel, et un diadème royal dans la main de ton Dieu.\n\nTu ne seras plus appelé Abandonné ; et ton pays ne sera plus appelé Désolation ; mais tu t'appelleras Hephzibah, et ton pays Beulah; car l'Éternel prend plaisir en toi, et ton pays sera marié.\n\n\nCar comme un jeune homme épouse une vierge, tes fils t'épouseront, et comme l'époux se réjouit de la mariée, ainsi ton Dieu se réjouira de toi.\n\nJ'ai placé des sentinelles sur tes murs, ô Jérusalem, qui ne se tiendront jamais en paix ni jour ni nuit, vous qui faites mention de l'Éternel, ne gardez pas le silence,\n\nEt ne lui donnez pas de repos jusqu'à ce qu'il soit établi et qu'il fasse de Jérusalem une louange sur la terre.  **\n\n\nLe Seigneur veut faire une chose spéciale sur la terre. Il veut faire un travail spécial dans l'église. C'est la moisson de la fin des temps, le réveil final en préparation de l'enlèvement. C'est pourquoi Il veut des prières. Il vous a appelé à prier afin qu'Il accomplisse une œuvre spéciale de réveil. Dans de nombreux cas, Dieu se limite aux prières.  **\n\n\nJérémie 29 versets 11 et 12    **\n\n« Car je connais les pensées que j'ai à votre égard, dit l'Éternel, des pensées de paix et non de mal, pour vous donner une fin attendue.\n\n\nAlors vous m'invoquerez, et vous irez me prier, et je vous exaucerai.  **\n\nIl dit   « Priez et je vous entendrai. je sais ce que je voulez faire mais vous priez. Je sais quoi faire pour ces gens, mais priez. Je sais comment entrer dans cette nation, mais vous priez. Je sais comment entrer dans cette tribu et y apporter Mon salut, mais vous priez. Je sais comment entrer dans cette église et apporter la transformation et abattre les murs des ténèbres dans cette église, mais vous priez. Le Seigneur vous appelle à la prière. Le Seigneur sait quoi faire dans cette religion. « Je sais comment briser l'épine dorsale de la religion islamique, mais je veux que vous priiez. Je vais t'entendre. Invoquez-Moi et Je vous répondrai. je ferai des merveilles; Je ferai de grandes choses, des choses merveilleuses à tes yeux ! Alors le Le Seigneur appelle des guerriers de prière qui prieront dans le réveil final. C'est pourquoi Il vous a choisi. C'est votre appel et vous recevez l'onction pour cela. Que le Seigneur mette l'esprit de prière dans votre vie au nom de Jésus; la prière qui apportera le réveil en Amérique, en Europe, en Afrique et fera briller la lumière de Dieu en Asie.  **\n\n\n9.5 \tLève-toi comme aux jours de Deborah   **\n\nDieu appelle ses filles à se lever comme aux jours de Deborah. Les hommes ont peur ; les hommes sont loin des églises ; les hommes dorment; c'est pourquoi Dieu appelle les femmes à se manifester. Votre Créateur vous voit avec dignité. Votre Dieu vous reconnaît. Vous ne voyez pas les hommes dans les églises; vous ne les voyez plus zélés pour Dieu. Puisque les hommes sont endormis et ont donné la chance au diable, le Seigneur dit maintenant   « Où sont mes filles ? Comme au temps de Deborah, tu te lèveras et tu feras de grandes choses au nom de Jésus. Deborah a chanté une chanson parce qu'à son époque, les hommes avaient peur; à son époque, les hommes étaient absents; à son époque, les hommes dormaient.  *\n\n\nJuges 5 versets 1 et 2    **\n\n« Alors Deborah et Barak, fils d' Abinoam , chantèrent ce jour-là   Louez l'Éternel pour la vengeance d'Israël, quand le peuple s'est volontairement offert.  **\n\nIl est temps que vous vous leviez, car les hommes ont vendu l'église à Satan. Ils ont opté pour la magie ; ils sont allés chercher de l'argent; ils sont partis pour d'autres choses. Ils corrompent l'église; ils font alliance avec Satan et envoient des gens en enfer. Dieu dit, tu devrais te lever, Deborah. Éveillé! Éveillé!! Éveillé!!! Laissez l'esprit de Deborah venir sur vous. Le Seigneur déverse l'esprit de Deborah sur les femmes des derniers jours. Vous serez un grand prédicateur; vous serez un grand enseignant de l'évangile; vous serez un grand guerrier. Je dis que tu récupéreras l'église, femme ! Vous apporterez le réveil au monde. C'est pourquoi le Seigneur vous appelle.  **\n\n9.6 \tLes vrais hommes sont peu nombreux   **\n\n\nMatthieu 9 verset 35 à 38    **\n\n«Et Jésus allait par toutes les villes et tous les villages, enseignant dans leurs synagogues, et prêchant l'évangile du royaume, et guérissant toute infirmité et toute infirmité parmi le peuple.\n\nMais quand il a vu les multitudes, il a été ému de compassion pour eux, parce qu'ils se sont évanouis et ont été dispersés au loin, comme des brebis sans berger.\n\nAlors il dit à ses disciples   La moisson est vraiment abondante, mais les ouvriers sont peu nombreux ;\n\nPriez donc le maître de la moisson, qu'il envoie des ouvriers dans sa moisson.  **\n\nLes quelques hommes qui sont là ne suffisent pas pour la grande moisson. Le fardeau est trop lourd pour eux. Les Moïse qui dirigent l'œuvre se plaignent maintenant   « Puis-je faire toutes ces choses ? seul?\" Les quelques hommes qui sont là soupirent pour de l'aide puisque leurs semblables ne sont pas là; leurs semblables sont allés après Satan. Ils ont conclu un contrat avec Satan. Les hommes disent comme Moïse. \"Oh Seigneur ai-je donné naissance à tous ces gens ? Pourquoi as-tu mis ce lourd fardeau sur moi seul ? « Les hommes ne sont pas là, mais les femmes sont là !  **\n\nFemme, es-tu là ? Le Seigneur s'est tourné vers vous, pour aider à porter le fardeau avec le peu d'hommes disponibles. Le renouveau doit venir ! Oui, c'est ce que dit le Seigneur; c'est ce que Dieu fait en ce temps de la fin. Réveille-toi, Deborah de notre génération; réveille-toi, fille du Seigneur; réveillez-vous, mères et sœurs dans l'église. Levez-vous et jouez votre rôle car le jeu est sur vous maintenant. Nous te surveillons; les anges vous regardent aussi. Le diable qui te méprisait te craindra. Le diable qui a dit   « Qui es-tu ? Vous n'êtes qu'une femme ordinaire », doit s'enfuir. Vous ferez des exploits pour Jésus. C'est ce que l'Éternel veut de vous.  **\nAllez, récupérez les âmes des hommes et des femmes ; allez, récupérez la vérité ; allez, recouvrez la justice; allez, retrouvez la sainteté en vue de la venue de Jésus.\n\nCela comporte des risques, mais vous êtes notre Esther. Nos yeux sont sur toi, Esther. Prendre le risque. Même au prix de votre vie. Prenez le risque, ces personnes doivent être délivrées ; le diable doit être renversé ! Haman et tout son peuple doivent être anéantis. De nombreux habitants du pays doivent devenir chrétiens. Les gens de votre communauté deviendront chrétiens. Je dis, prenez le risque. Êtes-vous prêt à prendre le risque ? Alors le Seigneur sera avec vous; tu couperas la tête de Goliath. Pharaon s'inclinera devant toi. Lève-toi sur tes pieds, le Seigneur a posé sa main sur toi.  **\n\nActe 26 versets 15 à 19    ** \n\n« Et j'ai dit   Qui es-tu, Seigneur ? Et il dit   Je suis Jésus que tu persécutes .\n\nMais lève-toi et tiens-toi sur tes pieds, car je t'ai apparu dans ce but, pour faire de toi un ministre et un témoin à la fois de ces choses que tu as vues, et de celles dans lesquelles je t'apparaîtrai;\n\nTe délivrant du peuple et des Gentils vers lesquels je t'envoie maintenant,\n\n\nPour ouvrir leurs yeux et les faire passer des ténèbres à la lumière et de la puissance de Satan à Dieu, afin qu'ils reçoivent le pardon des péchés et l'héritage parmi ceux qui sont sanctifiés par la foi qui est en moi.\n\n\nSur quoi, ô roi Agrippa, je n'ai pas désobéi à la vision céleste »  **\n\nIl est maintenant temps que les femmes doivent se lancer dans ce travail. Vous devez aller pour le Seigneur. Vous êtes un vase d' honneur pour Dieu. Il t'a fait pour Lui et les jours de ton exploit sont venus. Ce sont les jours de votre performance, les jours de votre gloire. Il est temps maintenant de rendre gloire à votre Créateur. Les hommes ont peur, les hommes sont absents ; oui, les hommes dorment. Les quelques-uns qui sont là, le fardeau est trop lourd pour eux. Lève-toi et travaille, ouvre la bouche et dis   « Seigneur, me voici. Je travaillerai et apporterai un réveil avant que l'enlèvement ne vienne.  **\n\n1 Corinthiens 9 versets 16 à 17    **\n\n« Car même si je prêche l'évangile, je n'ai rien à me glorifier   car la nécessité m'en est imposée ; oui, malheur à moi si je ne prêche pas l'évangile !\n\nCar si je fais cela volontairement, j'ai une récompense ; mais si c'est contre ma volonté, une dispensation de l'évangile m'est confiée.  **\n\n\n9.7.\tMon intersession pour toi et les autres femmes    **\n\nJe veux intercéder pour vous devant le Seigneur. Levez simplement la main. J'intercède pour vous qui avez lu ce message du Seigneur aujourd'hui au nom de Jésus !\n\nPère tout-puissant, je te confie cette femme; elle est ta fille. Nous avons vu que le Seigneur Jésus est déjà en route. Nous savons que nous sommes la génération qui verra le Seigneur venir nous ramener à la maison dans l'enlèvement. Oh Seigneur, le monde repose immensément dans l'ignorance, l'église est rétrograde. Seigneur Dieu, quel défi ! Les activités sataniques remplissent partout. Les hommes sont loin de l'église, les hommes ont peur, les hommes dorment. Seigneur, les quelques personnes qui sont là disent que le travail est trop pour eux. Dieu se tourne vers vos femmes; Seigneur, tourne-toi vers les femmes ! Que la puissance du Seigneur vienne sur les femmes ; prenez-les en charge, au nom de Jésus ! Comme au temps de Deborah, quand les hommes avaient peur de marcher sur les grandes routes, à cause de leurs ennemis et ils se cachaient et suivaient les chemins de brousse jusqu'à ce que Deborah se lève. Je prie pour une onction spéciale pour Deborah qui est devant vous maintenant.  **\n\nÔ Seigneur, que Deborah en Christ reçoive l'onction. Que l'onction du Seigneur repose sur vous ; laissez la puissance de Dieu reposer sur vous; laissez la grâce de Dieu reposer sur vous. Laissez l'onction du Saint-Esprit reposer sur vous. Recevez, au nom de Jésus. Père Tout-Puissant, dans son coin, dans son église, dans sa dénomination, où qu'elle soit, un réveil surgira là. Oh Dieu, reçois cette Sœur au nom de Jésus ! Femme, reçois l'onction, reçois la grâce de Dieu. Laissez vos yeux s'ouvrir, laissez la compréhension vous être donnée. Recevez la sagesse de l'évangile; recevoir le pouvoir sur Satan et les démons. Recevez le pouvoir des signes et des prodiges, au nom de Jésus. Élevez votre voix et remerciez le Seigneur, élevez votre voix et adorez le Seigneur. Le Seigneur t'a inscrit et t'a compté dans le nombre ; le Seigneur a mis Son Esprit sur votre vie ! Merci Jésus.  **\n\n9.8 \tLes Promesses de Dieu pour Votre ministère   **\n\n\nJérémie 1 verset 4 à 12    **\n\n« Alors la parole de l'Éternel vint à moi, disant  \n\n5 Avant de te former dans le ventre , je te connaissais ; et avant que tu sois sorti du ventre de ma mère, je t'ai sanctifié, et je t'ai établi prophète des nations.\n\n6 Alors je dis   Ah , Seigneur Dieu ! voici, je ne puis parler, car je suis un enfant.\n\n7 Mais l'Éternel me dit   Ne dis pas que je suis un enfant ; car tu iras vers tous ceux que je t'enverrai, et tu diras tout ce que je te commanderai.\n\n8 N'aie pas peur de leurs faces, car je suis avec toi pour te délivrer, dit l'Éternel.\n\n9 Alors l'Éternel étendit sa main et toucha ma bouche. Et l'Éternel me dit  Voici, j'ai mis mes paroles dans ta bouche.\n\n\n10 Vois, je t'ai établi aujourd'hui sur les nations et sur les royaumes, pour extirper, et abattre, et détruire, et\nabattre, construire et planter.\n\n11 Et la parole de l'Éternel vint à moi, disant   Jérémie, que vois -tu ? Et j'ai dit, je vois une tige d'amandier.\n\n12 Alors l'Éternel me dit   Tu as bien vu, car je hâterai ma parole de l'accomplir.  **\n\n\nJuges 6 versets 12 à 14    **\n\n12 Et l'ange de l'Éternel lui apparut, et lui dit   L'Éternel est avec toi, homme vaillant et vaillant .\n\n13 Et Gédéon lui dit   Ô mon Seigneur, si l'Éternel est avec nous, pourquoi donc tout cela nous est-il arrivé ? et où sont tous ses miracles dont nos pères nous ont parlé, en disant   L'Éternel ne nous a-t-il pas fait monter d'Égypte ? mais maintenant l'Éternel nous a abandonnés, et nous a livrés entre les mains des Madianites.\n\n14 Et l'Éternel le regarda, et dit   Va avec cette force, et tu délivreras Israël de la main des Madianites, ne t'ai-je pas envoyé ?  **\n\n\nJosué 1 verset 1 à 9    **\n\n« Après la mort de Moïse, serviteur de l'Éternel, il arriva que l'Éternel parla à Josué, fils de Nun, ministre de Moïse, disant  \n\nMoïse Mon serviteur est mort ; maintenant donc, lève-toi, passe ce Jourdain, toi et tout ce peuple, vers le pays que je leur donne, même aux enfants d'Israël.\n\nTout lieu que foulera la plante de votre pied, je vous l'ai donné, comme je l'ai dit à Moïse.\nDepuis le désert et ce Liban jusqu'au grand fleuve, le fleuve Euphrate, tout le pays des Hitites , et jusqu'à la grande mer vers le coucher du soleil, sera votre côte.\n\nAucun homme ne pourra se tenir devant toi tous les jours de ta vie. Comme j'ai été avec Moïse, ainsi je serai avec toi, je ne te manquerai pas, ni ne t'abandonnerai.\n\nFortifie-toi et prends courage, car c'est à ce peuple que tu partageras en héritage le pays que j'ai juré à leurs pères de leur donner.\n\nSeulement, sois fort et très courageux, afin de veiller à faire selon toute la loi que Moïse, mon serviteur, t'a ordonnée   ne t'en détourne ni à droite ni à gauche, afin que tu prospères où que tu ailles .\n\nCe livre de la loi ne s'éloignera pas de ta bouche; mais tu y méditeras jour et nuit, afin de veiller à faire selon tout ce qui y est écrit; car alors tu réussiras ta voie, et alors tu auras un bon succès.\n\n\nNe t'ai-je pas commandé ? Soyez forts et d'un bon courage; ne crains pas et ne t'effraie pas, car l'Éternel, ton Dieu, est avec toi partout où tu vas .\n\nLorsque vous aurez terminé votre service sur terre, vous irez au ciel paisiblement, joyeusement, victorieusement, pour recevoir une grande récompense. Amen, ainsi en sera-t-il.  **\n\n\n2 Timothée 4 versets 6 à 8    **\n\n« Car je suis maintenant prêt à être offert, et le moment de mon départ est proche.\n\nj'ai combattu un bon combat, j'ai terminé ma course, j'ai gardé la foi;\n\nDésormais, il m'est réservé une couronne de justice, que le Seigneur, le juste juge, me donnera en ce jour-là, non seulement à moi, mais aussi à tous ceux qui aiment son apparition.\n\n\nPasteur Paul Rika\n",

Les points sont donnés de manière méditative pour provoquer la conviction et des actions justes contre le péché chez le croyant et ceux qui l'entourent.  **\nLe livre est une étude approfondie sur le péché mise de manière dévotionnelle pour une lecture méditative. Puisse Dieu utiliser ce livre pour vous purger complètement du péché, vous donner la victoire quotidienne sur le péché et vous remplir de passion pour gagner des âmes. Voici les courtes lignes de mots qui reçoivent leur pleine expression dans ce livre   Ne commettez pas de péché. Ne cachez pas le péché. N'encouragez pas le péché. Ne favorisez pas le péché. Ne confessez pas un demi-péché. Ne refusez pas de juger le péché. Le péché en vous ne doit pas avoir de repos tant qu'il n'est pas parti. Le péché en vous doit être exposé. Le péché en vous doit être rejeté. 8 Le péché en vous doit être apporté à Jésus. Le péché en vous doit être détruit. Le péché en vous doit être remplacé par la justice de Christ. Le péché doit être fermement combattu. Le péché chez les autres devrait attirer votre pitié. Le péché chez les autres devrait attirer votre prière. Le péché chez les autres devrait vous rapprocher d'eux. Le péché chez les autres devrait attirer un message d'évangélisation. Le péché chez les autres devrait attirer des méthodes de gain d'âme. Le péché chez les autres devrait vous faire dépenser pour le salut des pécheurs en général. Le péché chez les autres devrait vous faire ne pas craindre la persécution pour leur salut.  **\n\nPARTIE   **\nNAS   **\nQu'est-ce que le péché ?  **\nComment la Bible définit-elle le péché ?  **\nRomains 3 verset 23   **\n23 Car tous ont péché et sont privés de la gloire de Dieu ;   **\nLe péché est ce qui fait qu'une personne est privée de la gloire de Dieu. Le péché ne rend pas gloire à Dieu dans votre vie. Cet aspect de votre vie ou de votre caractère qui ne glorifie pas Dieu est le péché. Le péché fait que Dieu désapprouve votre caractère ou votre attitude.  **\nPremier Jean 3 verset 4   **\n4 Quiconque commet un péché transgresse aussi la loi car le péché est la transgression de la loi.  **\nTransgresser la loi signifie enfreindre la loi de Dieu. Tu ne voleras pas, tu ne tueras pas, tu ne commettras pas d'adultère, etc. Si vous enfreignez l'un de ces commandements, vous êtes un pécheur. Si vous enfreignez la Parole comme spécifié par le Seigneur, vous transgressez, désobéissez, franchissez la ligne, et cela vous rend rebelle.\nVous devez faire le bien, être gentil, être patient et être humble. Lorsque vous affichez un caractère contraire à ceux-ci, vous avez enfreint la loi. Un exemple est donné aux maris et aux femmes.  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 22, 25   **\n22 Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme au Seigneur. 25 Maris, aimez vos femmes, comme Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle;  **\nLorsque vous vous rebellez contre ces commandements, vous avez péché. Lorsque vous manquez à ces instructions, vous avez péché.  **\nL'ORIGINE DU PECHE   **\nLe Seigneur a créé l'homme à son image pour jouir de sa présence pour l'éternité, lui donnant un seul commandement à garder.  **\nGenèse 2 verset 15 à 17   **\n15Et le Seigneur Dieu prit l'homme, et le plaça dans le jardin d'Eden pour le cultiver et le garder.\n16 Et le Seigneur Dieu commanda à l'homme, disant   De tout arbre du jardin tu pourras manger librement ;\n17 Mais de l'arbre de la connaissance du bien et du mal, tu n'en mangeras pas , car le jour où tu en mangeras , tu mourras sûrement.  **\nAprès avoir créé l'homme Adam, Dieu créa Eve, pour être sa compagne, les bénissant pour qu'ils soient féconds et se multiplient   **\n Genèse 1 verset 28   **\n28 Et Dieu les bénit, et Dieu leur dit   Soyez féconds, multipliez, et remplissez la terre, et soumettez-la, et dominez sur les poissons de la mer, et sur les oiseaux du ciel, et sur tout animal qui bouge sur la terre.  **\nSatan a été chassé du ciel à cause de la rébellion. Satan est apparu à Eve sous la forme d'un serpent, la trompant pour qu'elle désobéisse au commandement de Dieu     **\nGenèse 3 verset 1 à 5   **\n1 Or le serpent était plus rusé que n'importe quelle bête des champs que le Seigneur Dieu avait faite. Et il dit à la femme   Oui, Dieu a-t-il dit   Vous ne mangerez pas de tous les arbres du jardin ?\n2 Et la femme dit au serpent   Nous pouvons manger du fruit des arbres du jardin.\n3Mais du fruit de l'arbre qui est au milieu du jardin, Dieu a dit  Vous n'en mangerez pas, et vous n'y toucherez pas, de peur que vous ne mouriez. 4Et le serpent dit à la femme  Vous ne mourrez certainement pas.\n5 Car Dieu sait que le jour où vous en mangerez, vos yeux s'ouvriront, et vous serez comme des dieux, connaissant le bien et le mal.  **\nAprès avoir cédé à la tentation de Satan, Eve a convaincu Adam de faire de même.  **\nGenèse 3 verset 6   **\n6 Et quand la femme vit que l'arbre était bon à manger, et qu'il était agréable aux yeux, et qu'il s'agissait d'un arbre à désirer pour rendre sage, elle prit de son fruit, et en mangea, et lui donna aussi mari avec elle; et il a mangé.  **\nCe moment de désobéissance fut l'origine du péché dans le monde.  **\nLES CONSÉQUENCES DU PÉCHÉ   **\nLa conséquence du péché est la mort. Le Seigneur l'a clairement indiqué lorsqu'il a ordonné à Adam de ne pas manger de l'arbre du bien et du mal.  **\nGenèse 2 verset 17   **\n17 Mais de l'arbre de la connaissance du bien et du mal, tu n'en mangeras pas , car le jour où tu en mangeras , tu mourras certainement.  **\nParce que nous sommes tous des descendants d'Adam et Eve, nous sommes nés dans le péché et sommes naturellement disposés au péché.  **\nRomains 3 verset 23   **\n23 Car tous ont péché et sont privés de la gloire de Dieu ;   **\n Après la mort physique de tous les pécheurs, c'est la séparation éternelle d'avec Dieu en enfer, appelée la seconde mort   **\n2 Thessaloniciens 1 verset 8 à 9   **\n8 Dans un feu flamboyant se vengeant de ceux qui ne connaissent pas Dieu et qui n'obéissent pas à l'Evangile de notre Seigneur Jésus Christ .   **\nApocalypse 20 verset 15   **\nEt quiconque n'a pas été trouvé écrit dans le livre de vie a été jeté dans l'étang de feu.  **\nL'enfer est un endroit terrible. Dieu ne veut que personne y aille.  **\nDeuxième Pierre 3 verset 9   **\n9 Le Seigneur ne néglige pas sa promesse, comme certains pensent qu'il y a négligence ; mais il est patient envers nous, ne voulant pas qu'aucun périsse, mais que tous arrivent à la repentance.  **\nRomains 6 verset 23   **\n23 Car le salaire du péché, c'est la mort ; mais le don de Dieu, c'est la vie éternelle par Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur.  **\nPar Jésus-Christ, nous pouvons être sauvés. Ce livre est inspiré pour clarifier le péché et aider tous ceux qui sont sérieux à acquérir la compréhension nécessaire pour vaincre le péché dans leur vie. Voici les pensées inspirées sur le péché exprimées. Nous examinerons chacun de ces points plus en détail.  **\n\n\nLES PARTIES SUIVANTES TRAITENT DES CHOSES À NE PAS FAIRE AU SUJET DU PÉCHÉ   **\nDEUXIEME PARTIE   **\nNE COMMETTEZ PAS DE PÉCHÉ   **\nPremier Jean 3 verset 4   **\n4 Quiconque commet un péché transgresse aussi la loi car le péché est la transgression de la loi.  **\nNe péchez pas contre Dieu, contre la Parole de Dieu. Le péché enfreint la règle de Dieu. Le péché enfreint le commandement de Dieu, la loi de Dieu. Le péché signifie franchir la ligne que Dieu a tracée pour que vous ne la franchissiez pas. Ne péchez pas; sinon, vous briserez la règle de Dieu. Adam a péché en enfreignant la règle de Dieu qui lui ordonnait de ne pas manger de l'arbre de la connaissance du bien et du mal. N'enfreignez pas la règle de Dieu telle qu'elle nous est donnée concernant Le servir ou vivre ensemble dans la société, en relation comme un maître-serviteur, mari-femme, parentenfant .  **\n Premier Jean 3 verset 8 à 9   **\n8 Celui qui commet le péché est du diable; car le diable pèche dès le commencement. C'est dans ce but que le Fils de Dieu a été manifesté, afin de détruire les oeuvres du diable.\n9Quiconque est né de Dieu ne commet pas de péché; car sa semence demeure en lui, et il ne peut pécher, parce qu'il est né de Dieu.  **\nCelui qui pèche suit Satan et pratique ce que Satan a fait. Satan a enfreint la loi de Dieu en désobéissant à la Parole de Dieu dès le début. A cause du péché, Jésus est venu dans le monde pour détruire les oeuvres du diable. Il est venu à cause des activités de Satan. Par conséquent, n'entrez pas dans le péché pour vous associer à Satan. Restez à l'écart du péché. Soyez du côté de Jésus. Permettez à Jésus de détruire le péché dans votre vie, d'enlever le péché de vous. Soyez né de Dieu, et vous ne commettrez pas de péché. Naître de nouveau et ne pèche pas. Celui qui est né de nouveau ne pèche pas, parce que la Parole de Dieu est en lui, l'Esprit de Dieu est en lui, et par conséquent, il ne commet pas de péché.  **\nSi vous vous appliquez à fixer votre cœur sur la Parole de Dieu et à écouter la voix de l'Esprit en vous, vous ne pécherez pas, car la Parole de Dieu sanctifie l'homme et le libère du péché. L'Esprit de Dieu retire un homme du péché.\nLa Bible dit,  **\nPsaume 119 verset 11   **\n11 J'ai caché ta parole dans mon coeur, afin de ne pas pécher contre toi.  **\nPar conséquent, ne péchez pas. Le Saint-Esprit vous montrera ou vous convaincra de péché et vous aidera à ne pas pécher. Par conséquent, suivez la direction du Saint-Esprit dans votre cœur, ce qu'Il vous dit, ce qu'Il vous montre et la compréhension qu'Il vous donne afin que vous ne péchiez pas.  **\nJacques 2 verset 1, 9   **\n1 Mes frères, n'ayez pas la foi en notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ, le Seigneur de gloire, en ce qui concerne les personnes. 9 Mais si vous avez du respect pour les personnes, vous commettez le péché, et vous êtes convaincus de la loi comme transgresseurs.  **\nN'exaltez pas une personne au-dessus de Dieu. Ne craignez personne au-dessus de Dieu. Si vous craignez quelqu'un, peut-être à cause de sa position, en tant que leader, mari, épouse ou père, au-dessus de Dieu, vous péchez.\nNe commettez pas de péché signifie, n'en venez pas au point de craindre l'homme au-dessus de Dieu ; au point où vous craignez l'instruction de l'homme au-dessus de celle de Dieu. Que le nom d'un homme vous menace plus que le nom de Dieu est un péché. Faire quelque chose que la Parole de Dieu interdit par peur de l'homme est un péché parce que cela signifie que vous respectez l'homme au-dessus de Dieu. Ne commettez pas de péché à cause de qui que ce soit.  **\nNe violez pas la loi de Dieu.  **\nEzéchiel 18 verset 24   **\n24 Mais quand le juste se détourne de sa justice, et commet l'iniquité, et commet toutes les abominations que commet le méchant, vivra-t-il ? Toute sa justice qu'il a faite ne sera pas mentionnée; dans son offense qu'il a commise, et dans son péché qu'il a commis, il mourra en eux.  **\nSi vous êtes né de nouveau maintenant, vivez dans la justice et craignez Dieu, ne péchez pas. Si vous êtes venu à Christ, ne pratiquez pas l'immoralité, ne volez pas, ne combattez pas et ne mentez pas. Si vous le faites, Dieu oubliera votre justice. Si vous le faites et que vous y mourez, vous irez en enfer, et Dieu ne se souviendra pas de vos bonnes œuvres ou de votre service juste que vous avez rendu pour\nLui. Dieu ne s'en souviendra pas parce que vous êtes retourné au mal en commettant le péché.  **\n Ne commettez pas de péché.  **\nPourquoi votre justice devrait-elle être oubliée ? Pourquoi toutes les bonnes œuvres que vous avez faites devraient-elles être oubliées ? Pourquoi votre bon dossier devrait-il disparaître parce que vous êtes retourné au péché ? Ne faites pas cela.  **\nJean 8 verset 34   **\n34 Jésus leur répondit   En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, quiconque commet le péché est le serviteur du péché. 35 Et le serviteur ne demeure pas éternellement dans la maison, mais le Fils demeure toujours.  **\nLorsque vous commettez un péché, vous n'êtes plus le serviteur de Dieu mais le serviteur du péché. Êtes-vous un enfant de Dieu? Non! Vous êtes un enfant du péché, un serviteur du péché, parce que vous servez le péché. Le péché peut vous envoyer à la ville, et vous irez. Cela peut vous faire vous réveiller la nuit pour faire le mal et vous y consentirez. N'es-tu donc pas un serviteur du péché ? Tu es! Au lieu que Dieu soit le seul à dire   « Faites ceci » ou « Ne faites pas cela », le péché est devenu votre maître en vous disant quoi faire et quoi ne pas faire   le péché vous dit   N'allez pas à l'église, n'allez pas à l' église . priez, ne lisez pas votre Bible, faites du mal à celui-ci et à celui-là. Vous êtes un serviteur du péché !  **\nCelui qui commet le péché est un serviteur du péché.  **\nJean 1 verset 29   **\n29 Le lendemain, Jean vit Jésus venir à lui, et dit   Voici l'Agneau de Dieu, qui ôte le péché du monde.  **\nJésus a enlevé le péché du monde, donc le péché doit être enlevé de vous.  **\n\nPARTIE   **\nNE CACHEZ PAS LE PÉCHÉ   **\nDeutéronome 13 verset 6 à 11   **\n6 Si ton frère, le fils de ta mère, ou ton fils, ou ta fille, ou la femme de ton sein, ou ton ami, qui est comme ton âme, te séduisait en secret, en disant   Allons et servons d' autres dieux , que tu n'as pas connu, ni toi, ni tes pères;\n7 À savoir, des dieux des peuples qui sont autour de toi, proches de toi ou éloignés de toi, depuis une extrémité de la terre jusqu'à l'autre extrémité de la terre ;\n8 Tu ne lui consentiras pas, tu ne l'écouteras pas; ton œil n'aura pas pitié de lui, tu ne l'épargneras pas, tu ne le cacheras pas non plus   9 Mais tu le tueras sûrement ; ta main sera d'abord sur lui pour le faire mourir, et ensuite la main de tout le peuple.\n10 Et tu le lapideras avec des pierres, et il mourra ; parce qu'il a cherché à te repousser loin de l'Éternel, ton Dieu, qui t'a fait sortir du pays d'Égypte, de la maison de servitude. 11 Et tout Israël entendra, et aura peur, et ne fera plus aucune méchanceté comme celle-ci parmi vous.  **\nCacher, c'est cacher. Ne cachez pas le péché. Ne dissimulez pas le péché. Par exemple, vous rencontrez un frère ou une sœur dans l'église qui prétend être un enfant de Dieu mais qui mène une vie rétrograde. Ils viennent à vous secrètement, désirant le péché, chuchotant le péché, voulant peut-être coucher avec vous. La Bible dit que vous ne devriez pas épargner ou plaindre une telle personne. Au lieu de cela, ils devraient être exposés, disciplinés et châtiés par l'église.  **\nSi une personne mariée essaie de vous conduire à l'immoralité, elle ne devrait pas être couverte. Vous devez les révéler ou les signaler afin que l'affaire puisse faire l'objet d'une enquête et que juste devant vous, ils soient réprimandés, punis et jugés pour leur péché. Pourquoi leur permettre de vous induire en erreur alors que Jésus a tant travaillé pour votre salut ? Ne les cachez pas. Cela s'applique non seulement à l'immoralité, mais aussi à tous les autres péchés. Une fois que vous découvrez que la personne est injuste dans ses voies ou hypocrite, révélez son péché, peu importe son statut, afin que l'église soit purifiée   car un peu de levain fait lever toute la pâte .  **\nGalates 5 verset 9 à 10   **\n9 Un peu de levain fait lever toute la pâte.\n10 J'ai confiance en vous par le Seigneur, que vous ne voudriez pas être autrement, mais celui qui vous trouble portera son jugement, qui qu'il soit.  **\nSi vous cédez à son invitation à l'immoralité, il attirera beaucoup plus de gens, multipliant ainsi le péché dans l'Église. Obéissez à la Parole, pratiquez la Parole. La Bible dit que vos yeux n'auront pas pitié d'une telle personne.  **\nDeutéronome 13 verset 8   **\n8 Tu ne lui consentiras pas, tu ne l'écouteras pas; ton œil ne le plaindra pas, tu ne l'épargneras pas, tu ne le cacheras pas non plus    **\nEn d'autres termes, vous ne devez pas être d'accord avec lui, ni même l'écouter ou vous sentir désolé pour lui. Ne laissez pas une telle personne en liberté ou n'essayez pas de la protéger. Ne dites pas, par exemple   « Je connais le pasteur. Je connais Holiness Revival Movement   si je leur dis que j'ai vu ce pasteur dans un bar, ou que j'ai vu mon coordinateur dans une boîte de nuit, ils arrêteront son travail pastoral » Dans ce cas, vous le plaignez. Vous voulez que les hypocrites fassent l'œuvre de Dieu. Comment Dieu bénira-t-il le travail ? Si des hypocrites dirigent l'œuvre dans l'église, comment l'œuvre avancera-t-elle ? Cela signifie que vous n'avez pas un bon esprit pour Jésus et l'œuvre de son royaume. Ne savez-vous pas que le péché d'un seul homme est capable de contaminer toute l'assemblée ?  **\nJosué 7 verset 1, 11.  **\n1 Mais les enfants d'Israël ont commis une faute dans la chose maudite; car Acan , fils de Carmi, fils de Zabdi , prit de la chose maudite, et la colère de l'Éternel s'enflamma contre les enfants d'Israël,\n11 Israël a péché, et ils ont aussi transgressé mon alliance que je leur ai prescrite ; car ils ont même pris de la chose maudite, et l'ont aussi volée, et aussi dissimulée, et ils l'ont mise même parmi leurs propres affaires.  **\nC'est pourquoi le Seigneur vous tiendra responsable. Il vous a mis dans la position de découvrir le péché pour savoir à quel point vous êtes zélé pour Son nom, mais vous avez échoué. Votre péché apparaîtra devant vous en jugement. Le registre indiquera le jour où le Seigneur vous a révélé le péché de cet homme ou de cette femme, et vous les avez épargnés ; ça va se voir. Les archives ne montrent-elles pas quand Modecai a révélé le péché de ceux qui voulaient tuer le roi Assuérus ? N'était-ce pas enregistré ? Qu'en est-il du récit de Dieu, qui sait ce que chaque homme aurait dû faire mais n'a pas fait ?  **\nSi Modecai avait permis à ces deux personnes qui voulaient tuer le roi, la position d'Esther serait devenue inutile, et les Juifs n'auraient pas échappé au plan du diable. Tout ce qu'un homme sème, il le récoltera.\nLe mal que vous refusez de détruire attendra pour vous détruire. Le serpent que vous avez vu et que vous auriez dû tuer, mais que vous avez choisi de le laisser partir, se tiendra à l'affût pour vous mordre. C'est pourquoi la Bible nous dit de ne pas cacher le pécheur pour ne pas tomber dans le piège du péché ou être jugé par Dieu.  **\nPARTIE   **\nNE PAS ENCOURAGER LE PÉCHÉ   **\nRomains 14 verset 13   **\n13 Ne nous jugeons donc plus les uns les autres , mais jugeons plutôt ceci, que personne ne mette une pierre d'achoppement ou une occasion de tomber sur le chemin de son frère.  **\nMettre une pierre d'achoppement sur le chemin de votre frère, c'est encourager le péché. Pourquoi avez-vous jumelé cette femme et cet homme, les envoyant ensemble pour une mission, là où ils pourraient être seuls, alors qu'ils ne sont pas mari et femme ? Lorsque vous faites cela, vous encouragez le péché. Pourquoi payez-vous aux gens un salaire qui ne peut pas les nourrir ? Vous encouragez le vol. Il vaudrait mieux ne pas les employer que de leur verser un salaire qui les fera songer à voler ; parce que le salaire ne peut pas les soutenir.  **\nProverbes 30 verset 8 à 9   **\n8 Eloignez loin de moi la vanité et les mensonges ; ne me donne ni pauvreté ni richesse; nourris-moi avec de la nourriture qui me convient; 9 De peur que je ne sois rassasié, et que je ne te renie, et ne dise   Qui est l'Éternel ? ou que je sois pauvre, que je vole et que je prononce en vain le nom de mon Dieu.  **\nAlors n'encouragez pas le péché. Ne créez pas d'opportunités qui peuvent amener les gens à pécher. Ne placez pas une pierre d'achoppement qui fera pécher un autre. Par exemple, vous avez donné à quelqu'un de l'argent à garder pour vous, mais vous ne vérifiez pas si l'argent est toujours intact. Sachez que pour certaines personnes, cela peut présenter une opportunité de vol ! Le diable dira   « Utilise-le. Il n'en est pas bordé ? Utilise le.\" Mais si de temps en temps vous vérifiez pour demander, « Jusqu'où avec ça ? vous créez la peur dans son cœur. Ne donnez aucune occasion aux personnes qui travaillent avec vous de pécher.  **\n1 Corinthiens 8 verset 9   **\n9 Mais prenez garde que cette liberté qui est la vôtre ne devienne une pierre d'achoppement pour ceux qui sont faibles.  **\nEn tant que femme, même dans le confort de votre foyer, faites attention à la façon dont vous exposez votre nudité. Lorsque vous n'êtes pas le seul dans votre maison ou le seul à avoir accès à votre maison, lorsque vous avez des personnes à charge , des visiteurs et des voisins , vous devez être prudent et faire attention à la façon dont vous vous habillez. Vous avez la liberté et la liberté dans votre maison, de sortir nu ou presque nu de votre salle de bain, mais ne le faites pas en présence d'autrui, et ne laissez pas votre liberté faire tomber quelqu'un d'autre. En tant que pasteur, savez-vous que d'autres peuvent apprendre de vous ? En tant que pasteur, savez-vous que les autres vous regardent ? Savez-vous que ceux qui vous regardent sont conscients de vos retards habituels, et certains feront de même ? Vous avez la liberté et la liberté, mais ne laissez pas votre liberté et votre liberté faire tomber les autres.  **\nVous dites   « Je ne suis pas responsable », mais vous l'êtes ! Comment une femme peut-elle se promener nue en public et nier la responsabilité de l'excitation sexuelle et de la libération chez les hommes ? Que voulez-vous dire par \"Je ne suis pas responsable de la convoitise dans leurs cœurs?\" Vous êtes responsable car votre apparence envoie des signaux à ceux qui vous entourent ou à ceux que vous croisez. Vous serez jugée prostituée. Vous serez jugée une femme méchante. Vous pourriez dire   « Je n'ai jamais connu d'autre homme que mon mari. Mais tu as couché avec des hommes dans l'esprit à cause de ton habillement nu.  **\nMatthieu 5 verset 28   **\nMais je vous dis que quiconque regarde une femme pour la convoiter a déjà commis un adultère avec elle dans son cœur.  **\nC'est bien d'aimer les gens, mais vous devez faire attention à ne pas donner une mauvaise impression. Certaines femmes sont joueuses. Ils peuvent faire ou dire de manière ludique et par ignorance quelque chose qui peut amener certains hommes à développer des sentiments sexuels. Votre nature tendre et susceptible peut susciter des désirs chez les hommes. Ne clame pas ton innocence car Dieu te tiendra pour responsable. Ne devenez pas indécent avec un homme en parlant, en touchant ou en regardant. Maintenez des limites de sécurité dans vos relations avec le sexe opposé. Un homme peut-il mettre du feu dans son sein sans que ses vêtements soient brûlés ? Peut-on marcher sur des charbons ardents sans se brûler les pieds ? Une femme peut-elle s'approcher trop près d'un homme sans que son corps ne réponde ? Un homme peut-il faire la même chose à une femme, l'embrasser, lui frotter le dos, lui dire « je t'aime » et prétendre qu'il n'y a rien dans son cœur envers elle ? Le sentiment et les mots que vous dites peuvent rester avec la femme pendant de nombreuses années, et le diable peut les utiliser à tout moment pour diriger ses pensées vers vous. Tu dois faire attention!  **\nN'encouragez pas le péché, ne créez pas d'occasions pour le péché et ne placez pas dans votre liberté une pierre d'achoppement pour que les autres péchent.  **\nApocalypse 2 verset 14   **\n14 Mais j'ai quelques choses contre toi, parce que tu as là des tenants de la doctrine de Balaam, qui enseigna à Balac à jeter une pierre d'achoppement devant les enfants d'Israël, à manger des viandes sacrifiées aux idoles et à commettre la fornication.  **\nBalak a invité Balaam à maudire les enfants d'Israël en leur jetant des sorts. Balaam est venu et n'a pas pu le faire, car Dieu l'avait averti de ne pas jeter de mauvais sort sur eux parce que les enfants d'Israël étaient bénis. Balak avait promis beaucoup d'argent à Balaam s'il le faisait. Balaam comprenait les choses de Dieu. Il savait que Dieu ne tolérait pas l'iniquité. Il savait que Dieu punirait Israël s'il entrait dans le péché, alors il conseilla à Balak , le roi de Moab, de libérer ses femmes pour aller parmi les enfants d'Israël, pour socialiser avec elles afin que les enfants d'Israël soient tentés de commettre l'immoralité. avec eux. Ce faisant, ils briseraient la haie de protection de Dieu autour d'eux et deviendraient vulnérables à leurs ennemis. Il a appris à Balak à jeter une pierre d'achoppement sur le chemin des enfants de Dieu. Certains enseignent aux femmes comment se marier. Ils exhortent les femmes à flirter de différentes manières. Ils savent que leurs enseignements ne sont pas bibliques. Au lieu de leur apprendre à trouver un partenaire en priant ou en pratiquant une vie juste, ils leur apprennent à trouver un partenaire par des moyens charnels. Vous qui encouragez les faux rêves   en disant   « Qu'ils aillent lui dire qu'ils ont fait un rêve. Vous enseignez la malhonnêteté et les mensonges. Vous encouragez le péché parmi le peuple de Dieu ! Être averti!! Balak leur a appris à donner aux enfants d'Israël la nourriture des idoles à manger afin que la jalousie de Dieu soit éveillée ; de les inviter à des célébrations idolâtres afin qu'ils se souillent et que leur Dieu retire sa main d'eux. C'est ce que fait l'ennemi.  **\nEnfant de Dieu, prends garde aux ennemis qui veulent détruire les plans de Dieu sur ta vie. La Bible dit que nous devons veiller et prier pour ne pas être victimes des tentations que Satan nous réserve.  **\nMatthieu 26 verset 41   **\n41 Veillez et priez, afin que vous n'entriez pas en tentation, l'esprit est bien disposé, mais la chair est faible.  **\nVeillez à ce que les gens qui travaillent contre vous n'aient pas ce qu'ils veulent.  **\n\nCINQUIEME PARTIE   **\nNE FAITES PAS LA PROMOTION DU PÉCHÉ   **\nNe pas promouvoir le péché, signifie ne pas multiplier ou répandre le péché.  **\nJacques 5 verset 19 à 20   **\n19 Frères, si quelqu'un d'entre vous s'écarte de la vérité, et que quelqu'un le convertisse ; 20 Qu'il sache que celui qui convertit le pécheur de l'égarement de sa voie sauvera une âme de la mort et cachera une multitude de péchés.  **\nQuand il pleut sur le sol sec, l'herbe pousse. Plus il pleut, plus les herbes poussent. De même, le péché grandit à partir du moment où il est conçu. Pour cette raison, vous ne devriez pas le divertir du tout. Que le péché ne soit pas nommé parmi vous. Ne lui permettez pas de commencer; vous risquez d'en perdre le contrôle.\nPar exemple, vous voyez un homme que vous connaissez pécher. Au lieu de le confronter pour l'aider à arrêter son péché, tu te tais et tu ne t'en soucies pas. Si l'on n'y prend garde, cet homme seul peut entraîner beaucoup d'autres dans ce péché, multipliant ainsi les pécheurs autour de lui et dans la société. Maintenant, un péché est devenu dix. Un pécheur a contaminé dix personnes, et dix personnes sont prêtes à en contaminer d'autres. Il peut progresser géométriquement jusqu'à cent ou deux cents ou même mille.\nAlors, si vous voyez un croyant vaincu par quelque péché, aidez-le doucement et rapidement à revenir dans le droit chemin. La Bible dit qu'en agissant ainsi, vous avez sauvé une âme de l'enfer et couvert une multitude de péchés. Vous avez freiné la propagation du péché. Alors, ne multipliez pas ou ne favorisez pas le péché en étant indifférent ou en refusant délibérément d'agir en conséquence lorsque vous voyez un frère vaincu par celui-ci.  **\nLévitique 19 verset 16   **\n16 Tu n'iras pas comme un conteur parmi ton peuple; tu ne résisteras pas non plus au sang de ton prochain ; Je suis le Seigneur.  **\nLes conteurs promeuvent le péché. Ils viennent avec des demi-vérités ou des mensonges. Les porteurs de contes transportent des histoires d'un endroit à l'autre, ajoutant et modifiant les détails au fur et à mesure qu'ils se déplacent. Ils ne peuvent pas se reposer tant qu'ils n'ont pas répandu tout ce qu'ils pensent. Tous ceux qui aiment partager des histoires, rapportant la moindre petite chose qu'ils entendent, causent le mal, multiplient le péché et apportent le déshonneur ou le reproche à la communauté en répandant l'iniquité. Certaines de ces histoires ne sont pas vraies ou sont à moitié vraies. N'est-ce pas un péché de demander aux gens d'utiliser les mensonges ou la demi-vérité que vous partagez ?\nDieu vous a-t-il amené dans ce monde pour répandre des rumeurs ? Un enfant de Dieu ne devrait jamais amener les gens à se battre, à se disputer, à murmurer ou à se disputer à cause des informations qu'ils diffusent. Ne répandez pas le péché. Les conteurs encouragent le péché parce qu'ils contaminent les gens avec leur langue. La langue peut conduire beaucoup de gens au péché. Alors, apprenez à tenir votre langue.  **\nJacques 1 verset 26   **\n26 Si quelqu'un parmi vous semble être religieux et ne bride pas sa langue mais trompe son propre cœur, la religion de cet homme est vaine.  **\nSi vous vomissez tout ce que vous mangez, pouvez-vous être fort dans votre corps ? Cela ne montre-t-il pas que vous êtes malade ? De même, lorsque vous partagez des informations, vous ne devriez pas, cela montre que vous êtes spirituellement malade.\nIl y a une histoire de trois pasteurs qui se sont rencontrés pour discuter des défis de leurs ministères. Le premier a avoué avoir convoité les femmes. Le second a avoué la cupidité et le vol de l'argent de l'église. Enfin, le troisième a avoué avoir bavardé, incapable de retenir la moindre information qui lui parvenait. Il dit   « Je ne peux pas garder pour moi ce que vous avez dit tous les deux ; peu importe mes efforts, je dois dire aux autres ce que vous avez dit, c'est très triste. Ne favorisez pas le péché. Ne diffusez pas d'informations mauvaises ou secrètes. L'information doit aller là où elle doit aller, et sous la direction du Saint-Esprit. Assurez-vous d'avoir bien entendu et vérifié les faits, puis, avec amour, partagez avec les personnes concernées.  **\n\nPARTIE   **\nNE PAS CONFESSER UN DEMI-PÉCHÉ   **\nGenèse 20 verset 12   **\nEt pourtant c'est bien ma sœur ; elle est la fille de mon père, mais pas la fille de ma mère ; et elle est devenue ma femme.  **\nAbraham a avoué ce qui était juste seulement après que le roi Abimélek l'ait réprimandé pour avoir menti au sujet de sa femme, Sarah.\nNe confessez pas un demi-péché. Si vous péchez et avez besoin de réparation, n'ayez pas honte de confesser pleinement le péché. Cela montrera que vous êtes sincèrement désolé et prêt à changer.  **\nPremiers Rois 11 verset 4   **\n4Car il arriva, lorsque Salomon fut vieux, que ses femmes détournèrent son coeur vers d'autres dieux, et son coeur n'était pas parfait avec l'Eternel son Dieu, comme l'était le coeur de David, son père.  **\nLe cœur de Salomon n'était pas parfait devant l'Éternel, son Dieu, comme l'était le cœur de David, parce qu'il avait rétrogradé par ses femmes. Parce qu'il a été induit en erreur par ses nombreuses épouses, il ne pouvait pas être entièrement dévoué à Dieu. Vous devez être entièrement soumis à Dieu pour surmonter toute peur du mal, de l'emprisonnement, de la mort, de la punition, du ridicule ou de la perte.\nAvant de faire restitution, vous devez prier pour que Dieu vous aide à pouvoir vous ouvrir pleinement. Par exemple, pour faire une restitution pour un avortement, ne mentez pas que c'est un médicament que vous avez pris pour un mal de ventre qui a mis fin à la grossesse. Dites la vérité que vous saviez que vous étiez enceinte et que vous connaissiez l'effet des médicaments que vous receviez de la pharmacie. Ne confessez pas un demi-péché. Sinon, comment Dieu vous pardonnera-t-il ? Il désire celui qui dira la vérité dans son cœur. Dieu veut que vous disiez la vérité avec votre cœur et que vous soyez disponible pour le jugement. Ensuite, Il dira que le Jugement a été enlevé en Christ. C'est comme Il le voit.  **\nSi vous allez au marché demander cinq mesures, accepterez-vous de prendre quatre mesures à la place ? Vous demanderez les cinq mesures que vous avez payées. Pensez-vous que c'est Dieu qui acceptera une confession partielle ?\nLa sagesse est là pour diriger. La sagesse est profitable à diriger, mais la sagesse doit être dans la justice. C'est de la sagesse quand on sait quoi dire et quand le dire. Prenez Samuel, par exemple. Lorsqu'il eut peur d'aller oindre David comme Dieu l'avait commandé, Dieu lui conseilla de ne pas dire aux anciens sa mission principale mais de leur dire simplement qu'il était venu sacrifier au Seigneur ; Jesse et ses fils ont été invités. C'était la sagesse, et c'est ainsi que David a été paisiblement oint le prochain roi d'Israël à l'insu de Saül, le roi régnant.  **\nPremier Samuel 16 verset 1 à 13   **\n1 Et l'Éternel dit à Samuel   Jusqu'à quand pleureras-tu Saül, puisque je l'ai rejeté pour qu'il ne règne pas sur Israël ? remplis ta corne d'huile, et va, je t'enverrai vers Jessé le Bethlémite, car je m'ai donné un roi parmi ses fils.\n2 Et Samuel dit   Comment puis-je y aller ? si Saül l'entend, il me tuera. Et l'Éternel dit   Prends une génisse avec toi, et dis   Je suis venu sacrifier à l'Éternel.\n3 Et appelle Isaï au sacrifice, et je te montrerai ce que tu dois faire, et tu oindras pour moi celui que je te nommerai. 4Et Samuel fit ce que l'Eternel avait dit , et vint à Bethlehem. Et les anciens de la ville tremblèrent à son arrivée, et dirent   Viens -tu en paix ?\n5 Et il dit   En paix   je suis venu sacrifier à l'Éternel ; sanctifiez-vous et venez avec moi au sacrifice. Et il sanctifia Isaï et ses fils, et les appela au sacrifice. 6Et il arriva, comme ils etaient arrives, qu'il regarda Eliab, et dit  Certes, l'oint de l'Eternel est devant lui.\n7 Mais le Seigneur dit à Samuel   Ne regarde pas son visage, ni la hauteur de sa stature ; parce que je l'ai refusé   car le Seigneur ne voit pas comme l'homme voit ; car l'homme regarde à l'apparence extérieure, mais le Seigneur regarde au cœur.\n8 Alors Isaï appela Abinadab et le fit passer devant Samuel. Et il dit  Le Seigneur n'a pas non plus choisi cela. 9Alors Isaï fit passer Shamma. Et il dit  Le Seigneur n'a pas non plus choisi cela.\n10 De nouveau, Isaï fit passer sept de ses fils devant Samuel. Et Samuel dit à Isaï   L'Éternel n'a pas choisi ceux-ci.\n11 Et Samuel dit à Isaï   Y a-t-il ici tous tes enfants ? Et il dit   Là reste encore le plus jeune, et voici, il garde les brebis. Et Samuel dit à Isaï   Envoie le chercher ; car nous ne nous assiérons pas jusqu'à ce qu'il soit venu ici.\n12 Et il l'envoya, et le fit entrer. Or il était vermeil, et en plus d'un beau visage, et beau à voir. Et le Seigneur dit   Lève-toi, oins-le ; car c'est lui.\n13 Alors Samuel prit la corne d'huile, et l'oignit au milieu de ses frères ; et l'Esprit de l'Éternel vint sur David à partir de ce jour-là. Alors Samuel se leva et alla à Rama.  **\n\nPARTIE   **\n\nNE REFUSEZ PAS DE JUGER SIN   **\n Exode 23 verset 6   **\n6 Tu n'arracheras pas le jugement de ton pauvre dans sa cause.  **\nLévitique 19 verset 15   **\n15 Vous ne ferez pas d'injustice dans le jugement; vous n'aurez pas égard à la personne du pauvre, ni honorer la personne du puissant; mais vous jugerez votre prochain avec justice .  **\nLes personnes âgées sont considérées comme ayant raison dans certaines cultures et ne doivent pas être jugées. Tout ce qu'ils disent ou font est supposé correct. C'est la culture, la tradition, et non la Parole de Dieu ; car tous ont péché et sont privés de la gloire de Dieu.  **\nRomains 3 verset 23   **\n23 Car tous ont péché et sont privés de la gloire de Dieu ;   **\nCela inclut les jeunes et les vieux. N'évitez pas de juger l'homme plus âgé ou de l'amener à la lumière des Écritures. Voulez-vous envoyer le vieil homme en enfer ?\nLe péché est toujours dans sa main, et vous refusez de le mettre à la lumière de l'Écriture. Les vieux ne volent-ils pas ou ne mentent-ils pas ? Cette tendance est courante dans les sociétés en développement où le leadership est hautement exalté. Les leaders sont traités comme des anges qui ne pèchent pas. Le « grand homme » est supérieur à la loi et ne reçoit pas de jugement. Lorsque le jugement de Dieu est dans le pays, les gens apprennent la justice.  **\n Esaïe 26 verset 9   **\n9 De mon âme je t'ai désiré dans la nuit; oui, avec mon esprit en moi, je te chercherai de bonne heure, car lorsque tes jugements seront sur la terre, les habitants du monde apprendront la justice.  **\nLes grands hommes sont ceux qui transportent des parties humaines dans leurs véhicules, et parce qu'ils sont les gouverneurs, les sénateurs, les agents des forces de l'ordre ne vérifient pas leurs voitures.\nNe refusez pas de juger le péché. C'est le principe de l'église. Certains diront   « Je ne peux pas siéger en jugement avec ce garçon. Si vous dites cela, vous n'êtes pas chrétien. Qu'est-ce qui fait de lui un garçon et de toi un homme ? Toutes les âmes sont à moi, l'âme qui pèche , c'est elle qui mourra.  **\nEzéchiel 18 verset 4   **\n4 Voici, toutes les âmes sont à moi ; comme l'âme du père, ainsi aussi l'âme du fils est à moi ; l'âme qui pèche , elle mourra.  **\nLe garçon ne devrait-il pas recevoir sa justice? Tu n'opprimeras pas un autre qui habite avec toi dans le pays.  **\nLévitique 25 verset 17   **\n17 Vous ne vous opprimerez donc pas les uns les autres ; mais tu craindras ton Dieu, car je suis l'Éternel, ton Dieu.  **\nPasteur, expliquez pourquoi une femme dit que vous l'avez maltraitée. Veuillez expliquer pourquoi le garçon dit que vous l'oppressez. Ne dites pas qu'en raison de votre position, vous ne pouvez pas vous humilier en présence de l'accusateur pour expliquer une accusation. C'est la voie d'un coupable, d'un pécheur.\nNe refusez pas de juger le péché. N'avoir aucun respect pour les personnes. Ceux que vous respectez et refusez de juger continuent de corrompre la justice et de multiplier l'iniquité dans le pays ou l'église.  **\nLévitique 19 verset 15   **\n15 Vous ne ferez aucune injustice dans le jugement, vous ne respecterez pas la personne du pauvre, ni n'honorerez la personne du puissant, mais vous jugerez votre prochain avec justice .  **\nNe dites pas   « Cet homme est trop pauvre ; Je ne pense pas qu'il puisse faire ceci ou qu'il ait les moyens de faire cela. Examinez-le puisque le rapport est arrivé sur lui. Chaque signalement doit faire l'objet d'une enquête sans excuse ni respect de personne. Ne pensez pas qu'une personne malade est trop malade pour commettre l'immoralité. Ne sous-estimez personne et examinez tout.\nJugez en justice. Sinon, l'opprimé peut vous reprocher de lui avoir refusé justice.  **\nDeutéronome 1 verset 12 à 18   **\n12 Comment puis-je porter moi seul ton poids, ton fardeau et tes querelles ? 13 Prenez parmi vos tribus des hommes sages, intelligents et connus, et je les établirai sur vous.\n14 Et vous m'avez répondu, et avez dit   La chose que tu as dite est bonne à faire pour nous. 15 J'ai donc pris les chefs de vos tribus, des hommes sages et connus, et je les ai établis chefs sur vous, chefs de milliers, chefs de centaines, chefs de cinquantaines, chefs de dizaines, et officiers parmi vos tribus.\n16 Et j'ai ordonné à vos juges en ce temps-là, disant   Écoutez les causes entre vos frères, et jugez avec justice entre chacun et son frère, et l'étranger qui est avec lui.\n17 Vous ne respecterez personne dans le jugement; mais vous entendrez les petits comme les grands ; vous n'aurez pas peur de la face de l'homme; car le jugement est de Dieu ; et la cause qui est trop dure pour vous, apportez-la-moi, et je l'entendrai.\n18 Et je vous ai commandé en ce temps-là toutes les choses que vous deviez faire.  **\nMoïse a chargé les juges et les fonctionnaires choisis par le peuple de prendre le temps d'écouter attentivement les affaires portées devant eux avant de prononcer un jugement. Comment, alors, jugez-vous sans entendre toute l'histoire ? Pourquoi condamnez-vous l'autre personne lorsque vous n'avez pas écouté sa version de l'histoire ?\nSi la personne dit un mensonge, l'Esprit de Dieu vous le montrera, comme Il l'a montré à Pierre concernant Ananias et Saphira.  **\nActes 5 verset 1 à 11   **\n1 Mais un homme nommé Ananias, avec Saphira, sa femme, vendit une propriété, 2 et garda une partie du prix, sa femme aussi en ayant connaissance, et apporta une certaine part, et la déposa aux pieds des apôtres.\n3 Mais Pierre dit   Ananias, pourquoi Satan a-t-il rempli ton cœur pour mentir au Saint-Esprit et retenir une partie du prix du terrain ?\n4 Tant qu'il est resté, n'était-il pas à toi ? et après qu'il a été vendu, n'était-ce pas en ton propre pouvoir ? pourquoi as-tu conçu cette chose dans ton cœur? tu n'as pas menti aux hommes, mais à Dieu.\n5 Et Ananias, entendant ces paroles, tomba et rendit l'esprit; et une grande frayeur s'empara de tous ceux qui entendirent ces choses. 6Et les jeunes gens se levèrent, le blessèrent, l'emportèrent et l'enterrèrent.\n7 Et c'était environ l'espace de trois heures après, lorsque sa femme, ne sachant pas ce qui s'était passé, entra. 8 Et Pierre lui répondit   Dites -moi si vous avez vendu le terrain pour tant ? Et elle a dit, Oui, pour tant.\n9 Alors Pierre lui dit   Comment se fait-il que vous vous soyez mises d'accord pour tenter l'Esprit du Seigneur ? voici, les pieds de ceux qui ont enterré ton mari sont à la porte, et ils te feront sortir. 10 Alors elle tomba aussitôt à ses pieds, et rendit l'esprit; et les jeunes hommes entrèrent, et la trouvèrent morte, et, l'emportant, l'enterrèrent auprès de son mari.\n11Et une grande frayeur s'empara de toute l'Eglise, et de tous ceux qui avaient entendu ces choses.  **\nL'Esprit de Dieu a dit à Pierre qu'ils mentaient. Pourquoi chasser les gens ou les condamner sans entendre parler d'eux, après avoir entendu d'un côté ? Pourquoi automatiquement prendre parti ? Écoutez les deux parties avant le jugement.  **\nProverbes 18 verset 17   **\n17 Celui qui est le premier dans sa propre cause semble juste; mais son voisin vient et le sonde . Celui qui raconte son histoire en premier semble parfaitement juste.  **\nIl pourrait vous mettre très en colère et vous pourriez vous précipiter dans le jugement. Ne prononcez pas de jugement à la hâte ; vous pourriez vous juger et vous condamner. David l'a fait lorsque le prophète Nathan est venu lui parler du péché qu'il avait commis en tuant Urie.  **\nDeuxième Samuel 12 verset 1 à 7   **\n1 Et l'Éternel envoya Nathan vers David. Et il vint vers lui, et lui dit   Il y avait deux hommes dans une même ville ; l'un riche et l'autre pauvre. 2L'homme riche possédait un très grand nombre de brebis et de gros bétail.\n3 Mais le pauvre homme n'avait rien, sauf une petite brebis qu'il avait achetée et nourrie et qui grandissait avec lui et avec ses enfants ; elle mangea de sa propre viande, et but sa propre coupe, et se coucha sur son sein, et fut pour lui comme une fille.\nvoyageur vint vers l'homme riche, et il épargna pour prendre de son propre troupeau et de son propre gros bétail, pour s'habiller pour le voyageur qui était venu vers lui ; mais il prit l'agneau du pauvre, et l'apprêta pour l'homme qui était venu à lui.\n5 Et la colère de David s'enflamma contre cet homme ; et il dit à Nathan   Tant que l'Éternel est vivant , l'homme qui a fait cela mourra certainement ;\n6 Et il rendra l'agneau au quadruple, parce qu'il a fait cette chose, et parce qu'il n'a eu aucune pitié.\n7 Et Nathan dit à David   Tu es l'homme. Ainsi parle le Seigneur, le Dieu d'Israël   Je t'ai oint roi sur Israël, et je t'ai délivré de la main de Saül ;  **\nDavid s'est mis très en colère lorsqu'on lui a raconté une parabole de son péché. Écoutez la cause et écoutez bien les faits. Si l'adversaire est Satan, pensez-vous qu'il parlera jamais bien ?\nPouvez-vous écouter la version de l'histoire de Satan et croire et dire que l'autre homme est méchant ? Satan peut-il jamais être juste ? Si l'une des personnes impliquées est un enfant de Satan, ne pensez-vous pas que vous devez entendre l'autre personne ?  **\nJean 8 verset 44\n44 Vous avez pour père le diable, et vous ferez les désirs de votre père. Il était un meurtrier dès le commencement, et ne demeurait pas dans la vérité, car il n'y a pas de vérité en lui. Quand il prononce un mensonge, il parle du sien, car il est menteur et en est le père.  **\nNe faut-il pas écouter l'adversaire d'un enfant de Satan ?  **\nJean 7 verset 51   **\n51 Notre loi juge- t-elle quelqu'un avant de l'avoir entendu et de savoir ce qu'il fait ?  **\nDeutéronome 1 verset 16 à 17   **\n16 Et j'ai ordonné à vos juges en ce temps-là, disant   Écoutez les causes entre vos frères, et jugez avec justice entre chacun et son frère, et l'étranger qui est avec lui.\n17 Vous ne respecterez personne dans le jugement; mais vous entendrez les petits comme les grands ; vous n'aurez pas peur de la face de l'homme; car le jugement est de Dieu et la cause qui est trop dure pour vous, apportez-la-moi, et je l'entendrai.  **\nLe jugement appartient à Dieu. Dieu s'intéresse au jugement et à la justice à pratiquer.  **\n\n\n\n\nLES PARTIES SUIVANTES TRAITENT DE CE QU'IL FAUT FAIRE AU SUJET DU PÉCHÉ EN VOUS   **\n\nHUITIEME PARTIE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ EN VOUS NE DOIT PAS ÊTRE DONNÉ DE REPOS JUSQU'À CE QU'IL SOIT DISPARU   **\nLE PÉCHÉ DOIT ÊTRE ABANDONNÉ   **\nLE PÉCHÉ EN VOUS DEVEZ     **\n Ne pas vous donner de repos jusqu'à ce qu'il soit parti.  **\nÊtre exposé. **\nÊtre rejeté.  **\nÊtre amené à Jésus.  **\nÊtre détruit.  **\nÊtre remplacé par la justice de Christ.  **\nÊtre résisté fermement.  **\nLe péché peut venir à vous ou peut être en vous. En tant que pécheur, le péché est en vous. En tant que chrétien non sanctifié, le péché en vous se manifeste par un caractère impie. Que devez-vous faire à propos du péché ?  **\nNe vous reposez pas si vous voyez que le péché est dans votre vie. La langue ne se repose pas quand quelque chose est entre les dents. L'œil ne cesse de cligner quand quelque chose d'étranger entre en lui. De même, ne laissez pas votre cœur se reposer et soyez paisible lorsque le péché entre. Ne laissez pas votre vie être paisible lorsque vous découvrez que vous avez commis un péché ou que vous vivez dans le péché.\nSi, en tant que saint de Dieu, vous êtes surpris par la tentation, vous ne devriez avoir ni repos ni sommeil jusqu'à ce que le péché soit traité. Lorsque le péché apparaît, cherchant une ouverture pour gâcher votre vie, ne vous reposez pas tant que vous n'avez pas traité le péché, il n'aura donc aucune chance dans votre vie. Le péché est en vous par nature mais doit passer par votre nouvelle nature en Christ. La Bible nous dit comment gérer ce péché     **\nPsaume s 32 verset 1 à 5   **\n1 Heureux celui dont la transgression est pardonnée, dont le péché est couvert. 2 Béni soit l'homme à qui le Seigneur n'impute pas d'iniquité, et dans l'esprit duquel il n'y a pas de fraude.\n3 Quand je gardais le silence, mes os vieillissaient à force de rugir tout le jour.\n4 Car jour et nuit ta main pesait sur moi, mon humidité s'est changée en sécheresse d'été. Sélah.\n5 Je t'avoue mon péché, et je n'ai pas caché mon iniquité. J'ai dit   Je confesserai mes transgressions au Seigneur ; et tu as pardonné l'iniquité de mon péché. Sélah.  **\nBéni soit celui qui peut enlever ce qui est pris entre ses dents et ce qui fait cligner des yeux et ne donne pas de repos à l'œil. La paix entourera toujours celui qui mène une vie sans péché. Que vous ne portez pas de culpabilité ou de condamnation à cause du péché est une bénédiction. Dieu n'est pas en colère contre vous comme il l'est quotidiennement avec le pécheur. Votre cœur n'a enregistré aucun mensonge, mais il est paisible et glorieux. L'homme, David, a péché. Le juste David est tombé dans le péché d'immoralité. Il était connu pour être un homme zélé de Dieu. Il a décidé de se taire   c'est là qu'il a échoué.  **\nLe verset trois du Psaume 32 raconte ce qui s'est passé quand il s'est tu. Il tremblait intérieurement, jamais en paix. C'est ce que fait le péché. Combien de temps serez-vous dans cet état, dans cette obscurité ? Combien de temps serez-vous dans la peur de ne pas aller au ciel ? Tout comme vous pouvez entendre quelqu'un ronfler bruyamment dans son sommeil, c'est ainsi que le péché résonne bruyamment dans vos oreilles lorsque vous le commettez. Jour et nuit, ta main, oh mon Dieu, s'appesantissait sur moi. Comment ne le ferait-il pas ? Ce n'était pas la vie que Dieu lui a donnée quand il est venu à Lui. La fraîcheur de la vie a disparu. La paix de la vie a disparu et il est devenu agité. Il n'a jamais eu de repos jusqu'à ce que le péché soit parti, jusqu'à ce qu'il se soit confessé. Votre cas peut impliquer de vous confesser à votre conjoint, aux autorités ecclésiastiques ou à certaines institutions gouvernementales pour lesquelles vous avez travaillé, pour un amendement ou une restitution. Le péché en vous ne doit pas vous donner de repos tant qu'il n'est pas parti, comme dans le cas de David.  **\nDieu ne vous accordera aucun repos si vous êtes vraiment un enfant de Dieu. Il vous rappellera de régler le péché lorsque vous vous présenterez devant lui. Il veut que tu sois parfait. Obéissez à la voix de Dieu. Vous avez peut-être eu de nombreux rêves, ou de nombreuses personnes vous ont peut-être parlé de la part de Dieu concernant ce péché. Il est sage de répondre positivement et de régler les problèmes avec Dieu.  **\n\nPARTIE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ EN VOUS DOIT ÊTRE EXPOSÉ   **\nSoit vous exposez le péché, soit il s'exposera lui-même, soit quelqu'un l'exposera, soit Dieu l'exposera. Mais il doit être exposé, car il n'y a rien de caché qui ne sera révélé.  **\nProverbes 28 verset 13   **\n13 Celui qui couvre ses péchés ne prospère pas, mais celui qui les confesse et les abandonne obtient miséricorde.  **\nC'est mal de couvrir votre péché exprès. Sourir extérieurement, alors que votre cœur est lourd à l'intérieur. Vous ne pouvez pas prospérer de cette façon.\nQuelqu'un a raconté l'histoire d'une servante commettant l'immoralité avec l'homme de Dieu pour qui elle travaillait. Cet homme de Dieu a finalement demandé conseil. La personne à qui il a demandé conseil lui a demandé de prêcher contre le péché d'adultère comme moyen de s'en libérer. Il l'a fait, prêchant ouvertement sur la chaire, mais malheureusement, a continué dans l'immoralité avec la dame. Son problème n'a pas été résolu car après avoir confessé son péché, il n'a pas continué à l'abandonner.  **\nChanter des chansons pour distraire votre esprit ou votre cœur ne couvrira pas le péché. Celui qui couvre son péché ne prospère pas, mais celui qui confesse et abandonne obtient miséricorde. Au lieu de travailler comme David pour couvrir son péché, au lieu de rappeler Urie de la guerre, de lui donner à manger et à boire et de lui demander d'aller dans sa maison pour coucher avec sa femme, pour couvrir son péché, pourquoi ne pas travailler à confesser le péché? Pourquoi ne pas travailler de la bonne manière ? Transformez tout le travail couvrant vos péchés en confessions. Au lieu de vous efforcer de vous comporter humblement et doucement avec votre femme pour couvrir votre péché, utilisez tous ces efforts pour confesser vos péchés à Dieu et à elle. Cet effort que vous avez fait, en courant de haut en bas, devrait être un effort pour se confesser et faire la paix avec la personne.  **\nLe péché ne doit pas être simplement confessé. Il faut l'avouer et l'abandonner. Ne vous contentez pas de confesser le péché ; confesse-le et abandonne-le, afin que tu ne sois pas tenté d'y revenir. Comme vous le confessez, arrêtez-le et n'y allez plus.\nLa raison pour laquelle vous confessez le péché est de l'arrêter, pas de montrer de l'orgueil. Vous n'avouez pas aux autres par vengeance. Vous confessez par culpabilité et condamnation pour devenir juste afin que cela ne se reproduise plus.  **\nLe péché en vous doit être exposé.  **\nMatthieu 10 verset 26   **\n26 Ne les craignez donc pas ; car il n'y a rien de couvert qui ne soit révélé; et caché, cela ne se saura pas.  **\nEssayer de cacher votre péché est futile parce que quelqu'un le révélera un jour. Un pouvoir hors de votre contrôle révélera votre péché caché. Pendant que vous choisissez de garder le silence pour garder votre honneur intact, un pouvoir extérieur à vous, quelqu'un d'autre ou Dieu exposera le péché.\nLorsque vous visitez des fétichistes qui donnent des charmes aux gens, ils présentent une liste des personnes qu'ils ont servies ou manipulées pour vous montrer à quel point ils sont puissants. Pour nourrir leur fierté et leur objectif, ils doivent dire à la personne suivante, même s'ils ont peut-être dit à tous ceux sur la liste qu'ils opèrent discrètement et secrètement.  **\nSi vous commettez l'immoralité avec quelqu'un en secret, savez-vous que la personne se réjouit parce qu'elle a pu vous dépouiller de la gloire de Dieu ? Ces personnes partagent leurs expériences avec les autres pour se sentir bien. Ainsi, il serait préférable d'avouer ce que vous avez fait afin que la vérité se répande et que vous puissiez dire que vous êtes libre. Va dire à la femme avec qui tu as couché que tu t'es repenti. Dites à cet homme que vous vous êtes repenti pour qu'il ait honte, et sachez que lorsque vous avez péché, vous étiez à votre moment le plus faible mais que vous vous êtes rétabli. Si vous ne révélez pas votre péché, ils vous aideront à le révéler, mais quand vous le faites, vous fermez le chapitre.\nTous les sorciers qui donnent des charmes aux pasteurs vous diront à qui ils ont donné des charmes. Certains peuvent mentir, mais beaucoup disent la vérité parce qu'ils veulent la gloire. Dieu peut décider de le révéler pour montrer sa gloire sur votre vie, pour vous faire honte d'être un hypocrite   **\nLe péché se révélera en vous.  **\nNombres 32 verset 23   **\n23 Mais si vous ne le faites pas, voici, vous avez péché contre le Seigneur ; et sois sûr que ton péché te trouvera.  **\nVotre péché vous découvrira. Le péché a une loi de révélation de soi . Cet esprit voudra se révéler. Une dame se tenait avec son petit ami quand elle s'est soudainement transformée en serpent mais est rapidement revenue à elle-même. Alors qu'il jouait avec d'autres garçons, un petit garçon s'est soudainement transformé en serpent. Il a rapidement expliqué que son père et sa mère faisaient souvent cela à la maison. Ils se tournent volontairement, l'esprit démoniaque en eux a fait cela pour leur honte.\nVotre péché vous découvrira. Pourquoi attendre la grande honte ? Vous pouvez le dire inconsciemment. Finissez-en car tôt ou tard, cela répandra la honte et la ruine sur votre vie. Au moment opportun, vous commencerez à vous embarrasser. Confessez-le et éradiquez-le avant qu'il ne trouve une occasion appropriée de se révéler.  **\n\nDIX PARTIE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ EN VOUS DOIT ÊTRE REJETÉ   **\nRefusez le péché; lutter contre cela. Allez là où le péché est traité et faites-le traiter. S'il y a un hôpital où le péché est traité, allez-y. Si cela signifie rencontrer le consultant, faites-le. Si cela nécessite une intervention chirurgicale, allez-y pour le sortir de votre vie. Le péché en vous doit être rejeté.  **\nJob 34 verset 31 à 32   **\n31 Assurément, il convient de dire à Dieu   J'ai supporté le châtiment, je n'offenserai plus ;\n32 Ce que je vois, ne m'apprends rien ; si j'ai fait l'iniquité, je n'en ferai plus.  **\nDites à Dieu comment vous avez été tellement embarrassé par le péché et que vous ne le ferez plus. Vous avez souffert tant de honte et de douleur. Par conséquent, rejetez le péché qui les a conduits. Déterminez que l'affliction ne doit pas revenir. Décidez que si vous voyez le péché, vous le rejeterez. Si vous avez péché à cause de l'ignorance dans le passé, maintenant votre attitude devrait être différente à cause de la connaissance que vous avez. Si un oiseau vous voit tendre un piège, il ne s'en approchera jamais. Dites-vous   « Maintenant que je sais que c'est un péché, je ne le ferai plus. Je ne pourrai plus jamais céder au péché.\nLe péché en vous doit être rejeté. Ne lui donnez ni espace ni place. Ça doit être hors de ta vie. Il ne doit pas rester dans votre vie.  **\n\nONZE PARTIE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ EN VOUS DOIT ÊTRE APPORTÉ À JÉSUS   **\nL'église est l'hôpital. Le chirurgien consultant qui opère le péché des gens est Jésus. Il peut opérer et enlever toute sorte de péché de votre vie. Il sait comment gérer le péché dans le clergé, chez les pasteurs, les surveillants, les surintendants, les pasteurs principaux, les fondateurs d'églises, les guerriers de la prière, les femmes évangélistes, les pasteurs à domicile, les femmes des pasteurs et les enfants, etc. Il peut tout gérer - le consulter, chercher Lui, et Il le fera gratuitement.\nAllez à Lui et confessez votre mal. Demandez-lui de traiter votre problème de péché. Il sait exactement comment faire. Il est venu le chercher et le soignera.  **\nJean 1 verset 29   **\n29 Le lendemain, Jean vit Jésus venir à lui, et dit   Voici l'Agneau de Dieu, qui ôte le péché du monde.  **\nTout le monde dans le monde, vous inclut. Votre péché n'est pas pire que le péché des autres. Jésus les a tous traités. Aujourd'hui, si vous lui faites confiance, il vous aidera à jouir de la victoire sur le péché qu'il a donnée à tous ceux qui croient en lui. Il enlèvera le péché du village, de la communauté, de toute la société, de toute la tribu, de la nation et de toute la race humaine. C'est lui qui vous invite.  **\nMatthieu 11 verset 28   **\n28 Venez à moi, vous tous qui êtes fatigués et chargés, et je vous donnerai du repos.  **\nJésus te voit chargé et veut te donner du repos. Il vous promet du repos. Si vous choisissez de faire le mal, Il vous condamnera parce qu'Il vous a dit qu'Il vous libérerait et vous donnerait du repos, mais vous avez refusé. Vous êtes responsable de votre situation car vous avez délibérément refusé le repos et la paix. Parce que vous blessez ou blessez délibérément les gens et l'œuvre de Dieu, il vous jugera.\nOn a raconté l'histoire d'un homme à qui quelqu'un a prêché et à qui on a demandé de donner sa vie à Jésus et de l'accepter comme son Sauveur . On lui a également dit que s'il ne le faisait pas, il serait jugé et irait en enfer. L'homme a demandé si l'évangéliste avait lu le livre de l'Apocalypse dans la Bible. Il a souligné qu'il y était dit qu'il y aurait la guerre dans le ciel, que lorsque Jésus-Christ viendrait, il y aurait la guerre. Il a dit que la raison pour laquelle Satan a été chassé du ciel était parce qu'ils étaient peu nombreux à cette époque. \"Mais regardez la terre maintenant, nous sommes majoritaires et nous vaincrons Jésus.\"\nC'est comme du bois de chauffage qui dit   « La seule raison pour laquelle je brûle, c'est que je suis seul. Quand il n'y aura plus de bois, le feu s'éteindra. Cela peut-il être? Au lieu de cela, les flammes augmenteront. Les gens disent délibérément non à Jésus parce qu'ils veulent faire plus de méchanceté. Les jeunes disent vouloir attendre de vieillir. Ils disent   « Maman et papa, vous avez apprécié la vie. On veut aussi en profiter. » Quelle vie ont-ils appréciée ? Une vie simple est une vie de joie. Connaissez-vous les maladies auxquelles ils sont confrontés à cause de leur mauvaise vie passée ? Connaissez-vous les embarras qu'ils ont endurés ? Pensez-vous que vous pouvez faire la même chose et attendre jusqu'à la fin pour donner votre vie à Jésus ? Vous vous moquez du Seigneur. Le Seigneur a entendu votre moquerie. Attendez de voir si vous connaîtrez votre fin. Dieu détermine la fin. Certains meurent dans l'utérus, certains meurent en naissant, ou après un, deux, dix ou vingt ans. Quel âge as-tu? Beaucoup sont morts avant cet âge. Qu'est-ce qui vous fait penser que vous vivrez jusqu'à un âge avancé ? La Bible dit   Souviens-toi de ton Créateur dans les jours de ta jeunesse. Le diable augmentera votre rang dans l'iniquité et endurcira votre cœur de sorte que lorsque vous penserez qu'il est temps de vous repentir, vous ne pourrez pas le faire ; il ne vous laissera pas.\nNe vous y trompez pas   on ne se moque pas de Dieu ; tout ce qu'un homme sème, il le récoltera aussi. La Bible dit qu'au jour du salut, recevez le salut. Au bon moment, acceptez l'aide de Dieu et donnez votre vie à Jésus.  **\n\nPARTIE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ EN VOUS DOIT ÊTRE DÉTRUIT   **\nRomains 6 verset 6 à 7   **\n6 Sachant ceci, que notre vieil homme a été crucifié avec lui, afin que le corps du péché soit détruit, afin que désormais nous ne servions plus le péché.\n7 Car celui qui est mort est affranchi du péché.  **\nSi vous professez le christianisme et dites que vous êtes né de nouveau, mais que le péché se manifeste encore dans votre vie, vous êtes comme quelqu'un portant des vêtements propres avec des traînées de saleté. Qu'est-ce que tu dois faire ? Vous devez mourir pour être libéré du péché.\nAu Nigeria, les Igbos disent   « Si vous voulez savoir si un homme de la tribu Igbo est mort, allez compter l'argent près de son cadavre. S'il ne se réveille pas, alors il est bel et bien mort. C'est-à-dire qu'ils sont très exigeants en matière d'argent. Pourquoi vous fâchez-vous rapidement, en criant pour de petites choses ? Pourquoi réagissez-vous ? C'est parce que tu n'es pas mort.  **\nDans l'évangile, l'apôtre Jean a écrit que Jésus a été crucifié le jour de la préparation, la veille de la Pâque, une fête très spéciale pour les Juifs. Ils ne voulaient donc pas que des corps soient suspendus à la croix du jour au lendemain. Ils ont dû hâter sa mort et celle des voleurs qui ont été crucifiés avec lui en se cassant les jambes. Mais après avoir cassé les jambes de ces deux hommes, au moment où ils sont venus à Jésus, ils ont découvert qu'il était déjà mort, donc ils ne lui ont pas cassé les jambes. Ils ne pouvaient plus lui faire de mal. Toi aussi, tu dois mourir. Lorsque vous mourrez, les attaques et les offenses ne signifieront rien. Quand les gens mentent à votre sujet et que vous continuez à répondre, cela prouve que vous n'êtes pas encore mort ; vous êtes toujours en vie. Parfois, lorsque vous voulez savoir si quelqu'un dort, vous touchez pour vérifier et il se peut qu'il se réveille. Mais si la personne dort profondément, elle ne sentira pas votre toucher. Celui qui est mort est libéré du péché. Quoi qu'il arrive, vous n'en êtes plus conscient.  **\nLa Bible dit, sachant cela, que notre corps soit détruit et que nous ne servons pas le péché. Comment traitez-vous avec quelqu'un qui blesse votre fierté ou ne vous donne pas l' honneur qui lui revient ? Comment réagissez-vous avec quelqu'un qui vous agresse verbalement? Vos actions détermineront si vous êtes mort ou non.\nEntre mari et femme, qui est mort ? Pourquoi ne devriez-vous pas mourir tous les deux pour qu'il y ait la paix ? Ou pourquoi l'un de vous ne peut-il pas mourir de sorte que pendant que l'autre fait tout le mal, il n'y ait pas de réaction perverse, pas de riposte, pas de vengeance, aucune, parce que vous êtes mort ? Jésus était déjà mort lorsque ses ennemis sont venus le blesser davantage. Donc, il n'y a pas eu de réaction. Lorsque vous êtes mort, vous ne pouvez plus ressentir la douleur. Celui qui est couché ne craint pas la chute. Les gens humbles ne peuvent pas être brisés, mais les orgueilleux le peuvent.  **\nCelui qui est mort est exempt de péché.  **\nPremier Jean 3 verset 8   **\n8 Celui qui commet le péché est du diable; car le diable pèche dès le commencement. C'est dans ce but que le Fils de Dieu a été manifesté, afin qu'il puisse détruire les oeuvres du diable.  **\nLe péché vous expose aux attaques du diable. Mais Dieu est venu pour détruire les œuvres du diable dans votre vie, telles que le spiritisme, le démonisme, le satanisme, l'occultisme, la sorcellerie et d'autres péchés. Jésus veut tuer tous les péchés de votre vie afin que Satan ne soit pas glorifié en vous. Repentez-vous de la sorcellerie, de l'occultisme, du satanisme et d'autres maux, car vous ne pouvez pas servir deux maîtres simultanément. Le fils de Dieu a été manifesté afin qu'Il puisse détruire les oeuvres du diable. Confessez ces choses et laissez-Le les détruire. Le Seigneur est miséricordieux et vous sauvera au Nom de Jésus.  **\n\nPARTIE TREIZE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ EN VOUS DOIT ÊTRE REMPLACÉ PAR LA JUSTICE DE CHRIST   **\nRomains 8 verset 3 à 4   **\n3 Car ce que la loi n'a pas pu faire, en ce qu'elle était faible par la chair, Dieu envoyant son propre Fils dans la ressemblance d'une chair pécheresse, et pour le péché, a condamné le péché dans la chair  \n4Afin que la justice de la loi soit accomplie en nous, qui marchons non selon la chair, mais selon l'Esprit.  **\nIl n'y a rien de mal avec la loi parce que la loi est morale. Tu ne tueras pas, tu ne voleras pas, tu ne commettras pas d'adultère, tu ne mentiras pas, tu n'auras pas d'autres dieux que moi, tu ne convoiteras pas la femme et les biens de ton prochain . Tous ces commandements peuvent être compris dans le commandement de l'amour   tu aimeras le Seigneur ton Dieu de tout ton cœur, de toute ton âme, de tout ton esprit et de toute ta force, et tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi- même .\nIl n'y avait rien de mal avec la loi ou les commandements. Ce qui n'allait pas, c'était le péché à l'intérieur de l'homme. Le péché a une forteresse à l'intérieur de l'homme.\nLa loi est devenue émoussée à cause de la puissance du péché dans l'homme. Il fallait faire quelque chose de plus fort. Le péché dans l'homme était plus fort que la loi. Dieu est allé chercher quelque chose de plus élevé pour détruire le péché   la mort de Jésus-Christ, son Fils unique. La justice de la loi ne pouvait être accomplie que par la mort d'un pécheur. Jésus l'a fait pour le bien de l'homme. L'homme peut maintenant pratiquer la justice de la loi. Vous pouvez maintenant observer la loi par Christ parce que Jésus a contrôlé la forteresse du péché en vous. Vous êtes maintenant juste par lui et pouvez pratiquer la justice, la puissance au-dessus du péché.  **\nLe péché en vous doit être remplacé par la justice de Christ – la justice que Christ fournit. Demande-le; vous l'obtiendrez en Christ. Nous ne sommes plus sous la loi mais sous la grâce en Christ. Vous pouvez maintenant adorer, plier, vous incliner, céder et pratiquer la droiture. Prends-le, reçois-le, au nom de Jésus ! Ne pensez pas que vous ne pouvez pas sortir du péché parce que Jésus a réglé ce qui fait que les gens restent esclaves du péché.  **\nRomains 7 verset 14 à 25   **\n14 Car nous savons que la loi est spirituelle, mais je suis charnel, vendu au péché. 15 Car ce que je fais, je ne le permets pas ; car ce que je voudrais, je ne le fais pas ; mais ce que je déteste, c'est moi.\n16 Si donc je fais ce que je ne voudrais pas, je conviens à la loi que c'est bon. 17 Maintenant donc, ce n'est plus moi qui le fais, mais le péché qui habite en moi.\n18 Car je sais qu'en moi (c'est-à-dire dans ma chair) n'habite rien de bon , car le vouloir est présent avec moi ; mais comment faire ce qui est bon, je ne le trouve pas.\n19 Car le bien que je voudrais, je ne le fais pas ; mais le mal que je ne voudrais pas, je le fais. 20 Or, si je fais ce que je ne veux pas, ce n'est plus moi qui le fais, mais le péché qui habite en moi. 21 Je trouve donc une loi selon laquelle, quand je veux faire le bien, le mal est présent avec moi.\n22 Car je prends plaisir à la loi de Dieu selon l'homme intérieur;\n23 Mais je vois une autre loi dans mes membres, qui fait la guerre à la loi de mon esprit, et me rend captif de la loi du péché qui est dans mes membres. 24 O misérable que je suis ! qui me délivrera du corps de cette mort ?\n25 Je rends grâces à Dieu par Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur. Ainsi donc, avec l'esprit, je sers moi-même la loi de Dieu ; mais avec la chair la loi du péché.  **\nLa loi est bonne ; C'est correct. Ne permettez à personne de voler votre propriété ou de vous mentir au sujet de la loi. Mais l'homme ne pouvait pas lui obéir à cause de la fonte de fer du péché en lui. La loi veut que vous vous prosterniez et que vous vous humiliiez pour adorer Dieu de manière acceptable. Le péché est la fonte. Mais le péché est le métal solide qui ne vous permettrait jamais de vous pencher pour adorer Dieu, selon la loi.  **\nAu verset 18, il dit   « Je veux vivre la vie que je sais que je devrais, mais je ne sais pas comment. Comment puis-je être libre ? Le coutelas et le couteau n'ont pas réussi à couper la porte de fer du péché. Cela nécessitait une force plus forte. Jésus est venu comme cette puissance plus forte pour démanteler (détruire) le péché en moi. Verset 22. « En moi, j'aime faire l'œuvre de Dieu, mais mes membres   oreilles, yeux, mains et pieds se plaisent dans le péché. Vos oreilles veulent entendre des choses pécheresses et votre langue aime raconter des mensonges. Le péché en vous les contrôle.\nVerset 24 – « Ce corps est pour l'enfer, où vais-je ? Qui me délivrera ? Jésus est la solution au problème du péché   Dieu a envoyé son fils à la ressemblance de l'homme pécheur et a condamné le péché dans la chair.\nVerset 25 – Vous pouvez être libre. Jésus a détruit la puissance du péché dans votre vie. Le Lion de la tribu de Juda a vaincu pour ouvrir le livre et la porte de la justice. Entrez par la porte de la justice et célébrez la justice et la sainteté. Jésus est cette porte.  **\nPsaumes 118 verset 19   **\nOuvrez-moi les portes de la justice; J'entrerai en eux, et je louerai l' Éternel   **\nJean 10 verset 9   **\n9 Je suis la porte, par moi si quelqu'un entre, il sera sauvé, et il entrera et sortira, et trouvera des pâturages.  **\n\nPARTIE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ DOIT ÊTRE RÉSISTÉ FERMEMENT   **\nDécider de rester ferme contre le péché est une belle chose. Être enfant de Dieu ne vous dispense pas de la tentation. Vivre une vie sainte ne vous dispense pas de la tentation   les oiseaux volent toujours au-dessus de votre maison.  **\nPremier Pierre 5 verset 8 à 10   **\n8 Sois sobre, sois vigilant ; parce que votre adversaire, le diable, rôde comme un lion rugissant, cherchant qui il dévorera ;\n9 Qui résistez avec fermeté dans la foi, sachant que les mêmes afflictions s'accomplissent chez vos frères qui sont dans le monde.\n10 Mais le Dieu de toute grâce, qui nous a appelés à sa gloire éternelle par le Christ Jésus, après que vous aurez souffert un certain temps, vous rendra parfait, vous affermira, vous fortifiera, vous affermira.  **\nN'utilisez pas le péché pour combattre le péché. Utilisez la foi. Le péché multiplié par le péché est le péché ; le péché plus le péché est le péché. N'utilisez pas une méthode pécheresse pour faire face à la tentation. Les méthodes charnelles ne fonctionnent pas. Vous devez résister dans la foi. Une fois, alors que j'étais à l'aéroport pour voyager, l'une des hôtesses s'est approchée et s'est assise les jambes écartées. J'ai tourné dans l'autre sens. Je n'ai pas eu à la confronter. Ses aînés étaient présents. Pour me sauver, je me suis détourné. Le péché peut-il combattre le péché ? Résistez-y avec la direction et la sagesse du Saint-Esprit. Résistez au péché par la prière et les bonnes actions.  **\nVous n'êtes pas le seul à être tenté. Dieu le permet dans un but; pour vous assurer d'apprendre une ou des leçons vitales. C'est pourquoi il a permis à Satan de tester Job. S'il testait Job, Il vous permettrait également d'être testé. Il permettra aux épreuves de vous tester. Par exemple, il peut permettre à quelqu'un de renverser accidentellement de l'eau sur vous. Comment réagiriez-vous ?  **\nFaites de votre mieux pour rester pur, peu importe la tentation. Montrez que vous avez entendu la Parole sonore, qui est capable de vous délivrer. Vos vêtements étaient mouillés d'eau, pas votre âme. Gardez votre âme en toute diligence; garde ton coeur. Votre âme ne peut être affectée que si vous commencez à abuser de l'homme et que vous vous préparez à un combat ou à un plan de vengeance ou de mal. Sinon, éclabousser de l'eau sur votre corps n'a pas affecté votre âme. Votre âme ne sera affectée que si vous devenez en colère et amer. C'est l'âme qui pèche qui mourra. Le corps a reçu des éclaboussures, mais l'âme n'a pas péché.\nRésistez au diable inébranlable dans la foi. Certains d'entre vous travaillent dans des endroits terribles. Vous devez continuer à prier pour que Dieu vous garde pendant la période où vous êtes là.  **\nLe verset 10 nous assure de la grâce de Dieu qui est rendue disponible et qui est suffisante alors que nous traversons les épreuves. Dieu est le Dieu de toute grâce. Vous pouvez être sans péché là où Il vous positionne comme Daniel dans le royaume de Babylone ou Abdias dans le cabinet de Jézabel et Achab.\nDieu fait mûrir des fils pour cette fin des temps, vous enseignant à continuer à vous tenir au-dessus du diable et de ses plans. Le diable ne peut pas vous abattre de toutes ses ruses parce qu'il est sous vos pieds. Connaître et rester dans la vérité de Dieu ; il vous rendra toujours libre.  **\nPsaume 119 verset 98   **\n98 Par tes commandements, tu m'as rendu plus sage que mes ennemis, car ils sont toujours avec moi.  **\nIl vous donne cette vérité pour vous rendre plus sage, afin que vous vainquiez lorsque le diable viendra comme un lion rugissant. Vous êtes bâti sur le roc.  **\n\n\n\nLES PARTIES SUIVANTES TRAITENT DE CE QU'IL FAUT FAIRE AU SUJET DU PÉCHÉ CHEZ LES AUTRES   **\n\nCHAPITRE QUINZE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ CHEZ LES AUTRES DEVRAIT ATTIRER VOTRE PITIÉ   **\nLe péché chez les autres devrait     **\nAttirez votre pitié.  **\nAttirez vos prières.  **\nVous rapprocher d'eux.  **\nAttirez le message d'évangélisation.  **\nAttirer les méthodes de gain d'âme   **\nVous faire dépenser pour leur salut.  **\nFaites-vous mépriser la persécution pour leur salut.  **\nCela devrait être lorsque vous avez déjà réglé votre problème de péché. Il faut qu'un hypocrite soit occupé avec les péchés des autres alors qu'il est aussi encore dans le péché.  **\nMatthieu 7 verset 3 à 5   **\n3 Et pourquoi vois -tu la paille qui est dans l'œil de ton frère, mais ne considères -tu pas la poutre qui est dans ton œil ?\n4 Ou comment diras-tu à ton frère   Laisse -moi arracher la paille de ton œil ; Et voici, une poutre est dans ton œil ?\n5 Hypocrite, ôte d'abord la poutre de ton oeil; et alors tu verras clair pour ôter la paille de l'oeil de ton frère.  **\nCette écriture s'adresse à ceux qui sont occupés à s'occuper des péchés dans la vie des autres. Pourquoi dites-vous à quelqu'un   « Il y a quelque chose dans ton œil ; ouvrez vos yeux pour que je puisse enlever la particule qu'il contient », lorsqu'une plus grosse bûche est dans votre œil ? Comment pourriez-vous même ouvrir vos propres yeux? Vous ne pourrez pas ouvrir l'œil ; il clignotera sérieusement parce qu'un plus gros morceau est dans votre œil. C'est ainsi que se comportent les hypocrites. Vous ne pouvez rien obtenir avec ce genre de comportement . D'abord, enlevez ce qui est dans votre œil. Comme vous le voyez bien maintenant, vous pouvez aider un autre. Dieu s'attend à ce que vous vous soigniez d'abord. Ensuite, vous pourrez soigner les autres.  **\nPaul nous dit dans Philippiens 1 verset 21 à 26,   **\nPhilippiens 1 verset 21 à 26   **\n21 Car pour moi, vivre c'est Christ, et mourir est un gain. 22 Mais si je vis dans la chair, c'est le fruit de mon travail , mais ce que je choisirai, je ne le saurai pas.\n23 Car je suis dans une situation difficile entre deux, ayant le désir de partir et d'être avec Christ ; ce qui est bien mieux  \n24 Néanmoins, il vous est plus nécessaire de demeurer dans la chair. 25 Et ayant cette confiance, je sais que je demeurerai et que je continuerai avec vous tous pour votre avancement et la joie de la foi ;\n26 Afin que votre joie soit plus abondante en Jésus-Christ pour moi, par ma venue de nouveau auprès de vous.  **\nIci, Paul dit   « Je suis prêt à rentrer chez moi. Le péché a été traité dans ma vie. Je suis juste et maintenant qualifié pour rentrer chez moi. Je peux prier Dieu pour qu'il me ramène à la maison, mais je lutte. Aller au ciel maintenant est bon pour moi ; Je le choisis, mais je ressens aussi pour toi qu'il vaut mieux que je ne parte pas maintenant, afin que je puisse travailler davantage sur toi, sur les questions de péché dans ta vie, pour t'établir davantage   en Christ, afin que tu devrait être plus heureux d'être libéré du péché.\nPaul a été sauvé, délivré et il a vaincu le péché. Avec cela, il était prêt à travailler sur les autres, pour les sauver du péché par la grâce de Dieu. Vous devez d'abord être sauvé et délivré pour être engagé dans le ministère de sauver les autres dans l'esclavage du péché, comme le Seigneur donne la grâce. Pourquoi le péché chez les autres devrait-il attirer votre pitié ? Cela inclut même ceux qui vous persécutent, vous haïssent ou font du mal contre vous. Parce que le Jugement du péché est très grand.  **\nMarc 9 versets 43 à 47\n43 Et si ta main t'offense, coupe-la , il vaut mieux pour toi entrer dans la vie mutilé, que d'avoir deux mains pour aller dans la géhenne, dans le feu qui ne s'éteindra jamais ;\n44 Où leur ver ne meurt pas, et où le feu ne s'éteint pas. 45 Et si ton pied t'offense, coupe-le , il vaut mieux pour toi entrer par halte dans la vie, que d'avoir deux pieds pour être jeté dans la géhenne, dans le feu qui ne s'éteindra jamais ; 46 Où leur ver ne meurt pas, et où le feu ne s'éteint pas.\n47 Et si ton œil t'offense, arrache-le   il vaut mieux pour toi entrer dans le royaume de Dieu avec un œil, que d'avoir deux yeux pour être jeté dans le feu de l'enfer  **\nC'est la situation des pécheurs. L'âme qui pèche mourra.  **\nÉzéchiel 18 verset 20   **\n20L'âme qui pèche , c'est celle qui mourra. Le fils ne portera pas l'iniquité du père, et le père ne portera pas l'iniquité du fils, la justice du juste sera sur lui, et la méchanceté du méchant sera sur lui.  **\nLes méchants seront transformés en enfer et toutes les nations qui oublient Dieu. C'est le lieu éternel des pécheurs   le feu ardent est le jugement des pécheurs. Ne faut-il pas plaindre ceux qui y vont ? N'allez-vous pas plaindre votre mère et votre père qui s'y rendent ? N'allez-vous pas plaindre vos proches, vos voisins qui finiront en enfer, et aussi les musulmans et autres de diverses religions qui finiront en enfer ? C'est pourquoi vous devez plaindre les autres.  **\nLamentations 1 verset 16   **\n16 A cause de ces choses je pleure; mon œil, mon œil ruisselle d'eau, parce que le consolateur qui devrait soulager mon âme est loin de moi, mes enfants sont désolés, parce que l'ennemi l'a emporté.  **\nJe me sens triste parce que Satan semble avoir prévalu, surtout quand je vois le style de vie pécheur de nombreuses personnes dans notre société et même dans l'église. Certaines statistiques révèlent que 34% de la population mondiale sont chrétiens. Ce qui signifie que 66% sont païens et non chrétiens . Sur les 34%, 17,4% sont catholiques et 16,6 sont non catholiques. C'est très triste !\nNotez que ce 16,6% de chrétiens non catholiques comprend les témoins de Jéhovah, les spirites et toutes sortes de personnes ; sont également inclus ceux qui escaladent les montagnes, descendent dans les rivières et mangent du sable, de l'herbe et font beaucoup d'autres choses étranges.\nDe ces 16,6%, combien vont à l'église ? Peut-être moins de vingt pour cent sont nés de nouveau. Beaucoup nient la vérité d'être né de nouveau. Combien y a-t-il de vauriens pentecôtistes qui ne connaissent pas Jésus ? Combien d'évangéliques qui refusent le Saint-Esprit et ne parlent pas du parler en langues ? Combien connaissent la sainteté et la justice ? Combien dans les églises les plus saintes sont encore des pécheurs et des hypocrites ? Combien sont prêts pour l'enlèvement ? Combien seront qualifiés pour aller avec Jésus ? L'Ecriture nous dit que seul un petit nombre     **\nMatthieu 7 verset 13 à 14   **\n13 Entrez par la porte étroite ; car large est la porte, spacieux est le chemin qui mènent à la perdition, et il y en a beaucoup qui entrent par là ; 14 Car étroite est la porte, resserré le chemin qui mènent à la vie, et il y en a peu qui les trouvent.  **\nL'eunuque éthiopien venant d'une conférence n'a pas compris les écritures. Ces personnes dans les soi-disant églises chrétiennes connaissent-elles les Écritures ? 95 N'étiez-vous pas l'un d'eux ? Si vous étiez seul, diriez-vous hardiment que vous auriez connu Jésus et que votre nom était dans le Livre de Vie ?\nL'enfer est l'endroit où vont votre mère, votre frère, vos amis et vos relations incrédules. L'enfer est l'endroit où vont les incrédules de votre tribu, de votre nation et de votre monde. Si vous êtes véritablement sauvé, ayez pitié d'eux et faites tout ce qui est en votre pouvoir et par la grâce de Dieu pour les voir sauvés, mûris en Christ et préparés pour l'enlèvement. Ayez pitié du président, du gouverneur, du pilote, du général d'armée, du directeur général, du commissaire, des sénateurs, des écoliers, des étudiants, des marchandes et des voisins incrédules qui ne sont pas sauvés. Leur lendemain n'est pas bon.  **\nOui, le péché chez les autres doit et devrait attirer votre pitié.  **\nMatthieu 18 verset 23 à 34   **\n23 C'est pourquoi le royaume des cieux est semblable à un certain roi, qui tiendrait compte de ses serviteurs.\n24 Et lorsqu'il eut commencé à compter, on lui en amena un qui lui devait dix mille talents.\n25 Mais comme il n'avait pas à payer, son seigneur ordonna de le vendre, ainsi que sa femme et ses enfants, et tout ce qu'il possédait, et de payer.\n26 Le serviteur se prosterna donc et se prosterna devant lui, en disant   Seigneur, aie patience envers moi, et je te paierai tout. 27 Alors le maître de ce serviteur fut ému de compassion, le lâcha et lui remit la dette.\n28 Mais le même serviteur sortit, et trouva un de ses compagnons de service , qui lui devait cent deniers ; et il lui imposa les mains, et le prit à la gorge, en disant   Paye-moi ce que tu dois .\n29 Et son compagnon de service tomba à ses pieds, et le pria, disant   Aie patience envers moi, et je te paierai tout.\n30 Et il ne voulut pas, mais alla le jeter en prison, jusqu'à ce qu'il ait payé la dette.\n31 Lorsque ses compagnons de service virent ce qui s'était passé, ils furent très attristés et vinrent raconter à leur maître tout ce qui s'était passé.\n32 Alors son maître, après l'avoir appelé, lui dit   Ô méchant serviteur, je t'ai remis toute cette dette, parce que tu m'as désiré .\n33 N'aurais-tu pas dû aussi avoir pitié de ton compagnon, comme j'ai eu pitié de toi ?\n34 Et son seigneur se mit en colère , et le livra aux bourreaux, jusqu'à ce qu'il ait payé tout ce qui lui était dû.  **\nImaginons que le premier serviteur de cette histoire soit un Chinois, un Indien, un Asiatique, un Américain rétrograde ou un catholique, ou quelqu'un de n'importe quelle autre église. Le Seigneur a fait preuve de compassion et l'a délivré. Le Seigneur lui a permis d'arriver à la connaissance de la vérité, d'être sauvé et d'être libéré du péché. La question pour vous est, que faites-vous à cette personne asiatique, indienne, américaine ou africaine à votre place et à propos des autres qui vont en enfer ? Avez-vous pitié d'eux? Les considérez-vous et vous inquiétez-vous de l'endroit où ils finiront? Êtes-vous assis immobile et pas dérangé?\nDieu qui vous l'a donné peut le révoquer. Il vous a épargné pour sauver les autres, pour vous occuper des péchés des autres. Ne vous efforcerez -vous pas d'amener vos parents à Jésus. Si vous ne faites rien, vous perdrez votre salut. Faites tout ce qui est en votre pouvoir pour gagner les perdus à Christ. Que Dieu voie votre travail pour qu'ils soient sauvés.\nAvec tout ce que j'ai fait jusqu'ici, je ne suis pas encore satisfait; Je réfléchis toujours à la prochaine chose à faire, prier pour plus de livres et comment développer Son ministère. Comment pourriez-vous être moins soucieux du salut des hommes ?  **\n\n\nSEIZE PARTIE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ CHEZ LES AUTRES DOIT ATTIRER VOTRE PRIÈRE   **\nLe péché chez d'autres a attiré la prière de Paul.  **\nRomains 10 verset 1 à 4   **\nla prière de mon cœur à Dieu pour Israël, c'est qu'ils soient sauvés. 2 Car je leur rends témoignage qu'ils ont du zèle pour Dieu, mais pas selon la connaissance.\n3 Car, ignorant la justice de Dieu, et cherchant à établir leur propre justice, ils ne se sont pas soumis à la justice de Dieu. 4 Car Christ est la fin de la loi pour la justice de quiconque croit.  **\nPaul priait continuellement Dieu pour que les Israélites soient sauvés. Par cette intercession, un par un, ils viennent à Jésus, jusqu'à la tribulation, quand tout Israël sera sauvé.\nQuelle est la justice que Dieu demande ? Foi au Seigneur Jésus. Mais les Israélites ne savaient pas que leur Messie était venu dans le monde. Il est venu chez les siens, et les siens ne l'ont pas reçu. Israël ne savait pas que son Seigneur était venu dans le monde. Paul était blessé que ses compatriotes n'aient pas compris que leur Sauveur était venu. Il était accablé. Ils étaient zélés à observer le sabbat. En défendant la loi de Moïse, ils voudraient tuer les autres, même ceux qui parlent de Jésus, et Paul était l'un d'entre eux. Il pria pour que les écailles tombent de leurs yeux. Dieu, souviens-toi des catholiques. Ils se rassemblent dans leurs multitudes tôt le matin. Les rues sont remplies quand ils sortent d'un supposé culte de Dieu, mais ils vont se rassembler pour une supposée mère de Jésus. Faites un tour. Que vois-tu? Vous voyez des champs mûrs pour la moisson.\nConsidérez les autres églises où le Dieu de sainteté n'est pas connu. La justice qu'ils connaissent, ce sont les mouchoirs, l'huile d'onction et l'adoration de leurs pasteurs. Ils ne connaissent pas Jésus. Leurs pasteurs n'ont pas bien présenté Jésus. Ayez pitié d'eux, priez pour eux. Implorez Dieu pour eux.\nLisez le livre « Révélation divine et exposition des Écritures ». Il raconte l'histoire de la façon dont le Seigneur a emmené Sœur Ladi dans certaines assemblées avec de grandes cathédrales, avec seulement deux ou trois personnes vivant véritablement pour Jésus. Elle est allée dans de nombreux endroits et s'est demandée pourquoi beaucoup de gens n'aimaient pas Jésus.\nJésus ne veut pas revenir en larmes. Vous pouvez vous demander pourquoi Dieu ne peut pas simplement sauver les gens. Pourquoi devons-nous prier pour qu'ils soient sauvés ? Dieu s'est limité aux prières. Il faut donc prier pour le salut des âmes. Même Jésus a prié quand il a marché sur cette terre. Dans le jardin de Gethsémané, il comptait sur Pierre, Jacques et Jean pour le soutenir par la prière dans ses moments difficiles. Un autre exemple est la prophétesse Anne qui est enregistrée comme celle qui a prié pour le salut d'Israël.  **\n Luc 2 verset 36 à 39   **\n36 Et il y avait une Anne, prophétesse, fille de Phanuel, de la tribu d' Aser ; elle était d'un grand âge, et avait vécu avec un mari sept ans depuis sa virginité ;\n37 Et elle était une veuve d'environ quatre-vingt-quatre ans, qui ne quittait pas le temple, mais servait Dieu avec des jeûnes et des prières nuit et jour.\n38 Et elle, venant en ce moment, rendit également grâces au Seigneur, et parla de lui à tous ceux qui attendaient la rédemption à Jérusalem.  **\nPouvez-vous vous lever tôt pour prier pour ces églises ? Priez pour leurs ministres, les membres de la chorale et les membres de ces églises afin qu'ils soient sauvés.  **\nPremier Jean 5 verset 16   **\n16 Si quelqu'un voit son frère commettre un péché qui ne mène pas à la mort, il le demandera, et il lui donnera la vie pour ceux qui ne pèchent pas jusqu'à la mort. Il y a un péché jusqu'à la mort   je ne dis pas qu'il priera pour cela.  **\nSi quelqu'un commet un péché, pas jusqu'à la mort, priez pour lui, ou priez pour elle.\nUne femme voulait que son jeune frère, un ivrogne, soit sauvé. Elle est venue à l'église pour parler de la situation. Elle a déclaré qu'elle ne mangerait rien tant qu'elle n'aurait pas vu son frère converti. Elle s'est consacrée à prier pour le salut du frère. Il était assis à l'église, ivre. Les gens venaient la voir pour lui dire que son frère avait fait son choix. Une semaine, deux semaines passèrent, et son frère continua à pécher pendant qu'elle mourait.\nQuand les gens l'ont vue mourir, ils l'ont découragée. \"Pourquoi vas-tu te tuer pour quelqu'un d'autre ?\" Elle est venue à l'église pour déclarer que son corps était faible et qu'elle allait bientôt mourir pour de bon. Elle a maintenu sa position  \"Comme je l'ai proposé, je ne peux pas le briser jusqu'à ce que mon frère soit converti.\" Le frère était dans l'église, ivre. Mais ce jour-là fidèle, le démon de l'ivresse le quitta, et il se précipita vers l'autel et donna sa vie à Jésus. Gloire à Dieu!\nPriez pour l'homme qui commet un péché qui ne va pas jusqu'à la mort. Votre femme ou votre mari a-t-il péché ? Le péché n'est-il pas jusqu'à la mort ? Votre fils n'a-t-il pas péché jusqu'à la mort ? Le péché jusqu'à la mort est un péché contre le Saint-Esprit. C'est un blasphème contre le Saint-Esprit. Votre mère n'a-t-elle pas péché jusqu'à la mort ? Vous lui devez des prières ; tu dois des prières à ta sœur. Le Dieu qui vous a appelé à prier les touchera où qu'ils soient.  **\nMatthieu 12 verset 31 à 32 dit   **\n31 C'est pourquoi je vous dis   Toute sorte de péché et de blasphème sera pardonné aux hommes, mais le blasphème contre le Saint-Esprit ne sera pas pardonné aux hommes.\n32 Et quiconque parlera contre le Fils de l'homme, cela lui sera pardonné , mais quiconque parlera contre le Saint-Esprit, cela ne lui sera pas pardonné, ni dans ce monde, ni dans le monde à venir.  **\nLa Bible dit qu'il y a un péché jusqu'à la mort. Je ne vous demande pas de prier pour cela. Le Seigneur a dit à Jérémie de ne pas prier pour eux.  **\nJérémie 7 verset 16   **\n16 C'est pourquoi ne prie pas pour ce peuple, n'élève ni cri ni prière pour lui, et n'intercède pas auprès de moi; car je ne t'entendrai pas.  **\nJérémie 11 verset 14   **\n14 C'est pourquoi, ne prie pas pour ce peuple, n'élève ni cri ni prière pour lui, car je ne l'entendrai pas au moment où il criera vers moi à cause de sa détresse.  **\nNous devrions prier pour tous ceux qui viennent prier et prier pour tous les pécheurs SAUF si le Saint-Esprit donne spécifiquement une parole de connaissance pour laquelle on ne devrait pas prier pour quelqu'un. L'histoire ci-dessous est un exemple  \nLors d'une visite du Seigneur au terrain de camping, le Seigneur a parlé de quelqu'un disant   « Celui-ci a franchi la ligne. N'est-ce pas un péché jusqu'à la mort ? Aucun salut ne peut plus venir à un tel. Ce péché ne peut plus être pardonné. Ne priez pas pour ceux dont le Seigneur vous montre qu'ils ont franchi la ligne. Les médecins connaissent ceux qui ont franchi la ligne et ne peuvent pas être aidés à revenir à la vie. Par exemple, les personnes dans le coma qui vivent avec le soutien des machines. Il est conseillé aux proches de ces personnes de ne plus gaspiller d'argent. Dans la même optique, quand quelqu'un commet un péché jusqu'à la mort, il n'est pas nécessaire de prier pour cette personne. Ils sont partis!  **\n\nPARTIE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ CHEZ LES AUTRES DEVRAIT VOUS APPROCHER   **\nMatthieu 9 verset 9 à 13   **\n9 Et comme Jésus sortait de là, il vit un homme, nommé Matthieu, assis au reçu de la coutume ; et il lui dit   Suis-moi. Et il se leva, et le suivit.\n10 Et il arriva que, comme Jésus était à table dans la maison, voici, beaucoup de publicains et de pécheurs vinrent et s'assirent avec lui et ses disciples.\n11 Et quand les pharisiens virent cela, ils dirent à ses disciples   Pourquoi mange ton maître avec les publicains et les pécheurs ?\n12 Mais Jésus, ayant entendu cela, leur dit   Ce ne sont pas ceux qui se portent bien qui ont besoin de médecin, mais ceux qui sont malades.\n13 Mais allez et apprenez ce que cela signifie   J'aurai pitié, et non pas de sacrifice, car je ne suis pas venu appeler des justes, mais des pécheurs à la repentance.  **\nLe Seigneur savait que les publicains, les collecteurs d'impôts et tous ceux appelés pécheurs par la société étaient avec lui à table dans la maison de Matthieu. Il était avec eux, parlant et riant, tandis que les pharisiens étaient là, murmurant. Jésus leur a dit que les personnes en bonne santé n'ont pas besoin de médecin, mais que les malades en ont besoin. En d'autres termes, puisqu'ils n'admettaient pas qu'ils étaient malades, ils n'avaient pas besoin de Lui. D'un autre côté, ceux avec qui Jésus mangeait et s'attiraient des accusations de la part des chefs religieux reconnaissaient ouvertement leur besoin de Lui. Jésus a dit à ses accusateurs qu'il était nécessaire là où se trouvent les pécheurs parce qu'il est venu pour sauver les pécheurs, pas les justes .\nSi je fais le commerce de certains matériaux, je dois aller là où se trouvent ceux qui en ont besoin. Ceux qui vendent dans la rue vont là où les gens se rassemblent parce que c'est là que se trouvent ceux qui ont soif pour acheter de l'eau. Ils vont là où des véhicules sont garés avec des gens.\nC'est ce que Jésus a fait. Premièrement, Il est venu sur la terre plein de pécheurs, et pendant qu'il était sur terre, Il s'est déplacé dans les villages et les villes, prêchant la Bonne Nouvelle du Royaume. En suivant son exemple, le péché des autres devrait vous rapprocher d'eux. Liez-vous d'amitié ou engagez une conversation avec des pécheurs pour partager l'évangile avec eux. Ne vous sentez pas trop saint pour fuir les pécheurs. Un soldat court vers la guerre, pas loin de la guerre. En tant que soldat dans l'armée de Dieu, vous courez là où les pécheurs sont avec l'évangile et non loin d'eux.\nComment fuir d'où viennent les balles ? Pour abattre vos ennemis en temps de guerre, vous devez pouvoir les voir. Alors vous vous déplacez dans la direction des balles. Un soldat qui fuit la guerre n'est qu'un lâche. Vous ne voulez pas être un chrétien lâche. Vous êtes un soldat dans l'armée de Dieu. Allez sur le champ de bataille. Allez dans le monde et gagnez des âmes pour Christ.\nVous devez être intéressé par le salut de vos parents, frères et sœurs, oncles, tantes, cousins, voisins , collègues et autres autour de vous. Visitez-les, saluez-les et offrez-leur des cadeaux. Mais comment pouvez-vous être fructueux lorsque vous ne saluez personne, que vous n'êtes jamais joyeux et que vous n'interagissez avec personne ?  **\nActes 8 verset 26 à 37   **\n26 Et l'ange de l'Éternel parla à Philippe, disant   Lève-toi, et va vers le midi, sur le chemin qui descend de Jérusalem à Gaza, qui est un désert.\n27 Et il se leva et s'en alla. Et voici, un homme d'Éthiopie, un eunuque de grande autorité sous Candace, reine des Éthiopiens, qui avait la charge de tout son trésor, et était venu à Jérusalem pour adorer, 28 revenait, et assis sur son char, il lut Ésaïe le prophète.\n29 Alors l'Esprit dit à Philippe   Approche -toi, et joins-toi à ce char. 30 Et Philippe courut vers lui, et l'entendit lire le prophète Ésaïe, et dit   Comprends- tu ce que tu lis ?\n31 Et il dit   Comment le pourrais-je, si quelqu'un ne me conduisait ? Et il pria Philippe de venir s'asseoir avec lui.\n32 Le lieu de l'Écriture qu'il lut était celui-ci   Il a été conduit comme une brebis à l'abattoir ; et comme un agneau muet devant celui qui le tond, ainsi il n'ouvrit pas la bouche;\n33 Dans son humiliation, son jugement a été ôté et qui déclarera sa génération ? car sa vie est ôtée de la terre.\n34 Et l'eunuque répondit à Philippe, et dit   Je te prie, de qui parle ainsi le prophète ? de lui-même ou d'un autre homme ?\n35 Alors Philippe ouvrit la bouche, et commença par la même écriture, et lui prêcha Jésus.\n36 Et comme ils continuaient leur chemin, ils arrivèrent à une certaine eau et l'eunuque dit   Voici, voici de l'eau ; qu'est-ce qui m'empêche d'être baptisé?\n37 Et Philippe dit   Si tu crois de tout ton cœur, tu peux. Et il répondit et dit   Je crois que Jésus-Christ est le Fils de Dieu.  **\nPhilippe a été accepté, et ce n'est qu'après cela qu'il a prêché Jésus. Le péché chez les autres devrait vous rapprocher d'eux.  **\n \nPARTIE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ CHEZ LES AUTRES DOIT ATTIRER UN MESSAGE ÉVANGÉLISTIQUE   **\nLuc 13 verset 1 à 5   **\n1 Il y avait là en ce temps-là quelques-uns qui lui parlaient des Galiléens , dont Pilate avait mêlé le sang à leurs sacrifices.\n2 Et Jésus, répondant, leur dit   Supposez- vous que ces Galiléens étaient plus pécheurs que tous les Galiléens , parce qu'ils ont souffert de telles choses ? 3 Je vous le dis, non ; mais, à moins que vous ne vous repentiez, vous périrez tous également.\n4 Ou ces dix-huit sur qui la tour de Siloé est tombée et les a tués, pensez-vous qu'ils étaient plus pécheurs que tous les hommes qui habitaient à Jérusalem ?\n5 Je vous le dis, non ; mais, à moins que vous ne vous repentiez, vous périrez tous également.  **\nIl parlait aux pécheurs parce que le péché était en eux. Il devrait dessiner un message d'évangélisation.  **\nMichée 3 verset 8 à 9   **\n8 Mais vraiment, je suis plein de puissance par l'esprit du Seigneur, et de jugement, et de force, pour déclarer à Jacob sa transgression, et à Israël son péché. 9 Écoutez ceci, je vous prie, chefs de la maison de Jacob et princes de la maison d'Israël, qui abhorrez le jugement et pervertissez toute équité.  **\nEsaïe 58 verset 1 à 3   **\n1 Crie à haute voix, ne t'épargne pas, élève ta voix comme une trompette, et annonce à mon peuple sa transgression, et à la maison de Jacob ses péchés.\n2Pourtant ils me recherchent chaque jour et se plaisent à connaître mes voies, comme une nation qui pratique la justice et n'abandonne pas l'ordonnance de leur Dieu, ils me demandent les ordonnances de la justice; ils prennent plaisir à s'approcher de Dieu.\n3 Pourquoi avons-nous jeûné, disent-ils, et tu ne le vois pas ? Pourquoi avons-nous affligé notre âme, et tu n'en sais rien ? Voici, le jour de votre jeûne, vous trouvez du plaisir et vous exigez tous vos travaux .  **\nLorsque vous comprenez que quelqu'un est un pécheur, qu'il s'agisse d'un membre de la famille, d'un ami, d'un collègue ou de quelqu'un de votre congrégation, parlez-lui de son état et de la solution   Jésus, l'Agneau de Dieu, qui enlève le péché du monde . Tu ne souffriras pas de péché sur ton frère. Reprenez-le, afin qu'il se repente, par la grâce de Dieu. Prêchez-leur la Parole et présentez Jésus comme Philippe l'a fait. Le message est le salut en Jésus par le pardon en Son nom seul.  **\nLuc 24 verset 47   **\n47 Et que la repentance et la rémission des péchés soient prêchées en son nom parmi toutes les nations, à commencer par Jérusalem.  **\nVous êtes un témoin du Seigneur, alors allez prêcher en son nom et dites aux gens de croire au nom de Jésus. Si vous avez l'occasion de prêcher dans certaines de ces églises incrédules, alors n'hésitez pas. Dites-leur de se repentir et de venir à Jésus.  **\n\n\nPARTIE   **\nLE PÉCHÉ CHEZ LES AUTRES DEVRAIT ATTIRER LES MÉTHODES DE GAIN D'ÂME   **\nNe le faites pas grossièrement pour les faire fuir, vous résister ou provoquer la persécution.  **\nProverbes 11 verset 30   **\n30 Le fruit du juste est un arbre de vie; et celui qui gagne des âmes est sage.  **\nPour gagner une âme, il faut être sage. Vous devez agir avec sagesse. Comment Abigaïl a-t-elle condamné Nabal , un imbécile, un homme endurci ? Elle ne parlait pas à son mari quand il était ivre. Elle attendit que le pouvoir de l'alcool l'ait quitté. Puis elle l'affronta avec sagesse et humilité. Comment Nathan lui a-t-il présenté le péché de David ? Le Seigneur l'envoya vers David pour le reprendre pour son iniquité. Nathan est allé avec une parabole. Il a donné à David une chance de juger la question. Quel était le problème? Un homme avait une brebis qu'il aimait comme une fille et son voisin avait des milliers de brebis. Mais quand il avait un visiteur, au lieu de prendre de ses nombreux moutons, il enlevait le seul mouton de l'homme pour divertir son visiteur.\nDavid, après avoir entendu cette histoire, a rapidement jugé la question. Alors Nathan a dit, tu es l'homme. De quelle manière ? Urie n'avait qu'une seule femme, et toi plusieurs. David a été condamné et il a avoué son péché à Dieu   « C'est contre toi que j'ai péché et j'ai fait ce mal.\nVous voyez, il a fallu de la sagesse pour l'amener à ce point. Selon la personne avec qui vous partagez l'évangile, vous devez utiliser différentes méthodes ou approches, en tenant compte des circonstances et de l'environnement qui prévalent. Nous pouvons utiliser bien d'autres moyens pour gagner les perdus à Christ. Vous pouvez décider d'écrire des lettres à certains d'entre eux. Pour d'autres, vous pouvez organiser une fête pour leur prêcher et leur donner de la documentation sur l'Évangile.  **\nJacques 1 verset 5   **\n5 Si l'un de vous manque de sagesse, qu'il la demande à Dieu, qui donne à tous simplement et sans reproche ; et il lui sera donné.  **\nLa sagesse est la chose principale pour gagner des âmes. Demandez à Dieu de vous aider et de vous montrer ce que vous pouvez faire. Demandez-lui les méthodes qui peuvent varier d'une personne à l'autre. Obtenez la sagesse; avec tout ce que vous obtenez, obtenez la compréhension.  **\nProverbes 4 verset 7   **\n7 La sagesse est la chose principale ; acquiers donc la sagesse, et avec tout ce que tu as acquis, acquiers l'intelligence.  **\n\n\n\nPARTIE VINGT   **\nLE PÉCHÉ CHEZ LES AUTRES DEVRAIT VOUS FAIRE DÉPENSER POUR LEUR SALUT   **\nDépensez pour leur salut.  **\nLuc 10 verset 30 à 35   **\n30 Et Jésus, répondant, dit   Un homme est descendu de Jérusalem à Jéricho, et est tombé parmi des voleurs, qui l'ont dépouillé de ses vêtements, et l'ont blessé, et sont partis, le laissant à moitié mort.\n31 Et par hasard un certain sacrificateur descendit par là, et quand il le vit, il passa de l'autre côté. 32 Et de même un Lévite, lorsqu'il était à cet endroit, vint, le regarda, et passa de l'autre côté.\n33 Mais un certain Samaritain, pendant qu'il voyageait, vint où il était; et quand il le vit, il eut pitié de lui,\n34 Et il alla vers lui, pansa ses blessures, versa de l'huile et du vin, et le mit sur sa propre bête, et le conduisit dans une auberge, et prit soin de lui.\n35 Et le lendemain, quand il partit, il sortit deux deniers, et les donna à l'hôte, et lui dit   Prends soin de lui ; et tout ce que tu dépenseras de plus, quand je reviendrai, je te le rendrai.  **\nVoir un homme dans le besoin. Cet homme ne l'a jamais connu auparavant. Mais quand il le vit dans la condition qui exigeait le salut, il fit tout pour apporter le salut à l'homme. Il l'a porté sur son âne jusqu'à une auberge, a payé son traitement, a laissé de l'argent à l'aubergiste et a ensuite promis de revenir et de s'occuper de toute autre dépense supplémentaire. Il n'a jamais dit à l'aubergiste qu'il ne connaissait pas l'homme. Certaines façons que nous pouvons dépenser pour le salut des non-sauvés sont de les inviter à nos réunions chrétiennes, mais assurez-vous de couvrir toutes leurs dépenses financières. Achetez du matériel de l'Évangile comme des vidéos, des CD, des livres, des cassettes, un téléphone, etc., et offrez-les. Dépensez pour eux. Jésus a tout donné pour nous sauver. Ne devrions-nous pas aussi dépenser pour sauver les autres ? C'est ce que Dieu attend de nous.  **\nEsaïe 55 verset 1 à 2   **\n1 Quiconque a soif , venez aux eaux, et celui qui n'a pas d'argent; venez, achetez et mangez; oui, venez acheter du vin et du lait sans argent et sans prix.\n2 Pourquoi dépensez-vous de l'argent pour ce qui n'est pas du pain ? et votre travail pour ce qui ne satisfait pas? écoutez-moi attentivement, et mangez ce qui est bon, et laissez votre âme se délecter de graisse.  **\nEn tant que chrétiens, nous devons aider à faciliter le salut des âmes de la mort éternelle avec nos ressources. Pourquoi gaspiller des ressources sur des choses qui n'ont pas de valeur éternelle mais ne peuvent pas investir pour gagner des âmes ?  **\n\nPARTIE VINGT ET UN   **\nLE PÉCHÉ CHEZ LES AUTRES DEVRAIT VOUS FAIRE MÉPRISER LA PERSÉCUTION POUR LEUR SALUT   **\nJésus a embrassé la persécution pour notre salut. En tant que ses disciples, nous devons l'imiter et ne pas fuir la souffrance, les attaques et la persécution pour le salut des autres. Que cette vie soit en vous, qui était en Jésus-Christ.  **\nZacharie 13 verset 6   **\n6 Et on lui dira   Quelles sont ces blessures dans tes mains ? Alors il répondra   Ceux avec lesquels j'ai été blessé dans la maison de mes amis.  **\n« Ils m'ont cloué sur la croix quand je suis allé sauver mes amis. Ce sont les blessures.  **\nEsaïe 53 verset 1 à 6   **\n1Qui a cru notre rapport? Et à qui le bras du Seigneur est-il révélé ?\n2 Car il poussera devant lui comme une plante tendre, et comme une racine d'un sol sec, il n'a ni forme ni beauté ; et quand nous le verrons, il n'y a pas de beauté pour que nous le désirions.\n3 Il est méprisé et rejeté des hommes ; un homme de douleur et habitué à la douleur, et nous Lui avons comme caché nos visages; Il était méprisé et nous ne l'estimions pas. 4 Assurément , il a porté nos peines et porté nos peines ; pourtant nous l'avons estimé frappé, frappé par Dieu et affligé.\n5 Mais il a été blessé pour nos transgressions, il a été meurtri pour nos iniquités, le châtiment de notre paix était sur lui ; et avec ses meurtrissures nous sommes guéris.\n6 Tous ceux que nous aimons comme des brebis se sont égarés; nous nous sommes tournés chacun vers sa propre voie ; et le Seigneur a fait retomber sur lui l'iniquité de nous tous.  **\nCe qu'il a souffert, nous devrions pouvoir le souffrir. «Ce sont les blessures que j'ai protégées quand je suis venu au monde pour sauver les pécheurs; maintenant nous sommes amis. je ne vous appelle plus serviteurs; maintenant, vous êtes mes amis.  **\nJean 20 verset 19 à 20   **\n19 Alors le même jour, le soir, étant le premier jour de la semaine, quand les portes où les disciples étaient assemblés par crainte des Juifs étaient fermées, Jésus vint et se tint au milieu, et leur dit   Que la paix soit avec vous.\n20 Et quand il eut dit cela, il leur montra ses mains et son côté. Alors les disciples furent dans la joie lorsqu'ils virent le Seigneur.  **\nRemarquez que Jésus a montré à ses disciples les cicatrices des blessures. De même, nous sommes appelés à souffrir à cause de son nom, même jusqu'à la persécution.  **\nActes 20 verset 21 à 25   **\n21 Témoignant tant aux Juifs qu'aux Grecs, la repentance envers Dieu, et la foi envers notre Seigneur Jésus Christ.\n22 Et maintenant, voici, je vais lié par l'esprit à Jérusalem, ne sachant pas ce qui m'y arrivera.\n23 Sauf que le Saint-Esprit témoigne dans chaque ville, disant que les liens et les afflictions me supportent.\n24 Mais aucune de ces choses ne m'émeut, et je ne considère pas ma vie comme chère à moi-même, afin que je puisse terminer ma course avec joie, et le ministère que j'ai reçu du Seigneur Jésus, pour témoigner l'évangile de la grâce de Dieu. .\n25 Et maintenant, voici, je sais que vous tous, au milieu desquels je suis allé prêcher le royaume de Dieu, vous ne verrez plus ma face.  **\nPaul n'était pas très concerné par ce qui lui arriverait à Jérusalem tant qu'il pourrait témoigner de l'évangile de la grâce de Dieu et prêcher le royaume de Dieu. Jésus a dit   **\nLuc 21 verset 11 à 14   **\n11 Et il y aura de grands tremblements de terre en divers lieux, et des famines, et des pestes ; et il y aura des spectacles effrayants et de grands signes du ciel.\n12 Mais devant tous ceux-ci, ils mettront la main sur vous et vous persécuteront, vous livrant aux synagogues et dans des prisons, étant amenés devant des rois et des chefs à cause de mon nom. 13 Et cela vous reviendra en témoignage.\n14 Mettez-le donc dans vos cœurs, de ne pas méditer avant ce que vous répondrez ;   **\nFrère, que la volonté de Dieu sur ta vie soit faite. Vous devez aller après les âmes des hommes, des femmes, des jeunes et des vieux.  **\n\nCONCLUSION   **\nMaintenant, vous savez ce que le Seigneur vous commande concernant le péché. Vous savez quoi faire au sujet du péché en vous et quoi faire au sujet du péché chez les autres. Savoir ne suffit pas. Vous avez besoin de la puissance du Saint-Esprit pour obéir. Vous ne pouvez pas le faire avec votre force.  **\nZacharie 4 verset 6   **\n6 Alors il répondit et me parla , disant   C'est ici la parole de l'Éternel à Zorobabel, disant   Ni par la force, ni par la puissance, mais par mon Esprit, dit l'Éternel des armées.  **\nAvec la puissance de Dieu, vous pouvez vivre une vie sainte et juste, sans péché.  **\nPhilippiens 4 verset 13   **\n13 Je puis tout par Christ qui me fortifie . Ce qui est requis, c'est que vous croyiez.  **\nMatthieu 17 verset 20   **\n20 Et Jésus leur dit   A cause de votre incrédulité ; car en vérité, je vous le dis, si vous avez la foi comme un grain de sénevé, vous direz à cette montagne   Éloignez-vous d'ici là-bas ; et il enlèvera; et rien ne vous sera impossible.  **\nPourquoi demander à Dieu de la nourriture, des vêtements, un abri, une promotion, la guérison et tout le reste, mais pas le pouvoir d'être saint, juste et exempt de péché ?  **\n Matthieu 7 verset 8 à 11   **\n8 Pour quiconque demande reçoit ; et celui qui cherche trouve ; et à celui qui frappe, on lui ouvrira.\n9 Ou quel est l'homme d'entre vous qui, si son fils demande du pain, lui donnera-t-il une pierre ?\n10 Ou s'il demande un poisson, lui donnera-t-il un serpent ?\n11 Si donc vous, étant méchants, savez donner de bonnes choses à vos enfants, combien plus votre Père qui est dans les cieux donnera-t-il de bonnes choses à ceux qui le lui demandent ?  **\nDemandez par la foi, et recevez par la foi, marchez par la foi, et vous vivrez sans péché, et la puissance de Dieu se manifestera dans votre vie pour sauver les autres au Nom de Jésus, Amen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "EXHORTATION A LA FOI EN DIEU\nET PATIENCE DANS VOTRE SITUATION   **\nExhortation à la foi en Dieu et à la patience\nDans Votre Situation   **\n\n\nPRÉSENTATION   **\nHébreux 6 verset 12 à 15   **\n12\tQue vous ne soyez pas paresseux, mais que vous suiviez ceux qui, par la foi et la patience, héritent des promesses.\n13\tCar lorsque Dieu fit la promesse à Abraham, parce qu'il ne pouvait jurer par plus grand, il jura par lui-même,\n14\tDisant   Certainement , en bénissant, je te bénirai, et en multipliant, je te multiplierai.\n15\tEt ainsi, après avoir patiemment enduré, il obtint la promesse.\n16\tCar les hommes jurent en vérité par le plus grand et un serment de confirmation est pour eux la fin de tout conflit.  **\nLa foi est une confiance totale en Dieu et en sa parole. La foi signifie aussi une obéissance totale à Dieu et à sa parole. La foi croit que ce que Dieu dit arrivera. La foi croit que ce que Dieu dit n'arrivera pas ou cessera d'arriver. La foi croit que ce que Dieu a promis de donner sera donné ; ce que Dieu promet de faire sera fait. La foi croit que la parole de Dieu est vraie.\nPar conséquent, croyez ce que Dieu vous promet. Priez selon Sa volonté et sachez que vous aurez la réponse.   **\nPremier Jean 5 verset 14 à 15   **\n14\tEt c'est la confiance que nous avons en lui, que si nous demandons quelque chose selon sa volonté, il nous écoute.\n15\tEt si nous savons qu'il nous entend , quoi que nous demandions, nous savons que nous avons les requêtes que nous lui avons demandées.\nLes Écritures nous montrent que la foi a un temps d'accomplissement qui varie de « Dès que vous avez cru » à « Plusieurs années après avoir cru en Dieu ».   **\n\nGenèse 18 verset 14   **\n« Y a-t -il quelque chose de trop difficile pour le Seigneur ? Au temps fixé, je reviendrai vers toi, selon le temps de la vie, et Sarah aura un fils.  **\nComme il y a du temps pour tout, même ainsi, la foi a aussi un temps d'accomplissement qui est dans la puissance de Dieu.   **\nEcclésiaste 3 verset 1   **\n« Il y a un temps pour toute chose , et un temps pour toute chose sous le ciel »   **\nActes 1 verset 7   **\n\"Et il leur dit  Ce n'est pas à vous de connaître les temps ou les saisons que le Père a mis en son pouvoir.\"  **\nParce que ce pour quoi vous croyez Dieu peut ne pas arriver immédiatement, et ce que vous demandez à Dieu peut ne pas vous être accordé immédiatement, la Bible vous dit d'accompagner votre foi avec patience, comme l'a fait Abraham. La patience est la capacité d'attendre Dieu ou d'attendre Dieu paisiblement jusqu'à ce que son temps vienne.   **\nHébreux 6 verset 15.  **\n\"Et ainsi, après avoir patiemment enduré, il obtint la promesse.\"  **\n\nPsaumes 145 verset 15    **\n« Les yeux de tous attendent sur toi ; et tu leur donnes leur nourriture en temps voulu.  **\nPsaumes 40 verset 1 à 2   **\n1\tJ'ai attendu patiemment le Seigneur; et il s'inclina vers moi, et entendit mon cri.\n2\tIl m'a aussi fait sortir d' une fosse horrible, de l'argile fangeuse, et a posé mes pieds sur un rocher, et a établi mes allées.\nSi vous ne faites pas preuve de patience devant Dieu, votre cœur entrera dans le doute et votre foi sera avortée. Ayez un cœur fixé devant Dieu sur ce que vous avez cru qu'il faisait pour vous, sans vous soucier du temps que cela prend, tant que vous avez demandé selon sa volonté.  **\n\nJacques 1 verset 6 à 8   **\n6\tMais laisse-le questionner en confiance, sans l'agiter. Car celui qui vacille est comme une vague de la mer poussée par le vent et agitée.\n7\tCar que cet homme ne pense pas qu'il recevra quelque chose du Seigneur.\n8\tUn homme irrésolu est instable dans toutes ses voies.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 1      **\nFOI ET PATIENCE    **\n1.1\tLa combinaison de la foi et de la patience    **\n\nHébreux. 6 versets 10 à 15    **\n10 Car Dieu n'est pas injuste d'oublier votre travail et votre travail d'amour, que vous avez montrés envers son nom, en ce que vous avez servi les saints, et que vous faites le service.\n11 Et nous désirons que chacun de vous montre la même diligence à la pleine assurance de l'espérance jusqu'à la fin  \n12 afin que vous ne soyez pas paresseux, mais que vous suiviez ceux qui, par la foi et la patience, héritent des promesses.\n13 Car lorsque Dieu fit la promesse à Abraham, parce qu'il ne pouvait jurer par un plus grand, il jura par lui-même,\n14 Disant   Certainement , en bénissant, je te bénirai, et en multipliant, je te multiplierai.\n15 Et ainsi, après avoir patiemment enduré, il obtint la promesse.  **\n\nLes enfants de Dieu sont des gens de foi ; ce sont aussi des gens de patience. Par conséquent, assurez-vous de marquer et d'observer ces deux choses dans votre vie   la foi et la patience. Ne marchez pas seulement par la foi, marchez aussi avec patience. L'œil droit est la foi tandis que l'œil gauche est la patience - Il vous a donné les deux yeux et cela vous donne l'équilibre de la vue. La main droite est la foi tandis que la main gauche est la patience, vous donnant l'équilibre du mouvement. Le pied droit est la foi tandis que le pied gauche est la patience, alors, vous pouvez couvrir une longue distance. Si vous utilisez la foi seule (un pied), vous sauterez. Combien de temps pouvez-vous sauter avec un pied ? Vous finirez par tomber. C'est pourquoi Dieu vous dit de ne pas vous laisser tomber, mais de continuer jusqu'à la fin. La race humaine est née par deux genres   l'homme et la femme (foi et patience) et c'est ainsi que le monde entier est rempli d'humanité.   **\n\n1.2\tExemple du Père de la Foi   **\nDieu nous a donné l'exemple d'Abraham, l'homme que Dieu a choisi, qui a démontré la vie de foi et de patience devant Dieu. Dieu a traité avec lui dans ces deux domaines   Foi et Patience. Dieu a fait une promesse à Abraham et il a cru Dieu. A cause de sa foi, il a obtenu le titre, 'L'Ami de Dieu'. Par sa patience, il put attendre 25 ans pour recevoir l'enfant promis.   **\n\nJacques 2 verset 23    **\n« Et s'accomplit l'Écriture qui dit   Abraham crut à Dieu, et cela lui fut imputé à justice, et il fut appelé l'ami de Dieu. \"   **\n\nRomains 4 verset 17 à 22   **\n17 (Comme il est écrit, je t'ai établi père d'une multitude de nations), devant celui en qui il a cru, oui Dieu, qui vivifie les morts et appelle comme si elles étaient ce qui n'est pas.\n18 Celui qui, contre toute espérance, a cru en l'espérance, afin de devenir le père d'une multitude de nations, selon ce qui a été dit, Ainsi sera ta postérité.\n19 Et n'étant pas faible dans la foi, il ne considéra pas son propre corps maintenant mort, alors qu'il avait environ cent ans, ni encore la mort du ventre de Sara ;\n20 Il n'a pas chancelé à la promesse de Dieu par incrédulité; mais était fort dans la foi, rendant gloire à Dieu;\n21 Et étant pleinement persuadé que ce qu'il avait promis, il pouvait aussi l'accomplir.\n22 Et c'est pourquoi cela lui fut imputé à justice. Ces deux choses sont importantes pour vous permettre de marcher avec Dieu jusqu'à l'éternité. Ils vous aident à entrer au ciel. La distance est longue, mais les deux pieds (la foi et la patience) pourront vous conduire au paradis.   **\nJames. 5 verset 7, 8    **\n7 Soyez donc patients, frères, jusqu'à la venue du Seigneur. Voici, le laboureur attend le précieux fruit de la terre, et a une longue patience pour cela, jusqu'à ce qu'il reçoive la pluie de la première et de l'arrière-saison.\n8 Soyez aussi patients; affermissez vos coeurs, car la venue du Seigneur est proche.   **\n\nHébreux 10 verset 36 à 39   **\n36 Car vous avez besoin de patience, afin qu'après avoir fait la volonté de Dieu, vous receviez la promesse.\n37 Car encore un peu de temps, et celui qui doit venir viendra, et ne tardera pas.\n38 Le juste vivra par la foi, mais si quelqu'un recule , mon âme n'aura pas de plaisir en lui.\n39 Mais nous ne sommes pas de ceux qui reculent vers la perdition ; mais de ceux qui croient au salut de l'âme.  **\n1.3\tAyez foi en Dieu    **\n Marquer. 11 verset 22 à 24   **\n22 Et Jésus, répondant, leur dit   Ayez foi en Dieu.\n23 Car en vérité, je vous dis que quiconque dira à cette montagne   Déplace- toi, et sois jeté dans la mer ; et ne doutera pas dans son coeur, mais croira que les choses qu'il dit arriveront; il aura tout ce qu'il dira.\n24 C'est pourquoi je vous dis, quelles que soient les choses que vous désirez, quand vous priez, croyez que vous les recevez, et vous les aurez.  **\nLa foi en Dieu est la chose principale. 'Et ne doutera pas dans son cœur…', montre qu'il y a un temps de foi. Cela peut ne pas se matérialiser immédiatement. Il y a une disposition pour le test; vas-tu patienter ? Allez-vous être patient jusqu'à ce qu'il se matérialise ou douterez-vous et deviendrez-vous paresseux en chemin ? Allez-vous jeter la confiance sur le chemin?  **\n'Quiconque dira à cette montagne…', dites-le, mais il y aura un espace de temps (les temps et les saisons dans la main de Dieu) pour la matérialisation. C'est ce temps que le diable voudra mettre à profit pour faire avorter la foi en vous faisant douter. Ne doutez pas car cela prend du temps.  **\nSaul, Samuel arrive. Ne vous précipitez pas pour aller faire le sacrifice car vous n'êtes pas prêtre. Attendez Samuel ! Celui qui se hâte avec ses pieds pèche (Proverbes. 19 verset 2). Être patient! Si ce n'est pas encore fait, rappelez-vous que vous n'avez pas qu'un seul œil, l'autre œil (la patience) est là pour un équilibre.\n« Il lui sera fait… », au moment et à la saison appropriés de la foi.  **\nAu verset 24, entre les phrases « vous les recevez » et « vous les aurez », il y a un espace de temps qui est entre les mains du Seigneur et qui demande de la patience. C'est un temps d'attente et de confiance que Dieu ne faillira pas.   **\nHébreux 10 verset 35 à 38   **\n35 Ne rejetez donc pas votre confiance, qui a une grande récompense de récompense.\n36 Car vous avez besoin de patience, afin qu'après avoir fait la volonté de Dieu, vous receviez la promesse.\n37 Car encore un peu de temps, et celui qui doit venir viendra, et ne tardera pas.\n38 Le juste vivra par la foi, mais si quelqu'un recule , mon âme n'aura pas de plaisir en lui.  **\n1.4\tAvec Dieu tout est possible    **\nMarc 10 verset 27   **\n« Et Jésus, les regardant, dit   Aux hommes c'est impossible, mais pas à Dieu, car à Dieu tout est possible. \"\nPouvez-vous voir qu'avec Dieu TOUT peut être fait ?   **\n\nMarquer. 9 verset 23   **\n« Jésus lui dit   Si tu peux croire, tout est possible à celui qui croit. »  **\nCroire, c'est avoir foi en Dieu. Montez dans le royaume de Dieu et pensez à Ses pensées. Remettez cette affaire à Dieu parce que cela peut être fait. Remettez ce problème à Dieu et commencez à le voir et à l'aborder comme Dieu le voit et l'aborde. Pensez-y comme Dieu le pense. Parlez du sujet comme Dieu parle, c'est la foi.\n'Et cela sera fait…' parce que vous l'avez remis à Dieu et qu'il est maintenant dans Son royaume. Puisqu'à Dieu tout est possible et que vous avez cru, tout vous sera possible.   **\nMarquer. 5 verset 35 à 36   **\nparlait encore , il vint du chef de la maison de la synagogue quelqu'un qui dit   Ta fille est morte, pourquoi troubler encore le maître ?\n36 Dès que Jésus eut entendu la parole qui avait été dite, il dit au chef de la synagogue   N'aie pas peur, crois seulement.  **\nLuc. 8 verset 49 à 55   **\n49 Comme il parlait encore , quelqu'un vient du chef de la maison de la synagogue, et lui dit   Ta fille est morte ; trouble pas le Maître.\n50 Mais Jésus, l'ayant entendu, lui répondit, disant   Ne crains pas, crois seulement, et elle sera guérie.\n51 Et lorsqu'il entra dans la maison, il ne laissa entrer personne d'autre que Pierre, Jacques et Jean, et le père et la mère de la jeune fille.\n52 Et tous pleurèrent et la lamentèrent ; mais Il dit   Ne pleure pas ; elle n'est pas morte, mais elle dort .\n53 Et ils se moquaient de lui, sachant qu'elle était morte.\n54 Et il les fit tous sortir, et la prit par la main, et appela, disant   Pucelle, lève-toi.\n55 Et son esprit revint, et elle se leva aussitôt, et il ordonna de lui donner de la nourriture.  **\nPsaumes 37 verset 4 à 5    **\nPrends aussi plaisir à l'Éternel; et il te donnera les désirs de ton coeur.\nRecommande ta voie à l'Éternel; ayez aussi confiance en Lui; et Il l'accomplira.  **\n\n\n\n\nCHAPITRE 2    **\nLA PUISSANCE DANS LA FOI    **\n\n2.1 Ce que la foi peut faire pour vous   **\nUne confiance ou confiance en Dieu par la foi peut vous donner ce qui suit    **\n\n2.1.1 La foi peut vous y conduire   **\n\nVoulez-vous aller quelque part ? La foi en Dieu peut vous y conduire. Il peut être difficile pour les gens d'arriver à cette destination, mais vous y arriverez parce que vous avez confié la question à Dieu. Il sera celui qui prendra le relais. S'il s'agit de vous faire traverser la mer, Il asséchera la mer et vous traverserez. Tant que vous avez cru en Dieu, la question est dans Son royaume et Il vous y conduira. Les montagnes qui peuvent être sur le chemin seront roulées par le Seigneur parce que tu Lui as tout remis. Il s'occupera des vallées et des garnisons des sorcières et sorciers. Il s'occupera également des démons sur le chemin et vous atteindrez la destination.   **\n\nEsdras 8 verset 21 à 23, 31, 32   **\n21 Alors j'ai proclamé un jeûne là, au fleuve d' Ahava , afin que nous puissions nous affliger devant notre Dieu, pour lui demander une voie droite pour nous, et pour nos petits, et pour tout notre bien.\n22 Car j'avais honte d'exiger du roi une troupe de soldats et de cavaliers pour nous aider contre l'ennemi en chemin , parce que nous avions parlé au roi, disant   La main de notre Dieu est sur tous ceux qui cherchent le bien. Lui; mais sa puissance et sa colère sont contre tous ceux qui l'abandonnent. 23 Nous avons donc jeûné et prié notre Dieu pour cela, et il nous a suppliés. 31 Alors nous quittâmes le fleuve d' Ahava le douzième jour du premier mois, pour aller à Jérusalem, et la main de notre Dieu était sur nous, et il nous délivra de la main de l'ennemi et de ceux qui nous guettaient. d'ailleurs.\n32 Et nous arrivâmes à Jérusalem, et nous y demeurâmes trois jours. Les vents et la mer lui obéiront dans votre voyage avec Jésus vers les destinations souhaitées.  **\n\nMatthieu 8 verset 18, 23 à 27   **\nMaintenant, quand Jésus a vu de grandes multitudes autour de lui, il a donné l'ordre de s'en aller de l'autre côté.\n23 Et lorsqu'il fut monté dans une barque, ses disciples le suivirent.\n24 Et voici, il s'éleva une grande tempête sur la mer, de sorte que le navire fut couvert de vagues , mais il dormait.\n25 Et ses disciples s'approchèrent de lui, et le réveillèrent, disant   Seigneur, sauve-nous, nous périssons.\n26 Et il leur dit   Pourquoi avez-vous peur, hommes de peu de foi ? Alors il se leva, et menaça les vents et la mer ; et il y eut un grand calme.\n27 Mais les hommes s'étonnaient , disant   Quel est cet homme, que même les vents et la mer lui obéissent !  **\n\n2.1.2 La foi peut vous le donner    **\n\nVous pouvez l'obtenir, vous pouvez réaliser et posséder ce que vous désirez, parce que Dieu peut vous le donner. Son pouvoir peut vous le donner. Sa sagesse peut vous le donner. Donc, puisque vous avez cru, la foi en lui vous le donnera.   **\n\nGenèse 18 verset 9 à 14   **\n9 Et ils lui dirent   Où est Sara, ta femme ? Et il dit  Voici, dans la tente.\n10Et il dit  Je reviendrai certainement vers toi selon le temps de la vie; et voici, Sara, ta femme, aura un fils. Et Sara l'entendit à l'entrée de la tente, qui était derrière lui.\n11 Or Abraham et Sara étaient vieux et bien âgés ; et il cessa d'être avec Sara à la manière des femmes.\n12 C'est pourquoi Sara rit en elle-même, disant   Quand je serai vieillie, aurai-je du plaisir, mon seigneur étant aussi vieux ?\n13 Et l'Éternel dit à Abraham   Pourquoi Sara a-t-elle ri, en disant   Dois-je, à coup sûr, enfanter un enfant qui est vieux ?\n14 Y a-t-il quelque chose de trop dur pour l'Éternel ? Au temps fixé, je reviendrai vers toi, selon le temps de la vie, et Sarah aura un fils.  **\n\nLa foi peut vous donner la victoire. Vous vaincrez dans cette affaire; vous surmonterez cette personne et ses pièges parce que vous croyez en Dieu. Vous vaincrez dans cette bataille parce que c'est Dieu qui la combattra pour vous. Dieu sera celui qui vous défendra et vous guidera, par conséquent, vous gagnerez vos opposants.   **\n\nPremier Jean 4 verset 4  **\n« Vous êtes de Dieu, petits enfants, et vous les avez vaincus, car celui qui est en vous est plus grand que celui qui est dans le monde. \"  **\n\n\nPremier Jean 5 verset 4 et 5   **\n4Car tout ce qui est né de Dieu triomphe du monde, et c'est la victoire qui triomphe du monde, c'est-à-dire notre foi.\n5 Qui est celui qui vaincra le monde, sinon celui qui croit que Jésus est le Fils de Dieu ? Tout cela arrivera, parce que vous avez foi en Dieu. **\n6 Ayez foi en Dieu ! Croyez que Dieu le fera pour vous et vous aurez la victoire.  **\nDaniel. 6 verset 16, 19 à 23   **\nAlors le roi commanda, et ils amenèrent Daniel, et le jetèrent dans la fosse aux lions. Or le roi prit la parole et dit à Daniel   Ton Dieu que tu sers continuellement, il te délivrera.\n19 Alors le roi se leva de grand matin, et se rendit en hâte à la fosse aux lions.\n20 Et lorsqu'il arriva dans la fosse, il cria d'une voix lamentable à Daniel, et le roi parla et dit à Daniel   Ô Daniel, serviteur du Dieu vivant, ton Dieu, que tu sers continuellement, est capable de te délivrer de les Lions?\n21 Alors Daniel dit au roi   Ô roi, vis éternellement.\n22 Mon Dieu a envoyé son ange, et a fermé la gueule des lions, afin qu'ils ne me fassent pas de mal ; car avant lui l'innocence a été trouvée en moi; et aussi devant toi, ô roi, je n'ai fait aucun mal.\n23 Alors le roi se réjouit à son égard, et ordonna de faire sortir Daniel de la fosse. Ainsi Daniel fut tiré hors de la fosse, et aucune sorte de mal ne fut trouvé sur lui, parce qu'il croyait en son Dieu.  **\n\n2.1.3 La foi peut garder votre cœur paisible   **\n\nEsaïe 26 verset 1 à 4   **\n1 En ce jour-là, ce cantique sera chanté dans le pays de Juda; Nous avons une ville forte; le salut que Dieu désignera pour les murs et les remparts.\n2Ouvrez les portes, afin qu'entre la nation juste qui garde la verite.\n3Tu garderas dans une paix parfaite celui dont l'esprit s'est attaché à toi, parce qu'il se confie en toi.\n4 Confiez-vous en l'Éternel pour toujours ; car dans le SEIGNEUR JÉHOVAH est la force éternelle   **\n\n La foi gardera votre cœur paisible en présence d'un danger, car c'est Dieu qui maintient une personne paisible. Lorsque le navire était sur la mer et qu'un vent violent soufflait fort dessus, comme pour le couler, Jésus dormait dans la partie inférieure du navire. Ayez foi en Dieu qui est avec vous dans ce sommeil. Qu'est-ce qui peut émouvoir Dieu ? Qu'est-ce qui peut gagner sur Lui ? Qu'est-ce qui peut le vaincre, le frustrer ou le tuer ? Alors, rejoignez-le là-haut (au lieu de la foi). Remettez-lui l'affaire là-bas, vous serez en paix.\n\nQuand les disciples criaient et criaient et disaient   « Maître, ne te soucies -tu pas que nous périssions ? Il se serait demandé ainsi   « Comment pouvez-vous périr ? Vous n'avez pas cru Dieu? Ne sais-tu pas que tu vas quelque part avec Dieu ? Vous partez avec Dieu pour l'éternité, le ciel. Vous allez avec Dieu à l'accomplissement d'une mission dans cette vie, alors Il ne vous abandonnera pas en chemin. Au contraire, il vous verra à travers toutes les difficultés de la vie. Par conséquent, ayez foi en Dieu et vous serez en paix.   **\n\nPsaume. 119 verset 165   **\n\"Une grande paix a ceux qui aiment ta loi et rien ne les offensera.\"  **\n\nEsaïe 26 verset 3   **\n« Tu garderas dans une paix parfaite celui dont l'esprit est fixé sur toi ; parce qu'il se confie en toi. Par conséquent, ayez confiance en lui.  **\n\nDeutéronome 31 verset 6,8   **\n6\tSoyez forts et d'un bon courage, ne les craignez pas, n'ayez pas peur d'eux ; car c'est l'Éternel, ton Dieu, qui va avec toi; Il ne te manquera pas, ni ne t'abandonnera.\n7\tEt l'Éternel, c'est lui qui marche devant toi; Il sera avec toi, Il ne te manquera pas, ne t'abandonnera pas , ne crains pas, ne t'effraie pas.  **\n\n2.1.4 La foi vous donnera la guérison   **\n\nJérémie 33 verset 6   **\nVoici, je lui apporterai la santé et la guérison, et je les guérirai, et je leur révélerai l'abondance de la paix et de la vérité.  **\n\nJérémie 17 verset 14   **\nGuéris-moi, ô Éternel, et je serai guéri; sauve-moi, et je serai sauvé ; car tu es ma louange.  **\n\nJérémie 30 verset 17   **\nCar je te rendrai la santé, et je te guérirai de tes blessures, dit l'Éternel; parce qu'ils t'ont appelé un proscrit, disant   c'est Sion, que personne ne recherche .  **\n\n La foi en Dieu vous guérira parce que Dieu est un guérisseur. Il guérit Son peuple. La guérison est le pain des enfants. Dieu vous guérira parce que le juste vivra par la foi en Dieu et donc tout est rendu possible pour le juste. Quelle que soit la force ou la difficulté de l'affaire, la foi vous apportera la guérison et la victoire.\n\nEn fait, en raison de la production de nombreuses alternatives de guérison par le monde, il y a eu un ralentissement du rythme de la foi dans le monde. Beaucoup de gens ne croient plus en Dieu. Cette réduction du niveau de foi est arrivée au point que beaucoup en sont venus à convenir que certaines maladies ne peuvent pas être guéries. De nombreux chrétiens conviennent maintenant que certains cas ne peuvent être gérés, sans guérison permanente. Ainsi, nous laissons Dieu seul. Nous ne prenons pas la peine de Lui demander de nous guérir. Lorsque de telles maladies surviennent, nous disons   'Dieu, cette maladie est venue, mais je ne prendrai pas la peine de vous en parler parce que je sais qu'il n'y a pas de solution à cela.' Est-ce en face de Dieu que vous dites une telle chose ? Revivons ! Dieu est un guérisseur et Il guérit toutes les maladies et maladies. 'Bénissez le Seigneur, ô mon âme… qui guérit toutes tes maladies' (Palms. 103 versets 1 à 3). Ramenons donc ces maladies à Dieu. Revivons, Dieu est toujours vivant ! Il enlèvera toutes sortes de maladies et toutes sortes de maladies et par la foi, cela sera fait dans votre vie !   **\n\nExode 15 verset 26\nEt dit   si tu écoutes attentivement la voix de l'Éternel, ton Dieu, et que tu fasses ce qui est droit à ses yeux, et que tu prêtes l'oreille à ses commandements, et que tu gardes toutes ses statues, je ne mettrai aucune de ces maladies sur toi. toi, que j'ai fait venir sur les Égyptiens; car je suis l'Éternel qui te guérit .   **\n\nDeutéronome. 7 verset 14,15  **\n14 Tu seras béni plus que tout le monde, il n'y aura ni mâle ni femelle stérile parmi toi, ni parmi ton bétail.\n15. Et l'Éternel éloignera de toi toute maladie, et ne mettra sur toi aucune des mauvaises maladies d'Égypte que tu connais ; mais je les imposerai à tous ceux qui te haïssent.  **\nMatthieu 8 versets 1 à 3    **\n1 Lorsqu'il fut descendu de la montagne, de grandes foules le suivirent.\n2 Et voici, un lépreux vint et se prosterna devant lui, en disant   Seigneur, si tu le veux, tu peux me rendre pur.\n3 Et Jésus étendit la main, et le toucha, disant   Je veux ; sois pur. Et aussitôt sa lèpre fut purifiée.   **\n2.1.5 La foi vous donnera la délivrance.   **\n\nJob 10 verset 7   **\nTu sais que je ne suis pas méchant ; et nul ne peut délivrer de ta main. Daniel a délivré de la fosse aux lions les trois enfants hébreux du feu de Nebucadnetsar. Ils avaient tous cette assurance, 'Mon Dieu me délivrera.'  **\nDaniel. 3 verset 16 à 30   **\n16 Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego répondirent et dirent au roi   Ô Nebucadnetsar, nous ne prenons pas soin de te répondre sur cette affaire.\n17 S'il en est ainsi, notre Dieu que nous servons peut nous délivrer de la fournaise ardente, et il nous délivrera de ta main, ô roi.\n18Mais sinon, sache, ô roi, que nous ne servirons pas tes dieux, et que nous n'adorerons pas la statue d'or que tu as dressée.\n19 Alors Nebucadnetsar fut plein de fureur, et la forme de son visage fut changée contre Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego ; c'est pourquoi il parla , et ordonna qu'ils chauffent la fournaise une fois sept fois plus qu'elle n'avait l'habitude de chauffer.\n20 Et il ordonna aux hommes les plus puissants qui étaient dans son armée de lier Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego, et de les jeter dans la fournaise ardente.\n21 Alors ces hommes furent liés dans leurs tuniques, leurs chausses, leurs chapeaux et leurs autres vêtements, et furent jetés au milieu de la fournaise ardente.\n22 C'est pourquoi, parce que l'ordre du roi était pressant et que la fournaise était extrêmement chaude, la flamme du feu tua les hommes qui avaient pris Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego.\n23 Et ces trois hommes, Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego, tombèrent liés au milieu de la fournaise ardente.\n24 Alors le roi Nebucadnetsar fut étonné, et se leva en hâte, et parla , et dit à ses conseillers   N'avons -nous pas jeté trois hommes liés au milieu du feu ? Ils répondirent et dirent au roi   Vrai, ô roi.\n25 Il répondit et dit   Voici , je vois quatre hommes libres, marchant au milieu du feu, et ils n'ont pas de mal ; et la forme du quatrième est comme le Fils de Dieu.\n26 Alors Nebucadnetsar s'approcha de la bouche de la fournaise ardente, et parla , et dit   Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego, vous serviteurs du Dieu très-haut , sortez et venez ici. Alors Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego sortirent du milieu du feu.\n27 Et les princes, les gouverneurs et les capitaines, et les conseillers du roi, étant assemblés, virent ces hommes, sur le corps desquels le feu n'avait aucun pouvoir, et aucun cheveu de leur tête n'était roussi, ni leurs manteaux n'étaient changés, ni l' odeur du feu était passé sur eux.\n28 Alors Nebucadnetsar prit la parole et dit   Béni soit le Dieu de Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego, qui a envoyé son ange, et a délivré ses serviteurs qui se confiaient en lui, et qui ont changé la parole du roi, et ont rendu leurs corps, afin qu'ils puissent ne servent ni n'adorent aucun dieu, si ce n'est leur propre Dieu. 29 C'est pourquoi je décrète que tout peuple, toute nation et toute langue qui parleront de travers contre le dieu de Shadrach, de Meshach et d'Abednego, seront mis en pièces, et leurs maisons deviendront un fumier; car il n'y a pas d'autre Dieu qui puisse délivrer après ce genre.\n30 Alors le roi éleva Shadrach, Meshac et Abednego, dans la province de Babylone.  **\n\nNotre Dieu nous délivrera. Il reste un libérateur dans n'importe quel état   confus, complexe, problème avec l'homme, la femme, le gouvernement, la cour, les voisins , les relations, les institutions ou quoi que ce soit. Venez à Lui dans le domaine de la foi. Rencontrez-le dans la foi et vous verrez la délivrance dans votre vie.   **\n\n2 Corinthiens.1 verset 8 à 10   **\nCar nous ne voudrions pas, frères, que vous ignoriez nos ennuis qui nous sont arrivés en Asie, que nous étions pressés hors de mesure, au-dessus de nos forces, au point que nous désespérions même de la vie.\nMais nous avions la sentence de mort en nous-mêmes, que nous ne devions pas nous confier en nous-mêmes, mais en Dieu qui ressuscite les morts.\nQui nous a délivrés d'une si grande mort, et qui délivre, en qui nous avons confiance qu'il nous délivrera encore ;  **\n\nPsaumes 50 verset 15   **\nEt invoquez-Moi au jour de détresse; Je te délivrerai, et tu me glorifieras.  **\n\n2.1.6 La foi peut vous donner la prospérité    **\nJob 36 verset 11   **\n\"S'ils lui obéissent et le servent, ils passeront leurs jours dans la prospérité et leurs années dans les plaisirs.\"  **\nPourquoi luttons-nous seuls et laissons-nous Dieu hors de notre chemin ? Pourquoi laissez-vous Dieu de côté ? Pourquoi suivez-vous les formules de cette terre et oubliez-vous le Créateur ? Vous n'avez pas de travail et vous ne savez pas que Dieu fait un chemin là où il n'y en a pas ? Montez à Lui dans le domaine de la foi et rencontrez-Le là-bas. Tout est possible à Celui qui croit.   **\nPsaume 81 verset 13 à 16   **\n13 Que mon peuple m'ait écouté, et qu'Israël ait marché dans mes voies !\n14 J'aurais bientôt vaincu leurs ennemis et tourné ma main contre leurs adversaires.\n15\tLes ennemis de l'Éternel auraient dû se soumettre à lui, mais leur temps aurait dû durer à toujours .\n16\tIl aurait dû les nourrir aussi avec le meilleur du froment, et avec du miel du rocher aurais-je dû te rassasier. N'attendez pas les formules ou les principes de cette vie. Là où les principes échouent, allez à Celui qui surpasse les principes, le Dieu des cieux. Il a une autre voie pour vous et vous prospérerez dans cette vie. La foi en Dieu vous apportera la prospérité.  **\n\nN'attendez pas les formules ou les principes de cette vie.

La foi en Dieu vous apportera la prospérité.   **\n\nPremières Chroniques 4 verset 9,10    **\n«Et Jabez était plus honorable que ses frères  et sa mère appela son nom Jabez, disant  Parce que je l'ai porté avec douleur.\nEt Jabez invoqua le Dieu d'Israël, disant   Oh , que tu me bénisses vraiment, et que tu élargisses mon territoire, et que ta main soit avec moi, et que tu me gardes du mal, afin qu'il ne m'afflige pas ! Et Dieu lui accorda ce qu'il demandait . »   **\nLuc 5 verset 4 à 7   **\nOr, quand il eut fini de parler, il dit à Simon, lance-toi dans l'abîme, et jette tes filets pour boire.\n5 Et Simon, répondant, lui dit   Maître, nous avons travaillé toute la nuit, et nous n'avons rien pris, néanmoins sur ta parole je jetterai le filet.\n6 Et quand ils eurent fait cela, ils enfermèrent une grande multitude de poissons, et leur frein de filet.\n7 Et ils firent signe à leurs compagnons, qui étaient dans l'autre bateau, de venir les secourir. Et ils vinrent, et remplirent les deux navires, de sorte qu'ils commencèrent à couler.  **\n\n2.1.7 La foi peut vous donner le miracle désiré    **\n\nMarc 11 verset 24   **\n« C'est pourquoi je vous dis, quelles que soient les choses que vous désirez, quand vous priez, croyez que vous les recevez, et vous les aurez.  **\n\n'Par conséquent, tout ce que vous désirez...

Le miracle de l'argent (percée financière), la foi peut vous le donner. De bonnes choses arriveront dans votre vie.   **\n\nPremier Samuel 1 verset 9 à 15,19,20,26,27.   **\n9 Anne se leva donc après qu'ils eurent mangé à Silo et qu'ils eurent bu. Le sacrificateur Éli était assis sur un siège près d'un poteau du temple de l'Éternel.\n10Et elle etait dans l'amertume de l'ame, et priait l'Eternel, et pleurait amèrement.\n11 Et elle fit un vœu, et dit   Ô Éternel des armées, si tu regardes vraiment l'affliction de ta servante, et que tu te souviennes de moi, et que tu n'oublies pas ta servante, mais que tu donnes à ta servante un enfant mâle, alors je donne-le à l'Éternel tous les jours de sa vie, et il n'y aura pas de rasoir sur sa tête.\n12 Et il arriva, comme elle continuait à prier devant l'Éternel, qu'Eli marqua sa bouche.\n13 Or Hannah, elle a parlé dans son coeur; seules ses lèvres remuaient, mais sa voix n'était pas entendue; donc Eli pensait qu'elle avait été ivre.\n14 Et Éli lui dit   Jusques à quand seras-tu ivre ? ôte ton vin loin de toi.\n16\tEt Anne répondit et dit  Non , mon seigneur, je suis une femme d'un esprit triste, je n'ai bu ni vin ni boisson forte, mais j'ai répandu mon âme devant l'Éternel.\n19 Et ils se levèrent de bon matin, et se prosternèrent devant l'Éternel, et s'en retournèrent, et vinrent dans leur maison à Rama; et Elqana connut Anne sa femme; et l'Éternel se souvint d'elle.\n20 C'est pourquoi il arriva, lorsque vint le temps après qu'Anne eut conçu, qu'elle enfanta un fils, et appela son nom Samuel, en disant   Parce que je l'ai demandé à l'Éternel.\n26 Et elle dit   Ô mon seigneur, aussi ton âme vit , mon seigneur, je suis la femme qui se tenait ici à côté de toi, priant l'Éternel.\n27 Pour cet enfant j'ai prié; et l'Éternel m'a donné ma requête que je lui ai demandée    **\n\nCHAPITRE 3   **\nFOI, TEMPS ET SAISON   **\n3.1 La foi fonctionne avec les temps et les saisons   **\nGenèse. 18 verset 14   **\n « Y a-t -il quelque chose de trop dur pour l'Éternel ? Au temps fixé, je reviendrai vers toi, selon le temps de la vie, et Sarah aura un fils.  **\nMalgré le fait que la foi peut tout vous donner, vous devez savoir que cela fonctionne avec les temps et les saisons.   **\nEcclésiaste 3 verset 1   **\n« Il y a une saison pour tout, et un temps pour chaque chose sous le ciel   »  **\nMême la foi a aussi une saison et un temps. Dieu lui-même a des moments et des saisons pendant lesquels il fait des choses. Jésus a dit à sa mère  \"Mon heure n'est pas encore venue\" (Jean. 2 verset 4)    **\nActes 1 verset 6,7   **\n6 Lorsqu'ils furent donc assemblés, ils l'interrogèrent, disant   Seigneur, veux-tu en ce moment rétablir le royaume d'Israël ?\n7Et il leur dit  Ce n'est pas a vous de connaitre les temps ni les saisons que le Pere a mis en son pouvoir.  **\n\n3.2. Vous avez votre temps, le père a le sien   **\n(La certitude de la promesse de Dieu )  **\nEsaïe 55 verset 8, 9   **\n8\tCar mes pensées ne sont pas vos pensées, et vos voies ne sont pas mes voies, dit l'Éternel.\n9\tCar, comme les cieux sont plus hauts que la terre, ainsi Mes voies sont plus hautes que vos voies, et Mes pensées sont plus hautes que vos pensées.  **\nMes voies ne sont pas vos voies, Mes pensées ne sont pas vos pensées, Mon temps n'est pas votre temps, Ma saison n'est pas votre saison. Cependant, le mot ne manquera pas. Le Père a le temps de la foi entre Ses mains.\nDepuis votre propre temps de foi jusqu'au temps de foi de Dieu quand il sera accompli, c'est ce qu'on appelle la patience. Il y a une distance là-bas. Cette route que vous empruntez s'appelle « la route de la Foi et de la Patience ». Le propre chemin d'Abraham a pris lui 25 ans.   **\n\nHébreux 6 verset 12 à 15   **\n12 afin que vous ne soyez pas paresseux, mais que vous suiviez ceux qui, par la foi et la patience, héritent des promesses.\n13 Car lorsque Dieu fit la promesse à Abraham, parce qu'il ne pouvait jurer par un plus grand, il jura par lui-même,\n14 Disant   Certainement , en bénissant, je te bénirai, et en multipliant, je te multiplierai.\n15 Et ainsi, après avoir patiemment enduré, il obtint la promesse.  **\nLa foi le fait au moment promis (désigné). La foi fera en sorte que ce pour quoi vous avez cru en Dieu s'accomplit au temps fixé.   **\n3.3 Le juste vivra par sa foi   **\nHébreux 2 verset 1 à 4   **\n1 Je me tiendrai sur ma garde, et je me placerai sur la tour, et je veillerai pour voir ce qu'il me dira, et ce que je répondrai quand je serai repris.\n2\tEt l'Éternel me répondit, et dit  Écris la vision, et écris-la clairement sur des tables, afin que celui qui la lise coure .\n3\tCar la vision est encore pour un temps fixé, mais à la fin elle parlera et ne mentira pas; même s'il tarde, attendez-le; car il viendra sûrement, il ne tardera pas.\n4\tVoici, son âme qui s'élève n'est pas droite en lui, mais le juste vivra par sa foi.  **\nPouvez-vous comprendre le pouvoir, la parole et les actions de la foi ? Il se matérialisera et portera des fruits, mais au moment fixé. Il y a un moment où vous verrez cette guérison se manifester. Il y aura un moment où vous verrez ce miracle accordé, et vous verrez cet ennemi réellement vaincu. Il y a un moment où vous verrez cette chose que vous recherchez fournie. Il viendra un temps où vous verrez la victoire réalisée. Il y aura un temps où vous verrez que la voiture sera achetée, un temps viendra où la maison pour laquelle vous avez fait confiance à Dieu sera construite. Il viendra un moment où vous direz   « J'ai terminé mon école ». Un temps vient où vous vous exclamerez et direz de votre femme   « C'était la femme que j'avais voulu épouser et je ne savais pas comment cela fonctionnerait. J'ai décidé de le confier à Dieu dans des prières et voyez, elle est maintenant à moi ! C'est le temps de la foi. Attendez, ça arrivera ! Cela arrivera !   **\n\nHébreux 6 verset 13 à 19   **\n13 Car lorsque Dieu fit la promesse à Abraham, parce qu'il ne pouvait jurer par un plus grand, il jura par lui-même,\n14 Disant   Certainement , en bénissant, je te bénirai, et en multipliant, je te multiplierai.\n15 Et ainsi, après avoir patiemment enduré, il obtint la promesse.\n16 Car les hommes jurent en vérité par le plus grand ; et un serment de confirmation est pour eux la fin de toute querelle.\n17\tOù Dieu, voulant plus abondamment montrer aux héritiers de la promesse l'immuabilité de son conseil, le confirma par un serment.\n\n18\tQue par deux choses immuables, dans lesquelles il était impossible à Dieu de mentir, nous pouvions avoir une forte consolation, qui avons fui en refuge pour saisir l'espérance placée devant nous ;\n\n19\tQuelle espérance nous avons comme ancre de l'âme, à la fois sûre et inébranlable , et qui entre dans celle-ci à l'intérieur du voile ;   **\n\nVous avez peut-être prié pour la conversion de votre conjoint, sachez simplement qu'après la prière de la foi, un temps de matérialisation est là, attendez-le. Un moment viendra où votre mari portera cette Bible avec vous et vous deux irez pour l'évangélisation ensemble ! Car avec Dieu, tout est possible. Tout est possible à celui qui croit. Mais il y a un temps entre la prière et l'accomplissement   le temps de la foi, le temps d' attendre.   **\\n\nPsaume 27 verset 13, 14   **\n13 Je m'étais évanoui, si je n'avais cru voir la bonté de l'Éternel dans le pays des vivants.\n14 Espère en l'Éternel, prends courage, et il fortifiera ton cœur. attendez, dis-je, en l' Éternel.   **\n3.4 N'abandonnez pas votre foi   **\nVous devez apprendre et comprendre cela afin de ne pas abandonner le chemin de la foi. Le diable est celui qui vous torture, se moque et vous nargue pour que vous doutez et avortez votre foi. Tout comme un enfant qui a été formé dans l'utérus mais a été avorté, votre foi a été formée, mais le diable veut que vous l'avortiez. La foi est là, vous l'avez suivie, mais elle peut avorter si vous ne comprenez pas.   **\nOsée 4 verset 6   **\n\"Les miens sont détruits par manque de connaissance; parce que tu as rejeté la connaissance, je te rejetterai aussi, de sorte que tu ne seras pas un sacrificateur pour moi, puisque tu as oublié la loi de ton Dieu, j'oublierai aussi tes enfants .   **\nHébreux 10 verset 38, 39   **\n38 Le juste vivra par la foi, mais si quelqu'un recule , mon âme n'aura pas de plaisir en lui.\n39 Mais nous ne sommes pas de ceux qui reculent vers la perdition ; mais de ceux qui croient au salut de l'âme.  **\n3.5 Déclarez en quoi vous croyez en Dieu   **\nHabacuc 2 verset 1 à 4   **\n1 Je me tiendrai sur ma garde, et je me placerai sur la tour, et je veillerai pour voir ce qu'il me dira, et ce que je répondrai quand je serai repris.\n2Et l'Eternel me repondit, et dit  Ecrivez la vision, et ecrivez-la clairement sur des tables, afin que celui qui la lira coure .\n\n3Car la vision est encore pour un temps fixé, mais à la fin elle parlera, et ne mentira pas même si elle tarde, attends-la; car il viendra sûrement, il ne tardera pas\n4Voici, son âme qui s'élève n'est pas droite en lui; mais le juste vivra par sa foi.  **\n'Expliquez-le clairement', ne cachez pas ce pourquoi vous croyez en Dieu. Dites-le vous-même, avouez-le et dites aux autres si cela est nécessaire. N'en ayez pas honte. N'en doutez pas et ne le cachez pas . \"Cela viendra sûrement\", cela arrivera certainement. Il n'échouera pas, n'en doutez pas. Mais le problème de l'homme est le doute. Quand le Fils de l'homme viendra, trouvera-t-il la foi sur la terre ? Vous trouvera-t-il attendant la promesse de la foi ?   **\nLuc 18 verset 7, 8   **\n7 Et Dieu ne vengera-t-il pas ses élus, qui crient vers lui jour et nuit, bien qu'il tarde à les supporter ?\n8 Je vous dis qu'il les vengera bientôt. Néanmoins, lorsque le Fils de l'homme viendra, trouvera-t-il la foi sur la terre ?  **\n3.6 Dieu gérera l'intervalle entre la foi et l'accomplissement   **\nLa foi vous fera vivre, elle vous fera gagner et vaincre si vous l'apprenez. Dieu, qui a le temps, gérera cet intervalle de temps dans votre vie. Entre le moment où vous y croyez et le moment où il finira par se concrétiser , on ne sait pas. Mais quelle que soit sa durée, Dieu s'en chargera. 25 ans? Dieu s'en chargera. Quelle que soit la différence dans le moment, Dieu veillera à ce que la bénédiction ne vienne pas en retard. Cette chose ne se fera pas tard; il viendra en son temps. \"Dieu l'aidera et cela, très tôt.\"   **\n\nPsaumes 46 verset 5   **\n« Dieu est au milieu d'elle ; elle ne sera pas déplacée; Dieu l'aidera, et cela de bonne heure.  **\n3.7 La foi s'en charge à l' heure convenue   **\n Genèse 18 verset 14   **\n« Y a-t-il quelque chose de trop dur pour l'Éternel ? Au temps fixé, je reviendrai vers toi, selon le temps de la vie, et Sarah aura un fils.  **\nIl y a un temps fixé pour tout ou promesse. Frère, retourne et époussette ta foi car elle n'a pas encore expiré. Votre permis n'a pas encore expiré et donc il peut encore être reconnu par les policiers sur le chemin, il peut toujours vous accorder un laissez-passer. Au cas où vous êtes sur le point d'abandonner votre foi, ne l'abandonnez pas, car vous êtes beaucoup plus proche du moment de la matérialisation !   **\nRomains 13 verset 11   **\n« Et cela, connaissant le temps, qu'il est maintenant grand temps de se réveiller du sommeil, car maintenant notre salut est plus proche que lorsque nous avons cru.  **\nDieu a dit à Abraham, 'Au temps fixé'. Qui a fixé l'heure ? Était-ce Abraham ? Certainement pas. Ce n'est pas à vous de connaître les temps et les saisons que Dieu a gardés entre ses mains.   **\n\nActes 1 verset 7   **\nEt il leur dit   ce n'est pas à vous de connaître les temps ou les saisons que le Père a mis en sa propre puissance.  **\nParfois, cependant, Dieu peut communiquer le moment de l'accomplissement de la foi à votre cœur, comme dans le message du prophète Élisée   « À cette heure demain… », Dieu le fait.   **\nDeuxième Rois 7 verset 1  **\n« Alors Élisée dit   Écoutez la parole de l'Éternel, ainsi dit l'Éternel   Demain , à cette heure-ci, on vendra à la porte de Samarie une mesure de fleur de farine pour un sicle, et deux mesures d'orge pour un sicle. ”  **\nC'est uniquement parce que Dieu le lui a communiqué. Mais en général, les temps et les saisons sont entre ses mains. Dieu dit qu'Il a un temps fixé pour vous. Pourquoi ne le croyez-vous pas parce qu'il n'est pas encore venu ? Pourquoi abandonnez-vous votre foi et votre engagement parce qu'Il n'est pas encore venu ? Pourquoi tournez-vous le dos parce que Dieu n'est pas encore venu ?   **\n \nHébreux 10 verset 38, 39  **\n38 Le juste vivra par la foi, mais si quelqu'un recule , mon âme n'aura pas de plaisir en lui.\n39 Mais nous ne sommes pas de ceux qui reculent vers la perdition ; mais de ceux qui croient au salut de l'âme.  **\nNous avons ramassé la foi en Dieu, nous maintenons cette foi et notre foi doit s'accomplir. Notre foi doit être récompensée. Dieu a vraiment visité Sara au temps fixé. Selon le temps de la vie   n'est-ce pas la vie que Dieu va te donner, Sarah ? Il y a un temps où la vie viendra, car Dieu l'a calculé. Tout a son heure et sa saison. Rien ne peut être fait en retard par Dieu.  **\nJean 11 verset 21 à 45  **\n21Alors Marthe dit à Jésus   Seigneur, si tu avais été ici, mon frère ne serait pas mort.\n22 Mais je sais que même maintenant, tout ce que tu demanderas à Dieu, Dieu te le donnera.\n23 Jésus lui dit   Ton frère ressuscitera.\n24 Marthe lui dit   Je sais qu'il ressuscitera à la résurrection au dernier jour.\n25 Jésus lui dit   Je suis la résurrection et la vie ; celui qui croit en moi vivra, même s'il est mort ;\n26 Et quiconque vit et croit en moi ne mourra jamais. Croyez- vous cela?\n27 Elle lui dit   Oui, Seigneur, je crois que tu es le Christ, le Fils de Dieu, qui doit venir dans le monde.\n28 Et quand elle eut dit cela, elle s'en alla, et appela secrètement Marie sa sœur, disant   Le Maître est venu, et il t'appelle.\n29 Dès qu'elle entendit cela, elle se leva vivement et vint à lui.\n30 Or Jésus n'était pas encore entré dans la ville, mais il était au lieu où Marthe l'avait rencontré.\n31 Les Juifs donc qui étaient avec elle dans la maison et qui la consolaient, lorsqu'ils virent Marie, qu'elle se leva en hâte et sortit, la suivirent, disant   Elle va au tombeau pour y pleurer.\n32 Alors, quand Marie fut venue où était Jésus, et qu'elle le vit, elle se prosterna à ses pieds, lui disant   Seigneur, si tu avais été ici, mon frère ne serait pas mort.\n33 Lorsque Jésus la vit pleurer, et pleurer aussi les Juifs qui étaient venus avec elle, il soupira dans l'esprit et fut troublé,\n34 Et dit   Où l'avez-vous mis ? Ils lui dirent   Seigneur, viens et vois.\n35 Jésus pleura.\n36 Alors les Juifs dirent   Voyez comme il l'aimait !\n37 Et quelques-uns d'entre eux dirent   Cet homme, qui a ouvert les yeux des aveugles, n'aurait-il pas pu empêcher que cet homme ne meure ?\n38 Jésus donc, gémissant de nouveau en lui-même, vient au sépulcre. C'était une grotte, et une pierre était posée dessus.\n39 Jésus dit   Otez la pierre. Marthe, la soeur de celui qui était mort, lui dit  Seigneur, il pue maintenant , car il est mort depuis quatre jours.\n40 Jésus lui dit   Ne t'ai-je pas dit que, si tu croyais , tu verrais la gloire de Dieu ?\n41 Puis ils ôtèrent la pierre du lieu où les morts étaient déposés. Et Jésus leva les yeux et dit   Père, je te remercie de m'avoir exaucé.\n42 Et je savais que tu m'exauces toujours, mais à cause du peuple qui se tient là, je l'ai dit, afin qu'ils croient que tu m'as envoyé.\n43 Et ayant ainsi parlé, il cria d'une voix forte   Lazare, sors.\n44 Et celui qui était mort sortit, pieds et poings liés, avec des nappes funéraires ; et son visage était enveloppé d'une serviette. Jésus leur dit   Déliez- le, et laissez-le aller.\n45 Alors plusieurs des Juifs qui étaient venus à Marie, et qui avaient vu les choses que Jésus avait faites, crurent en lui.  **\n\nL'Écriture ci-dessus a montré qu'aucun temps n'est trop tard aux yeux de Dieu, et qu'il n'y a pas de retard dans Son plan, mais que Son nom devrait être glorifié à la fin, comme dans le cas ci-dessus de Lazare.   **\n3.8 La foi parle à la fin.  **\nLa foi devient une substance à la fin, elle devient tangible à la fin. La foi forme la substance physique à la fin.   **\nHébreux 11 verset 1, 2   **\n1 Or la foi est l'assurance des choses qu'on espère, la preuve de celles qu'on ne voit pas.\n2Car c'est par elle que les anciens ont obtenu un bon rapport.  **\n\nPar substance, cela signifie que vous pouvez maintenant le toucher et le sentir. Par preuve, cela signifie que vous pouvez maintenant le voir avec votre œil physique, mais vous le verrez à la fin. Les bénédictions de la foi viennent à la fin. En ce moment , c'est dans votre cœur dans le domaine de la foi. La réalité viendra à la fin du temps de la foi.   **\n\nPremier Pierre 1 verset 9   **\n\"Recevoir la fin de votre foi, même le salut de vos âmes.\"  **\n\n La foi n'est pas continue sans fin. Il a une fin. La foi touche à sa fin et c'est à la fin la substance que vous espériez pour des mensonges. C'est à la fin de la foi que l'évidence que vous avez crue sera vue. La foi vous le montrera.   **\n\nLa foi est comme le pain que vous jetez dans l'eau et attendez qu'il monte à la surface de l'eau. La Bible dit   « jette ton pain sur les eaux et tu le trouveras après plusieurs jours » (Ecclésiaste 11 verset 1). Il y a le temps qui s'écoule entre le moulage du pain et le « trouver sur le dessus – après plusieurs jours ! » En quoi ces journées sont-elles épanouissantes ? Ils sont nécessaires pour permettre à l'eau de recouvrir le pain et d'y tremper très bien chaque particule, de sorte que le pain perdra complètement son poids et remontera à la surface de l'eau. Cela prendra certainement du temps, mais attendez !   **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 4    **\nFAITH VOUS INFORME D' ATTENDRE   **\n\nEsaïe 28 verset 16   **\n« C'est pourquoi ainsi parle le Seigneur Dieu   Voici, je pose en Sion pour fondement une pierre, une pierre éprouvée, une pierre précieuse d'angle, un fondement sûr, celui qui croit ne se hâtera pas.  **\n\n4.1\tCelui qui croit ne se hâtera pas.  **\nFaith parle et informe son peuple d'attendre. Êtes-vous un homme ou une femme de foi? Alors Faith vous dit d'attendre. Il y a un temps d'attente.   **\n\nPsaumes. 27 verset 14   **\n« Attendez-vous à l'Éternel, soyez de bon courage, et il fortifiera ton cœur   attends, dis-je, en l'Éternel.  **\nVous avez prié, maintenant attendez. Vous avez cru, maintenant attendez. Attendez-vous au SEIGNEUR. Bon courage car le temps d'attente risque d'être long, Frère, tu désires te marier et tu as prié mais quand tu regardes autour de toi, tu ne vois aucune dame à épouser, attends. Sœur, à l'endroit où vous êtes, vous vous sentez seule et quand vous regardez autour de vous, personne n'est qualifié pour vous épouser à cet endroit, eh bien, Dieu n'a pas dit que vous vous marieriez à cet endroit, mais qu'il vous donnera un mari . Attends. C'est la voix de Dieu pour vous.   **\n\nPsaumes. 40 verset 1 à 4   **\n« 1 J'ai attendu patiemment l'Éternel ; et il s'inclina vers moi, et entendit mon cri.\nIl m'a aussi fait sortir d' une fosse horrible, de l'argile fangeuse, et a posé mes pieds sur un rocher, et a établi mes allées.\nEt il a mis un cantique nouveau dans ma bouche, la louange à notre Dieu. Beaucoup le verront, et craindront, et se confieront en l'Éternel.\nHeureux cet homme qui fait confiance à l'Éternel, et qui ne respecte pas les orgueilleux, ni ceux qui se tournent vers le mensonge.  **\n Le problème est que vous ne voulez pas souffrir du tout. Mais savez-vous que Dieu s'intéresse à votre souffrance ? Il veut cela, afin que lorsque la réponse viendra, vous serez si heureux et en témoignerez. Ce sera si doux que vous ne serez pas silencieux à ce sujet. Le sommeil d'un homme qui travaille est doux (Ecclésiaste 5 verset 12). Il a tellement travaillé que quand il s'endormira, ce sera profond et doux.   **\nPremier Pierre 5 verset 10   **\n\"Mais le Dieu de toute grâce, qui nous a appelés à sa gloire éternelle par le Christ Jésus, après que vous aurez souffert un moment, vous rendra parfait, vous affermira, vous fortifiera.\"  **\nLa Bible dit, 'Mais le Dieu de toute grâce… après que vous ayez souffert un moment', ce qui signifie qu'Il s'intéresse à votre souffrance et c'est pourquoi Il a dit que vous devriez attendre   **\nPremier Pierre 5 verset 8 à 11   **\n« Soyez sobres, soyez vigilants ; parce que votre adversaire, le diable, rôde comme un lion rugissant, cherchant qui il dévorera ;\nQui résistez avec fermeté dans la foi, sachant que les mêmes afflictions s'accomplissent chez vos frères qui sont dans le monde.\nMais le Dieu de toute grâce, qui nous a appelés à sa gloire éternelle par Jésus-Christ, après que vous aurez souffert un certain temps, vous rendra parfait, vous affermira, vous fortifiera, vous affermira.\nA Lui soit la gloire et la domination pour toujours et à jamais. Amen.\"  **\n Vous pouvez protester et dire   « Mais mon Dieu, ça me fait mal ! Sa réponse à vous est, 'Attendez dans la douleur. J'arrive.' Vous pouvez aussi dire   « Mon Dieu, ça me fait honte ! Il vous dira   \" Honte à cause de la justice ? Soyez là. Quand la gloire viendra, vous vous réjouirez d'une joie extrême. 'Combien de temps, Seigneur?' Aussi longtemps que le temps dans Sa main. Attend le. Abraham a attendu sans date pendant vingt-cinq ans. Vous devriez également attendre; seul Dieu sait le bon moment et combien de temps, ce qui, selon Lui, doit sûrement arriver. Après que vous ayez souffert un certain temps, Dieu perfectionnera votre vie, vous établira, vous fortifiera, vous établira et vous rendra bon ! Attendez-Le simplement.   **\n4.2\tLa patience est nécessaire pour vous faire attendre    **\nÊtre patient signifie, attendre si nécessaire ; ne pas s'emporter en attendant, ne pas se soucier d'attendre. La patience donne le pouvoir et l'énergie d'attendre la manifestation de la foi. Par conséquent, soyez patient. Car le laboureur (le fermier) attend la première et la dernière pluie avant de pouvoir récolter. Il attend, alors attends. Avez-vous cru Dieu ? Puis attendre.   **\n\nJacques 5 verset 7, 10, 11   **\n7 Soyez donc patients, frères, jusqu'à la venue du Seigneur. Voici, le laboureur attend le précieux fruit de la terre, et a une longue patience pour cela, jusqu'à ce qu'il reçoive la pluie de la première et de l'arrière-saison.\n10\tPrenez, mes frères, les prophètes, qui ont parlé au nom du Seigneur, pour un exemple d'affliction et de patience.\n11 Voici, nous comptons heureux ceux qui endurent. Vous avez entendu parler de la patience de Job, et vous avez vu la fin du Seigneur ; que le Seigneur est très miséricordieux et d'une tendre miséricorde.  **\n4.3 Importance de la patience   **\n4.3.1 La patience apaise le cœur   **\nSi quelqu'un vous dit   'Attends-moi ici. Je serai de retour!' Précise-t-il une heure ? Mais tu peux décider de te dire que même si on ne t'a pas donné de temps précis, tu vas te donner du temps. Vous pouvez vous dire que vous allez rester paisiblement deux heures à l'attendre. Lorsque vous vous informerez de votre décision personnelle, vous inquiéterez-vous ? Non. Et s'il arrive dans 20 minutes, est-il arrivé en retard ? En fait, il est venu une heure 40 minutes plus tôt que prévu, car vous avez prévu 2 heures d'attente. La patience est cette provision dans votre vie pour attendre la manifestation de la foi. Par elle, vous êtes rendu paisible. Vous avez besoin de patience pour pouvoir recevoir la promesse.  **\nHébreux. 10 verset 36   **\n« Car vous avez besoin de patience, afin qu'après avoir fait la volonté de Dieu, vous receviez la promesse.  **\n4.3.2 La patience annule la peur du cœur     **\nLa peur que vos attentes ne soient pas satisfaites sera annulée lorsque vous vous informerez d'être patient.   **\nRomains. 8 verset 25 \"Mais si nous espérons ce que nous ne voyons pas, nous l'attendons avec patience.\"  **\n4.3.3 La patience confesse de bouche     **\n C'est parce que, le cœur peut dire, 'et si ça n'arrive pas?' Mais la patience dira   'Cela arrivera. Cela se fera, c'est bien, le Seigneur le fera, Il répondra, Il accomplira Sa parole. Le Seigneur l'accomplira'.   **\n4.3.4 La patience est l'antidote à l'avortement de la semence de la foi   **\n La graine de foi qui se forme en vous peut facilement mourir sauf si la patience entre en jeu. La patience protège cette semence de foi contre l'avortement. C'est sensible. Votre foi peut facilement être affectée, mais la patience vous dit   « Non, restez ici et attendez ».   **\nColossiens. 1 verset 11   **\n\"Fortifié de toutes forces, selon sa puissance glorieuse, jusqu'à toute patience et longanimité avec joie \" ;  **\n4.3.5 La patience renouvelle la force des croyants   **\n ainsi, ils peuvent continuer à croire. Vous êtes exhorté à endurer patiemment. Vous avez besoin d'énergie pour avancer ou pour rester immobile. La patience renouvelle cette énergie.   **\nRomains. 15 verset 4   **\n\"Car tout ce qui a été écrit auparavant a été écrit pour notre instruction, afin que nous ayons de l'espoir, grâce à la patience et au confort des Écritures.\"  **\n 4.3.6 La patience renforce l'espérance et fait espérer les croyants contre l'espérance   **\nRomains 4 verset 17 à 22   **\n17\t(Comme il est écrit, je t'ai établi père d'une multitude de nations) devant celui en qui il a cru, même Dieu, qui vivifie les morts et appelle comme si elles étaient ce qui n'est pas.\n18\tQui contre toute espérance a cru en l'espérance, afin de devenir le père de plusieurs nations, selon ce qui a été dit, Ainsi sera ta semence .\n19\tEt n'étant pas faible dans la foi, il ne considérait pas son propre corps maintenant mort, alors qu'il avait environ cent ans, ni encore la mort du ventre de Sara;\n20\tIl n'a pas chancelé devant la promesse de Dieu par incrédulité ; mais était fort dans la foi, rendant gloire à Dieu;\n21\tEt étant pleinement persuadé que ce qu'il avait promis, il pouvait aussi l'accomplir.\n22\tEt c'est pourquoi cela lui fut imputé à justice.  **\nPatience a dit à Abraham que ce serait encore fait. Même lorsque Sarah avait cessé d'avoir ses règles, la patience lui a dit   « Ne t'inquiète pas du fait qu'elle a cessé d'avoir ses règles, car cela arrivera quand même ».   **\nDonnez de la place à la patience dans votre vie. Le Seigneur affirme toujours que la situation de votre femme ou de votre mari changera. Pourquoi ne le croirez-vous pas ? Ne dites pas   'Pourquoi cela ne s'est-il pas produit pendant tout ce temps ?' Être patient. Le Seigneur dit toujours que vous gagnerez, vous le réaliserez. Ne lui dites pas   'Depuis combien de temps dis-tu cela ?' Être patient. Vous viendrez le voir plus tard. Le Seigneur dit toujours que vous allez vous marier et vous vous demandez   « Mariez-vous ? Soyez juste patient; donnez-Lui du temps. Attendez Son heure. La patience a protégé Abraham de l'incrédulité et a renouvelé sa force. La patience l'a aidé à venir à bout de la foi.   **\n4.3.7 La patience préserve l'âme et la fait participer sûrement aux bienfaits de la foi   **\nLuc. 2 verset 19   **\n« Dans votre patience, possédez vos âmes.  **\nC'est dans votre patience que vous posséderez vos bénédictions, votre victoire, votre guérison et votre délivrance ; et dans ta patience, tu recevras ta couronne.   **\n\nCHAPITRE 5   **\nCONSEILS ET PRIÈRES   **\n 5.1 Conseils de patience   **\nProverbes 4 verset 1, 2   **\n1 Écoutez, mes enfants, l'instruction d'un père, et veillez à connaître l'intelligence.  **\n2\tCar je vous donne une bonne doctrine, n'abandonnez pas ma loi.  **\n\nAchetez la foi et la patience - N'y allez pas uniquement avec la foi, sinon vous sauterez le pas. Allez-y aussi avec patience. La patience est indispensable dans l'exercice de la foi dans sa vie.   **\nAppliquez la foi et la patience - Ne prenez pas seulement la foi. Attendez, car la foi a besoin de patience pour être complète dans votre cas. Attendez, car la foi a du temps et demande de la patience.   **\nPersévérez dans la foi et la patience - Continuez à prier et continuez à attendre. Accumuler de la puissance. Continuez simplement à prier et à accumuler de l'énergie. Lorsque les larmes rempliront votre bouteille, il y aura explosion.   **\n\nPsaumes. 56 verset 8   **\n« Tu racontes mes errances ; mets-tu mes larmes dans ta bouteille, ne sont-elles pas dans ton livre ?  **\n\n\n5.2 Prières pour vous   **\nRomains 15 verset 4 à 6   **\n4 Car tout ce qui a été écrit auparavant l'a été pour notre instruction, afin que nous ayons l'espérance, par la patience et la consolation des Écritures.\n5\tMaintenant, que le Dieu de patience et de consolation vous accorde d'avoir les mêmes sentiments les uns envers les autres selon Jésus-Christ ;\n6\tAfin que vous puissiez, d'un même esprit et d'une seule bouche, glorifier Dieu, le Père de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.  **\nJe prie pour que le Seigneur augmente la patience dans votre vie ! Le degré de patience augmentera dans votre vie ! La quantité de patience augmentera dans votre vie, et alors vous deviendrez un réalisateur. Satan ne vous vaincra pas avec le temps. Que Dieu récompense votre foi et votre patience.   **\nPar la foi et la patience, vous serez guéri. Par la foi et la patience, votre délivrance sera certaine. Ce rêve maléfique qui vous troublait, pour lequel vous avez prié, disparaîtra. Attendez le moment de l'action quand le Seigneur se lèvera, ce rêve cessera ! Ne vous sentez pas comme si le diable se moquait de vous parce que vous avez prié et que vous n'avez pas encore vu la réponse. Priez et attendez. Cette invocation du nom de Jésus explosera soudainement un jour et l'ennemi n'y survivra pas.   **\nPar la foi et la patience, vous vous marierez. Par la foi et la patience, femme, tu enfanteras un enfant. Pour cet enfant j'ai prié, puis j'ai attendu et puis le Seigneur me l'a donné. Le Seigneur le fera pour vous comme il l'a fait pour Sarah et Elizabeth.   **\nPremier Samuel 1 verset 27   **\n« Pour cet enfant, j'ai prié ; et l'Éternel m'a donné la demande que je lui ai adressée   « Par la foi et la patience, tu auras le bonheur. Le travail ou le travail à faire viendra. Vous ferez venir les connexions souhaitées. Le Seigneur vous élèvera ! Le Seigneur vous encouragera. Il réglera votre situation; Il vous y conduira et vous fera asseoir sur le trône. Toutes les moqueries qu'ils ont faites de vous seront changées en louanges.\nGrâce à la foi et à la patience, la situation laide de votre vie se rendra. Cette situation laide qui vous apporte des larmes et de la honte, se rendra. Attends. Il m'a fait sortir d'un gouffre horrible… Vous sortez de cet endroit ! Le Seigneur vous fera sortir de cet endroit ou de cette situation laide. Par la puissance du Seigneur, je décrète que cette maladie disparaîtra de votre vie au nom de Jésus !\nAttendez-le. Quand Jésus a maudit le figuier, c'est le lendemain qu'ils l'ont vu se dessécher, mais la malédiction avait été levée la veille. La malédiction sur ce problème dans votre vie a été levée ; attendez-le, ces feuilles et cet arbre (problèmes) vont sécher. Parce que la parole de Dieu a été prononcée et qu'elle ne peut revenir sans effet, ce problème sera réglé    **\nEsaïe 55 verset 10, 11   **\n10Car, comme la pluie tombe et la neige du ciel, et n'y retourne pas, mais arrose la terre et la fait germer et bourgeonner, afin qu'elle donne de la semence au semeur et du pain à celui qui mange \n11\tAinsi en sera-t-il de ma parole qui sort de ma bouche, elle ne reviendra pas à moi sans effet, mais elle accomplira ce que je veux, et elle prospérera dans la chose à laquelle je l'ai envoyée.  **\nLe Seigneur a dit, 'que la lumière soit', ainsi, la lumière apparaîtra dans votre vie ! La guérison viendra dans votre vie parce que le Seigneur a envoyé sa parole de guérison.\nIl envoya Sa parole et guérit le peuple et le délivra de toute sa destruction (Palms. 107 verset 20), donc ta délivrance arrive ! Le Seigneur a envoyé une parole pour renouveler votre force, et votre force sera renouvelée. Il renouvellera votre jeunesse comme celle de l'aigle. Le véhicule vous apportant l'accomplissement a décollé et vous rejoindra ! Bien qu'il tarde, attendez-le; cela doit être fait!   **\nFélicitations, vous allez le voir dans votre vie. Car Dieu n'est pas un homme pour mentir. Votre prière est entrée dans le registre de Dieu. Une date a été mise dessus et elle se concrétisera au bon moment.   **\nNombres 23 verset 19   **\n19 Dieu n'est pas un homme pour mentir; ni le fils de l'homme, qu'il devrait se repentir, n'a-t-il dit, et ne le fera-t-il pas? ou a-t-il parlé, et ne le rendra-t-il pas bon ?  **\nLes gens prient pour votre situation et Dieu a entendu leurs prières. Les anges arrivent sur le chemin! Quoi que retarde l'Ange Gabriel, ne vous inquiétez pas, car d'ici le 21 jour , il arrivera dans votre vie et les bénédictions du Seigneur viendront ! Réjouir! Votre vie changera pour le mieux. Le vêtement du fils prodigue sera ôté et le vêtement de la justice sera revêtu sur vous. La bénédiction et la liberté sont sur votre vie. Votre porte a été ouverte ! Le Seigneur a décrété le succès de votre vie. Votre devoir (ou tout ce que vous avez à faire) est de croire en Dieu, et cette chose se réalisera, votre ministère grandira et l'onction prendra le dessus sur votre vie au nom de Jésus !\n",

      "body": "LA GUÉRISON DE DIEU POUR SES ENFANTS PAR LA FOI ET L'UTILISATION DE LA MÉDECINE  **\n\nPRÉSENTATION  **\nCe livre, \"LA GUÉRISON DE DIEU POUR SES ENFANTS PAR LA FOI ET L'UTILISATION DE\nMÉDECINE », est l'une des cinquante publications chrétiennes que j'ai écrites pour nourrir les croyants du Christ avec la connaissance et la compréhension de la vérité biblique pour leur justice, leur paix et leur vie éternelle. Le livre montre à travers les écritures que la guérison divine par la foi en la parole de Dieu et le nom de Jésus est l'une des façons dont Dieu guérit les malades et délivre les opprimés. Le livre montre à travers les Écritures que Dieu guérit également par l'utilisation de médicaments, conventionnels ou à base de plantes. Il n'est pas conforme aux Écritures d'interdire l'utilisation de la médecine par les chrétiens comme cela se fait dans certaines églises confessionnelles.\nBeaucoup de gens dans les églises du Christ qui professent\nLe christianisme n'est pas vraiment chrétien ; ils vivent encore dans le péché. Demander à de telles personnes de ne pas recevoir de traitement médical mais d'utiliser uniquement la foi, c'est les diriger vers un Dieu qui ne les connaît pas et vers un Dieu qu'elles ne connaissent pas pour recevoir la bénédiction de Lui. Ce ne sont pas des enfants de Dieu.\nEncore une fois, certains membres de l'église qui sont croyants peuvent ne pas être capables de générer la foi en période de mauvaise santé. Ils ne peuvent pas être contraints de le faire. Le Dieu tout-sage a fourni un autre moyen de délivrer son peuple de la mort due au manque de foi pour la guérison divine. Ceux-ci sont capables d'exercer leur foi en Dieu pour les guérir lorsqu'ils reçoivent un traitement médical.\nQue chacun agisse selon la mesure de foi qu'il a en Dieu. Obtenir la guérison de Dieu par la foi ne garantit pas la vie éternelle.  **\nRomains 12 verset 3  **\n« Car je dis, par la grâce qui m'a été donnée, à tout homme qui est parmi vous, de ne pas s'estimer plus haut qu'il ne devrait l'être ; mais de penser sobrement, selon que Dieu a distribué à chacun la mesure de la foi.  **\nObtenir la guérison par l'utilisation de la médecine ne disqualifie pas le chrétien de la vie éternelle. Ce livre rend les choses claires scripturairement.  **\nRomains 14 verset 1 à 4, 22  **\n1\tCelui qui est faible dans la foi, recevez-le, mais pas pour des disputes douteuses.\n2\tCar l'un croit qu'il peut tout manger, l'autre, qui est faible, mange des herbes.\n3\tQue celui qui mange ne méprise pas celui qui ne mange pas ; et que celui qui ne mange pas ne juge pas celui qui mange; car Dieu l'a reçu.\nQui es-tu, toi qui juges le serviteur d'un autre homme ? à son propre maître il se tient debout ou tombe. Oui, il sera retenu car Dieu est capable de le faire tenir debout.\n22 As-tu la foi ? ayez-le pour vous devant Dieu. Heureux celui qui ne se condamne pas dans ce qu'il permet.  **\n\n\n\nCHAPITRE UN  **\nSERVIR LES AUTRES ET\nSE NÉGLIGER  **\n1.1 Laissez votre esprit, votre âme et votre corps être préservés\nIrréprochable  **\t \t \nDieu a créé l'homme avec trois parties   l'esprit, l'âme et le corps. Les trois sont des entités distinctes mais existent comme une seule. Chaque partie doit être bien entretenue pour bien vivre ici sur terre et dans l'éternité. Il est donc essentiel que vous preniez bien soin de votre esprit, de votre âme et de votre corps.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 5 verset 22 à 24  **\n22\tAbstenez-vous de toute apparence de mal.\n23\tEt le Dieu même de la paix vous sanctifie entièrement ; et je prie Dieu que tout ton esprit, ton âme et ton corps soient préservés sans reproche jusqu'à la venue de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.\n24\tCelui qui vous appelle est fidèle, qui le fera aussi.  **\nLes trois personnes dans un homme - l'esprit, l'âme et le corps, doivent être bien entretenues et bien préservées. C'est la responsabilité de Dieu de vous garder irréprochable jusqu'à la fin. C'est la responsabilité de Dieu et c'est aussi votre responsabilité. Si vous faites bien votre part, Dieu fera sûrement la sienne. C'est une alliance. C'est un accord entre Dieu et vous. Dieu fera sa part parce qu'il est fidèle, mais vous aussi devez jouer votre propre rôle. C'est une double responsabilité. C'est le désir de Dieu que nous soyons spirituellement féconds, saints et sains.  **\nTroisième Jean 1 à 2  **\n1\tL'aîné du bien-aimé Gaius, que j'aime dans la vérité.\n2\tBien-aimé, je souhaite par-dessus tout que tu prospères et sois en bonne santé, comme ton âme prospère.  **\nLa prospérité, la solidité et le bien-être de tout l'homme dans l'esprit, l'âme et le corps est ce que Dieu désire pour vous. Frères, désirez cela aussi pour vos semblables en Christ.\nDésirez leur solidité d'esprit, d'âme et de corps.  **\n1.2 L'esprit et l'âme  **\nL'esprit et l'âme forment l'homme spirituel, que nous ne voyons pas. Ce que nous voyons est le corps physique. Nous ne pouvons pas toucher notre esprit ou notre âme, et très souvent, l'esprit et l'âme sont liés très étroitement ensemble. La Bible dit que c'est la parole de Dieu qui peut séparer les deux, mais ce que nous voyons, c'est le corps.  **\nHébreux 4 verset 12  **\n\"Car la parole de Dieu est rapide, puissante et plus tranchante qu'aucune épée à double tranchant, perçant jusqu'à diviser l'âme et l'esprit, les jointures et la moelle, et discerne les pensées et les intentions des cœur.\"  **\nNous devrions souhaiter le bien-être de nos frères et sœurs (les frères). Souhaitez le bien-être des membres de votre Église. L'apôtre Paul a dit   Je n'ai pas hésité à vous présenter tout ce qui vous est profitable, car je désire votre bien-être. Je désire votre bien-être spirituel. Je désire aussi votre bien-être corporel, afin que vous puissiez prospérer en santé . Vous en avez besoin, vous devriez être en bonne santé dans le corps. Si vous n'êtes pas en bonne santé, comment ferez-vous l'œuvre de Dieu ?\nEncore une fois, il a dit, je prie Dieu, que votre esprit, votre âme et votre corps soient préservés sans reproche jusqu'à la venue du Seigneur. Voyez comment il a souhaité que vous continuiez dans le bien-être jusqu'à la fin, jusqu'à ce que le Seigneur vienne vous chercher, soit à la mort, soit à l'enlèvement. Il souhaite que vous meniez votre ministère jusqu'au bout. Vous avez besoin de préservation et cette préservation concerne votre corps, votre esprit et votre âme. Dieu désire que ceux qui s'occupent des autres dans l'évangile doivent aussi s'occuper d'eux-mêmes, afin qu'ils puissent être les premiers participants aux bienfaits de l'évangile. Les ministres doivent prendre soin d'eux-mêmes car Dieu veut un service complet et durable. Cela se produira lorsque nous prendrons soin de nous spirituellement et physiquement.  **\n\n\nDeuxième Timothée 2 verset 6  **\n\"Le laboureur qui travaille doit être le premier à avoir part aux fruits.\"  **\nLe Seigneur se préoccupe de votre esprit, de votre âme et de votre corps. Assurez-vous de bien prendre soin de votre corps physique. Assurez-vous de bien prendre soin de votre vie spirituelle. Pourquoi ce conseil est-il nécessaire ? C'est parce que de nombreux ouvriers et ministres chrétiens ne prennent pas soin de leur bien-être. Ils se négligent. Ils sont occupés à travailler pour les autres et négligent leur propre vie.  **\n1.3 L'implication (s) de s'occuper des autres et de se négliger   **\nCantique des Cantiques 1 verset 6  **\n« Ne me regarde pas, parce que je suis noir, parce que le soleil m'a regardé, les enfants de ma mère se sont fâchés contre moi ; ils m'ont fait gardien des vignes; mais je n'ai pas gardé ma vigne.  **\n\nHomme occupé! Femme occupée! Voyez cette femme, elle n'était pas noire avant. Elle avait le teint clair, mais maintenant, dit-elle, je suis devenue noire et la honte m'est tombée dessus. C'est pourquoi elle a dit, Oh non, ne me regarde pas. Elle se cache maintenant. Qu'est-ce qui lui a apporté cette noirceur ? Elle a dit qu'elle avait été occupée sous le soleil, travaillant, faisant ce travail et faisant ce travail. J'ai été occupé dans la cuisine. J'ai été occupé dans la maison. J'ai été occupé au marché. J'ai été occupé à travailler de haut en bas. Mais qu'est-ce qui vous a occupé ? Les êtres humains - Les enfants de ma mère m'ont occupé. J'étais occupé à les servir. J'étais occupé à servir les autres .  **\nVous êtes occupé à servir les autres dans l'Église. Vous êtes occupé à servir les autres dans votre ministère. Vous êtes occupé à servir les autres dans le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté. Bien que ce soit, mais voyez ce qu'elle a révélé - Ils m'ont nommé gardien des vignes. Vignobles au pluriel. La vigne de celui-ci, la vigne de celui-là ; Je vais ici, je vais là-bas, pour leur faire plaisir, parce qu'ils se fâchent contre moi. Je cours à sec pour garder les autres en paix. \"Ma propre vigne\" (j'en avais une pour moi), je ne l'ai pas gardée. \"La leur\", Oui, je suis occupé à courir après la leur, mais je n'ai pas gardé ma propre vigne. Regarde-moi maintenant, je suis noir. Le soleil m'a regardé. Pourquoi? Monter et descendre, soigner les vignes des gens, mais pas les miennes !\nVous avez une âme et vous avez un esprit. Vous êtes Pasteur. Vous avez un esprit qui pleure parce qu'il a spirituellement faim. Il pleure. Écoutez la voix et le cri de votre esprit qui aspire à la plénitude de Dieu.  **\nPsaumes 42 verset 1 ,2  **\n1\tComme le cerf soupire après les ruisseaux d'eau, ainsi mon âme soupire après toi, ô Dieu.\n2\tMon âme a soif de Dieu, du Dieu vivant  \nQuand viendrai-je comparaître devant Dieu ?\nVotre esprit pleure. Écoutez ce qu'il dit au verset 1   Comme le cerf soupire après les ruisseaux, ainsi mon âme soupire après toi, ô Dieu. Versets 2 ; Mon âme a soif de Dieu, du Dieu vivant   quand viendrai-je et paraîtrai-je devant Dieu ?   **\nC'est le cri de votre âme, mais vous êtes occupé à monter et descendre. Vous avez une âme qui peut mourir à cause du péché ; car l'âme qui pèche, elle mourra . Cette âme que vous affamez mourra ! Cette âme que vous ne nourrissez pas est votre propre vignoble. Votre âme pleure, pourtant, en tant que prédicateur, vous ne lui prêtez pas attention. En tant que prédicateur, en effet, les gens témoignent de votre service, ils ne sont plus en colère contre vous. Ils témoignent à quel point vous êtes gentil, mais votre âme n'est pas prise en charge et il pleure pour un salut authentique et éternel. Vous devez écouter et assister au cri.  **\n1.4 La loi de semer et de récolter  **\nGalates 6 verset 7, 8  **\n7\tNe vous y trompez pas ; On ne se moque pas de Dieu car tout ce qu'un homme sème, il le récoltera aussi.\n8\tCar celui qui sème pour sa chair récoltera de la chair la corruption; mais celui qui sème pour l'Esprit récoltera de l'Esprit la vie éternelle.  **\nIl y a des lois dans cette vie. Dieu ne changera pas les lois pour vous, sauf dans sa parfaite sagesse, là où c'est requis pour sa gloire, ce qui n'est pas souvent le cas. Il y a des formules dans la vie. Maintenant que tu n'as pas gardé ta vigne, qu'est-elle devenue ?  **\nCantique des Cantiques 2 verset 15  **\n\"Prenez-nous les renards, les petits renards, qui gâtent les vignes car nos vignes ont des raisins tendres.\"  **\nLes renards sont venus sur ta vigne. Personne n'est là pour s'occuper de votre vignoble. Petit à petit, vos tendres raisins se gâtent. Votre tendre et fraîche vie chrétienne est gâchée. Votre vraie paix spirituelle est maintenant dans les turbulences. Il n'est pas soigné. Vous vous êtes laissé longtemps négliger. Il défigure votre visage. Ce qui s'est passé? Tu n'as pas le temps! Vous n'avez pas coupé vos ongles. Nous pouvons voir de la saleté à l'intérieur et les gens disent   « qu'est-il arrivé à celui-ci ? Pourquoi est-ce comme ça ? Tu n'as pas le temps. Les renards ont pris le contrôle de votre vie. Peu, les renards et la tendresse de la vie chrétienne ont été détruits. La colère est maintenant entrée. Pourquoi la colère ne viendra-t-elle pas ? C'est une loi naturelle. La nature a horreur du vide. Quelque chose doit se produire lorsqu'une action requise est négligée.   **\nLa colère est venue parce que l'âme n'était pas nourrie. C'est pourquoi vous pouvez maintenant être en colère. La convoitise est entrée. Ce sont les renards. Pourquoi ne viendront-ils pas ? Vous avez affaire à des femmes autour de vous, à des hommes autour de vous. Qu'est-ce qui vous empêchera de convoiter ? Demandez-moi, qu'est-ce qui a empêché Pierre de sombrer dans la mer quand Jésus l'a invité à venir ? Ses yeux étaient tournés vers Jésus, mais quand ses yeux ont regardé à l'extérieur de Jésus, que lui est-il arrivé ? Il a commencé à couler. C'est une loi naturelle. La convoitise qui entre dans votre cœur est une loi naturelle. C'est parce que vous ne vous souciez pas de votre cœur.\nVous ne donnez pas au cœur ce qui est nécessaire pour le garder propre.  ** \nPsaumes 119 verset 11  **\n« J'ai caché ta parole dans mon cœur afin de ne pas pécher contre toi »  **\nAvez-vous pris le temps de mettre la parole de Dieu dans votre cœur aujourd'hui ? As-tu le temps? Quand vous vous réveillez le matin, lisez-vous la Bible ? Ces messages que vous écoutiez avant, les réécoutez-vous ? C'est une loi naturelle. Lorsque la saison sèche s'installe, les pierres dans le lit de la rivière seront visibles, car les eaux se sont taries. Pourquoi? La pluie a cessé. Votre propre pluie s'est arrêtée, c'est pourquoi la sécheresse que vous ressentez prend maintenant le dessus. Petits renards !\n \nVous n'êtes pas fort, mais vous travaillez toujours activement. Même lorsque Saül a quitté le Seigneur, n'était-il pas encore roi ? Vous êtes toujours en service. Les dons de Dieu sont sans repentance. Vous faites toujours preuve de dons. La fierté entre maintenant en jeu. Vous êtes même surpris vous-même. Votre discours contient maintenant quelques gros mots. Pourquoi? L'intérieur n'a pas de nettoyant. Comment serez-vous propre ? Maintenant vous êtes purs par la parole que je vous ai dite . Quelle parole avez-vous entendue de Jésus ? Aucun! Pourquoi les mots pollués ne sortiront-ils pas de vous ? Pourquoi les mensonges, les particules de mensonges ne seront-ils pas vus autour de vous ? C'est naturel. C'est une formule naturelle. Hé! Votre cas est grave car vous êtes considéré comme un homme de Dieu. Vous êtes une femme de Dieu respectée sérieusement en Christ, mais vous savez que vous êtes sale à l'intérieur.  **\nEcclésiaste 10 verset 1  **\n\" Les mouches mortes font que l'onguent de l'apothicaire dégage une odeur nauséabonde, ainsi un peu de folie fait de celui qui est réputé pour sa sagesse et son honneur.\"  **\nC'est pourquoi la Bible dit que vous devez être parfait. Avec toute cette réputation que tu t'es faite, avec tout cet honneur, de voir le péché dans ta vie ? Les gens qui vous connaissaient avant et qui voient votre vie maintenant secoueront la tête. Une femme peut même dire   « Je me tenais à côté du pasteur, mais la façon dont le pasteur me regardait, Hmmmm ! C'est comme ces autres hommes ooo . Que s'est-il passé? Le pasteur ne prie plus. Allez lui demander, quand a-t-il jeûné pour la dernière fois ? Quand le pasteur a-t-il jeûné pour la dernière fois ? Allez lui demander. Quand s'est-il assis pour lire les Écritures ? Allez demander au pasteur. C'est pourquoi même Pastor lui-même a été surpris de la façon dont il a commencé à regarder les femmes avec luxure. Le pasteur lui-même avait peur. Comment ne fera-t-il pas ça ? Il n'y a pas de force spirituelle dans sa vie.  **\n1.5 Beaucoup d'hommes de Dieu n'ont pas le temps de s'occuper d'eux-mêmes  **\nVotre propre vignoble, vous ne le gardez pas. C'est pourquoi le Seigneur vous dit de prendre soin de vous. Prenez bien soin de votre esprit et de votre âme. L'eau est chaude parce qu'il y a du feu en dessous. Mais si le feu est éteint, la chaleur continuera de diminuer par seconde. Beaucoup sont employés ou recrutés dans le ministère et travaillent sans relâche, au service des autres. Ils reçoivent des éloges en tant que serviteurs fidèles, mais négligent de prendre soin d'eux-mêmes. Le résultat est que de petits renards viennent détruire leur droiture et leur sainteté devant Dieu et les hommes. Ils s'engagent comme enseignants de la parole de Dieu, enseignant les autres avec ferveur, mais ils n'ont pas le temps de s'instruire eux-mêmes.  **\nRomains 2 verset 17 à 24  **\n17\tVoici, tu es appelé Juif, et tu te reposes dans la loi, et tu te vantes de Dieu,\n18\tEt connais sa volonté, et approuve les choses les plus excellentes, étant instruit par la loi;\n19\tEt tu as confiance que tu es toi-même un guide pour les aveugles, une lumière pour ceux qui sont dans les ténèbres, un instructeur pour les insensés, un enseignant pour les enfants, qui a la forme de la connaissance et de la vérité dans la loi.\n20\tToi donc qui enseignes un autre, ne t'enseignes-tu pas toi-même ? toi qui prêches qu'un homme ne doit pas voler, voles-tu?\n21\tToi qui dis qu'un homme ne doit pas commettre d'adultère, commets-tu l'adultère ? toi qui as en horreur les idoles, tu commets un sacrilège?\n22\tToi qui te vantes de la loi, en violant la loi tu déshonores Dieu?\n23\tCar le nom de Dieu est blasphémé parmi les païens par vous, comme il est écrit.  **\nC'est votre état maintenant ? Vous avez la forme de la connaissance. Vous connaissez la doctrine. Vous connaissez la Bible. Vous connaissez les versets et les interprétations. Salomon a dit   « Ma sagesse est toujours restée avec moi. Bien que rétrograde, ma sagesse est toujours restée avec moi. Vous avez toujours cette connaissance. En fait, vous savez toujours comment chasser les démons. Vous savez parler la langue. Vous savez devenir sérieux quand il s'agit de démons. Vous savez quoi dire. Vous savez comment conseiller les autres, mais que vous arrive-t-il ? Pourquoi faites-vous les choses contre lesquelles vous prêchez ? tu ne t'occupes pas de toi-même. Vous avez abandonné votre vignoble. Toi qui enseigne les autres, n'enseignes-tu pas toi-même ? \nVous interprétez bien les Écritures aux personnes qui ne les connaissent pas, vous leur donnez donc une connaissance correcte, mais quant à vous, appliquez-vous ces vérités scripturaires à vous-même ? Asseyez-vous et prêchez-vous. Le fils prodigue savait déjà ce que cela signifiait de rentrer chez lui. Il connaissait la route. Tout ce qu'il avait à faire était de se lever et de suivre le chemin du retour. Vous connaissez la route mais vous ne la suivez pas. C'est mauvais. Vous ne vous portez pas bien. Sœur, comment permettez-vous à la cuisine de prendre le contrôle de votre vie ? Ne te plains pas, Marthe ! Vous ne devriez pas parler de travail de cuisine. Qu'il y ait jeûne dans cette maison pendant au moins trois jours afin que vous puissiez avoir du temps pour votre âme. Membres de la famille, si le Seigneur vous demande de jeûner trois jours pour que votre mère aille au ciel, ne jeûnerez-vous pas ?  **\n1.6 Valeur Nourriture de l'âme au-dessus de la nourriture du corps.  **\nLuc 10 verset 40 à 42  **\n40\tMais Marthe était encombrée de beaucoup de service, et vint à lui, et dit   Seigneur, ne te soucies-tu pas que ma sœur me laisse seule pour servir ? dis-lui donc qu'elle m'aide.\n41\tEt Jésus répondit et lui dit   Marthe, Marthe, tu es soucieuse et inquiète de beaucoup de choses ;\n42\tMais une chose est nécessaire et Marie a choisi la bonne part, qui ne lui sera pas ôtée.  **\nQui vous a dit que la vie ne devait se résumer qu'à la nourriture ? N'avez-vous pas pensé à cela par vous-même ? Si vous demandez à Dieu la sagesse, Il vous la donnera. Si vous pouvez bien négocier avec votre famille, vous vous créerez du temps pour prier et chercher le Seigneur. Mais comment en êtes-vous arrivé là ? Comment es-tu tombé du ciel ? Comment? Que tu es devenu comme ça ? Se battre, dire des mensonges et proférer une communication corrompue. Ta colère est comme un lion ou une lionne. Comment en êtes-vous arrivé là ? C'est parce que vous vous êtes négligé. Tu as gardé les vignes des autres, mais ta vigne, tu ne l'as jamais gardée. La folie est venue à vous, que même votre service est une abomination.  **\n1 Corinthiens 13 versets 1 à 3  **\n1\tBien que je parle avec les langues des hommes et des anges, et que je n'aie pas la charité, je suis devenu comme de l'airain qui sonne, ou une cymbale qui tinte.\n2\tEt bien que j'aie le don de prophétie, et que je comprenne tous les mystères et toute connaissance ; et bien que j'aie toute la foi, de sorte que je puisse déplacer des montagnes, et que je n'aie pas la charité, je ne suis rien.\n3\tEt bien que je donne tous mes biens pour nourrir les pauvres, et que je donne mon corps à brûler, et que je n'aie pas la charité, cela ne me profite en rien.  **\nUne petite mouche morte dans l'huile de l'apothicaire fait beaucoup de mal. Le doux parfum de l'huile est détruit lorsqu'il y a une mouche morte dedans. L'huile aura une odeur nauséabonde. Votre huile spirituelle sent mauvais. Les gens voudront retirer leurs yeux et vous montrer leur nez. Belle odeur d'huile ! Pourquoi? Vous ne vous souciez pas de vous-même et la folie s'est abattue sur vous.  **\nOsée 7 verset 8 à 9  **\n8\tÉphraïm, il s'est mêlé au peuple; Éphraïm est un gâteau non retourné.\n9\tDes étrangers ont dévoré sa force, et il ne le sait pas oui, des cheveux gris sont ici et là sur lui, mais il ne le sait pas.  **\nPeux tu voir? Comment c'est arrivé comme ça ? Il s'est mêlé au peuple. Vous avez des amis qui ne sont pas chrétiens. Vous avez des amis qui n'ont pas de vision chrétienne. Vous vous asseyez du matin à l'après-midi, parlez et riez, jusqu'à ce que vos forces s'épuisent. La prochaine chose est d'aller dormir. Ô dormeur ! Et quand tu dors, Ooooh ! Vous avez travaillé à parler, vous avez travaillé à rire, vous dormirez profondément. Vous vous êtes mêlé au peuple. Vous êtes allé rejoindre les gens de la société qui n'ont pas Jésus venant pour eux, qui ne sont pas mandatés par Dieu pour Lui rendre un service quelconque, qui ne savent rien de la vie sainte. Ce sont les gens qui vous ont occupé. Vous êtes allé faire des affaires avec eux. Vous cherchez maintenant de l'argent comme le peuple. Tout le monde court pour l'argent. Vous les avez rejoints. Ainsi, par conséquent, les cheveux gris sont ici et là . La partie inférieure de vous est chrétienne, mais la partie supérieure de vous n'est pas chrétienne. C'est un gâteau non retourné. Le dessous est fait, mais le dessus n'est pas fait, car il n'est pas tourné. C'est Ephraïm ! C'est un gâteau non retourné. Des étrangers ont dévoré sa force . Vous connaissez les étrangers. Les étrangers que tu as amenés à toi, qui ont maintenant dévoré ta force. Frère, vous les connaissez. Quant à nos iniquités, nous les connaissons. Nos péchés et nos transgressions ne sont pas cachés devant nous.  **\n 1.7 Ne soyez pas un hypocrite au service de Dieu  **\nEncore une fois, c'est ce que Dieu veut que vous sachiez. Vous luttez maintenant. Qu'est-ce que tu as du mal à faire ?  **\nMatthieu 7 verset 3 à 5  **\n3\tEt pourquoi vois-tu la paille qui est dans l'œil de ton frère, mais ne considères-tu pas la poutre qui est dans ton œil ?\n4\tOu comment diras-tu à ton frère   Laisse-moi arracher la paille de ton œil ; Et voici, une poutre est dans ton œil ?\n5 Hypocrite, jette d'abord la poutre de ton propre œil; et alors tu verras clair pour ôter la paille de l'oeil de ton frère.  **\nC'est ce que vous faites maintenant. Pourquoi vois-tu la paille dans les yeux des autres ? Vous traitez maintenant les autres. Vous partez en croisade ! Pour aller dire quoi ? Qu'allez-vous dire aux gens de la Croisade ? Je leur dirai de se repentir et de croire en Jésus ! Qu'en est-il de votre style de vie immoral ? Qu'en est-il de votre vie difficile? Voyez comment vous traitez votre femme ! Rugueux. En colère. Ne vous repentirez-vous pas ? Vous allez demander à un autre homme innocent là-bas de se repentir. Vous allez demander à un autre homme, qui peut être meilleur que vous, de se repentir, et vous n'êtes pas de ceux qui se repentent ! Vous êtes juste en train de lutter.  **\nMatthieu 7 verset 4,5  **\n4\tOu comment diras-tu à ton frère   Laisse-moi arracher la paille de ton œil ; Et voici, une poutre est dans ton œil ?\n5\tHypocrite, ôte d'abord la poutre de ton œil; et alors tu verras clair pour ôter la paille de l'oeil de ton frère.  **\nSavez-vous que vous êtes un hypocrite ? Combien de personnes savent vraiment qu'elles sont des hypocrites ? Vous pouvez dire que vous ne l'êtes pas, mais Jésus dit que vous l'êtes. Vous avez un plus gros problème car, pour celui qui connaît la volonté de son Maître et ne la fait pas, il sera battu de plusieurs coups. Vous connaissez la volonté de votre Maître, vous connaissez la parole de votre Maître. Vous savez que votre Maître veut que vous Lui parliez. Vous savez même que votre Maître veut vous parler, mais vous n'avez pas de temps pour Lui. Occupé à d'autres choses. Pas le temps! Oh, frère, prends soin de ton esprit et de ton âme.  **\n1.8 Les programmes chrétiens sont destinés à vous servir. **\nHébreux 10 verset 25  **\n« Ne pas renoncer à nous assembler, comme c'est la manière de certains ; mais en vous exhortant les uns les autres et bien plus encore, à mesure que vous voyez le jour approcher.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 5 verset 11  **\n« C'est pourquoi consolez-vous ensemble et édifiez-vous les uns les autres, comme vous le faites aussi.  **\nLuc 6 verset 31  **\n« Et comme vous voudriez que les hommes vous fassent, faites-leur aussi de même.  **\nPendant les conférences, vous préférez voyager. Faites-vous partie de ceux qui vont au paradis ? Que vous apportera-t-il si vous gagnez le monde entier et perdez votre propre âme ? Ayez la priorité dans la vie et sachez bien définir vos priorités.\nprogrammes chrétiens; les bourses et les conférences doivent nourrir votre âme. Tu as gardé les vignes des autres, mais tu n'as pas gardé ta propre vigne. Vous négligez d'assister à la fraternité, aux conférences et aux autres programmes organisés pour vous servir parce que vous n'allez pas être l'un des prédicateurs. Vous vous êtes programmé pour n'être qu'un chrétien prêchant, pour ne pas être prêché, pour ne pas écouter les autres, pour ne pas lire les livres d'autres écrivains. Comment alors pouvez-vous voir les cheveux gris sur vous dont vous n'êtes pas conscient ? Vous frustrez votre âme. Vous n'avez pas de vision pour le ciel. Vous devez bien définir vos priorités. Vous devez savoir rendre honneur à Dieu. Rendez à César ce qui est à César, et à Dieu ce qui est à Dieu. Sachez que Dieu est infiniment supérieur à César. C'est le temps pour Dieu mais vous ne le Lui donnez pas ? Comment ne pas être noir à l'intérieur ? La vigne des autres que tu as gardée, pour ta propre vigne, pas de temps.\nVous n'écoutez pas les autres vrais serviteurs de Dieu qui vous sont envoyés. Vous pouvez être lié à une dénomination et ruiné par ignorance. Humiliez-vous et recevez la réprimande et la sagesse divines. Chaque fois que vous assistez à des programmes, vous vous plaignez du message et du prédicateur, et vous ne voulez pas vous humilier et écouter comme Jésus l'a fait.  **\nLuc 2 verset 46  **\n\"Et il arriva qu'au bout de trois jours, ils le trouvèrent dans le temple, assis au milieu des docteurs, les écoutant et les interrogeant.\"  **\nIl vaut mieux en ce moment, recevoir que donner. Entraînez-vous à vous asseoir et à écouter la parole de Dieu. En tant que pasteur, vous donnez des livres et des messages enregistrés aux autres pour leur édification, mais vous ne vous asseyez pas pour vous écouter. Vous gardez les vignes des autres, mais pas votre propre vigne. Non! Savez-vous que s'asseoir seul pour écouter ou regarder un message, et se joindre à une congrégation dans un service quand beaucoup de prières ont été priées pour arroser le sol, et lier le diable et plaider pour la présence de Dieu sont deux choses différentes ? Mais vous ne voulez pas vous joindre à la congrégation dans une conférence. C'est pourquoi vous êtes noir dans votre cœur, et Dieu qui sait que vous n'êtes pas sérieux ne s'occupe pas de vous. Il sait que vous n'êtes pas sérieux. Va chez les fourmis, paresseux. Allez apprendre leurs voies et soyez sages ; qui, n'ayant ni guide ni surveillant, font ce qui les fera vivre. Parce que personne n'est là dans votre église, c'est vous qui êtes là et personne ne vous surveille là-bas, alors vous faites ce que vous voulez ? Vous venez à l'église à l'heure que vous voulez, et vous vous asseyez où vous voulez, donnant à la chair sa propre aisance ? Être averti! ** **\n\nCHAPITRE DEUX  **\nPRENEZ BIEN SOIN SPIRITUEL DE VOTRE ESPRIT ET DE VOTRE ÂME  **\n2.1 Ce dont vous avez besoin.  **\n2 Corinthiens 8 versets 1 à 5  **\n1\tDe plus, frères, nous vous faisons connaître la grâce de Dieu accordée aux Églises de Macédoine;\n2\tComment que dans une grande épreuve d'affliction l'abondance de leur joie et leur profonde pauvreté a abondé à la richesse de leur libéralité.\n3\tCar je rends témoignage à leur pouvoir, oui, et au-delà de leur pouvoir, ils étaient volontaires d'eux-mêmes;\n4\tNous priant avec beaucoup d'insistance que nous recevions le don et que nous prenions sur nous la communion du ministère auprès des saints.\n5\tEt ce qu'ils ont fait, pas comme nous l'espérions, mais ils ont d'abord donné eux-mêmes au Seigneur, et à nous par le volonté de Dieu .  **\nRelisez le verset 5 - Et cela, ils ne l'ont pas fait comme nous l'espérions, mais se sont d'abord donnés eux-mêmes au Seigneur, et à nous par la volonté de Dieu .\nOn vous a dit qu'en ce qui concerne les choses du ciel, pour votre vie individuelle, il vaut mieux recevoir que donner. Mais s'il s'agit d'argent ou de choses matérielles, il vaut mieux donner que recevoir. Pour les choses spirituelles, il vaut mieux recevoir que donner. Regardez ces gens; ils ont soutenu Paul même dans leur état de pauvreté. Ils se sont d'abord donnés à Dieu. Ils se souciaient d'abord de leur vie spirituelle ; et c'est ce qu'ils ont fait.  **\n2.2 Donnez-vous d'abord au Seigneur.  **\nLe peuple s'est d'abord donné au Seigneur. Prédicateurs, apprenons à nous donner d'abord au Seigneur. Apprenons à chercher d'abord le Seigneur pour nous-mêmes. Apprenons à recevoir d'abord la chaleur spirituelle du Seigneur pour nous-mêmes. Apprenons d'abord à avoir une communion avec le Seigneur pour nous-mêmes, puis nous pourrons aller au service et à la prédication. « Ils se sont d'abord donnés eux-mêmes au Seigneur et à nous pour le ministère.\nLes croyants macédoniens étaient zélés pour l'œuvre de Dieu. Ils ont soutenu le travail du ministère. Le témoignage de Paul était que ces personnes ont d'abord donné leur propre vie à Christ, et de façon quotidienne, se sont engagées envers le Seigneur, puis au ministère de Paul avec des preuves. Avant de rendre service, la repentance et le salut du péché par la foi en Christ vous sont demandés. Alors que vous nourrissez les autres dans le service chrétien, souvenez-vous de nourrir votre âme et votre esprit avec la parole de Dieu.  **\nMatthieu 4 verset 4  **\n\"Mais il répondit et dit   Il est écrit   L'homme ne vivra pas de pain seulement, mais de toute parole qui sort de la bouche de Dieu.\"    **\nLisez la Bible, c'est chaque parole de Dieu. Nourrissez-vous-en d'abord et vivez-en; chaque parole de Dieu. Lisez la Bible et lisez-y les révélations de Dieu, ce sont les paroles de Dieu. Je veux dire des révélations vraies et prouvées.  **\nApocalypse 1 verset 1 à 3  **\n1\tLa révélation de Jésus-Christ, que Dieu lui a donnée, pour montrer à ses serviteurs des choses qui doivent bientôt arriver; et il l'envoya et le signifia par son ange à son serviteur Jean;\n2\tqui a rendu témoignage de la parole de Dieu, du témoignage de Jésus-Christ et de tout ce qu'il a vu.\n3\tHeureux celui qui lit et ceux qui entendent les paroles de cette prophétie et gardent ce qui y est écrit car le temps est proche.  **\nLa connaissance grandit. Je vous écris maintenant, après un certain temps, lorsque vous vous assiérez pour relire ce livre, vous vous demanderez si vous l'avez déjà lu. La parole de Dieu ne peut s'épuiser, car elle se renouvelle chaque matin. C'est ça. Étudiez le mot, retournez-y et étudiez le mot encore et encore.\nLisez des livres chrétiens. Dieu leur a donné. Ne vous en lassez pas. Ah ! Pourquoi lisons-nous tous les jours les livres du pasteur Paul Rika ? C'est le langage de la multitude mixte. Ils sont fatigués de la manne, nourriture divine du ciel ! Ils recherchent celui d'Egypte. Ils recherchent des prédicateurs de la prospérité. Ils recherchent aussi ces autres prédicateurs. Quant à cette manne que Dieu lui-même donne, ils ont dit   « Nous sommes fatigués de cette manne » . C'est la voix d'un rétrograde. Le Seigneur est Celui qui vous a donné ces messages. Le Seigneur est Celui qui organise ce mouvement de réveil de la sainteté et vous place dans des zones, des chapitres et des unités. Vous devriez lire et écouter ces messages. Il les a envoyés. Ne vous en lassez pas. Ne les dédaignez pas comme les enfants rétrogrades d'Israël ont dédaigné la manne du ciel. Renouvelez-vous par eux. Laissez-les vous rafraîchir.  **\n2.3 Mettez la pression sur vous-même et sur les autres sur des questions spirituelles   **\nChaque parole de Dieu vit pour toujours.   **\nPsaumes 119 verset 89  **\n\"Pour toujours, ô Éternel, ta parole est établie dans les cieux .\"    **\nSi vous deveniez fatigué de la Bible, que feriez-vous ? Voulez-vous maintenant lire le Coran ou les 7 livres de Moïse ? Si vous dites que vous êtes fatigué de la Bible, alors vous êtes fatigué de Dieu. Réprimandez cette chair dans votre vie et soyez spirituel. Prenez bien soin de votre esprit et de votre âme. Observez votre temps de silence avec Dieu. Prenez suffisamment de temps pour être avec Dieu. Si vous êtes trop occupé le matin, créez du temps à une autre période. Même dans votre bureau, vous pouvez y créer du temps. Si vous le désirez, Dieu vous aidera.\nJe me souviens quand j'étais employé de bureau, comment je marchais sur une longue distance, aller et venir, priant sur le chemin, parce que je ne pouvais pas prier dans le bureau. j'ai fait la marche de la prière; au moment où je suis arrivé là-bas et que j'ai prié en retour, j'avais obtenu un bon moment de prière pendant les heures de bureau. C'était la sagesse. Faites tout votre possible pour vous sauver. Prenez des engagements spirituels personnels. Je me souviens aussi qu'une fois, je me suis dit que j'allais écouter quatre messages DVD par jour pendant une semaine. Cet engagement était lourd. Il m'a fallu jusqu'à minuit. Cela m'a obligé à me discipliner à rester debout longtemps pour m'assurer que je ne dormais pas. Parce qu'en dehors des autres occupations de la vie, je m'y étais engagé. Comme Jephté, Oh ! Je m'étais engagé et je ne pouvais pas reculer. J'ai écouté 28 messages en une semaine. Allez prendre un engagement similaire ; fais de ton mieux.  **\nLe Seigneur m'a dit de confier aux dirigeants et aux membres du Holiness Revival Movement des missions spirituelles. Comme ils finissent cela, je devrais leur en donner un autre. Ne jouez pas avec eux. Prenez-les au sérieux. « Je vous les ai livrés pour les conduire au ciel. Êtes-vous paresseux pour les devoirs? La sagesse de Dieu joue sur vous, ne résistez pas à l'esprit de sagesse. Êtes-vous prêt à aller au ciel ? Nous suivons les missions. Ne donnez pas d'excuses à Dieu pour ne pas faire ces missions conçues pour vous aider contre le péché et Satan. Si vous ne pouvez pas faire ce qui vous gardera en tant que leader spirituellement fort, alors comment nourrissez-vous les gens ? Dieu a dit que je devrais vous donner cette mission. Ne pense pas que tu le fais pour moi. Vous le faites pour Dieu. Il vous jugera pour cela, si vous jouez à la paresse. Nous n'avons pas de temps à perdre. Nos pères ont perdu assez de temps, et le Seigneur vient déjà. Alors, quelle que soit la mission spirituelle qu'Il vous a confiée, levez-vous et faites-la. Il est patient avec vous, mais ne faites pas défaut.  **\nVotre nature humaine est faible, c'est pourquoi nous vous donnons un coup de pouce. Planifiez votre temps de prière. Observez le jeûne et les veilles. Joignez-vous aux autres dans des activités et des exercices spirituels. Dirigeants, lorsque les membres de votre Église prient, rejoignez-les. N'allez pas vous asseoir au bureau. Que fais-tu au bureau ? Êtes-vous le seul à pouvoir dormir ? Êtes-vous le seul à être fatigué ? Savez-vous d'où viennent ces membres ? Pourquoi les pressurisez-vous pour le ciel, alors que vous vous éloignez et évitez la fatigue ? Sachez que Dieu vous voit ! Allez au milieu d'eux et souffrez-le aussi comme ils souffrent; car ce sont des êtres humains comme vous. Allez parmi eux et forcez-vous à prier. Si vous sentez que vous pouvez vous endormir, allez vous endormir devant eux, ils comprendront. Comme vous leur donnez des raisons pour lesquelles ils ne devraient pas s'assoupir, donnez-vous aussi les mêmes raisons. Pratiquez ces choses qui vous feront ne pas somnoler. Prier! Le Seigneur m'a dit  \"Quand les gens prient, assurez-vous de vous joindre à eux, vous et votre femme.\" Ne jouez pas à l'hypocrisie comme les autres. Ne poussez pas les autres vers Dieu et restez en arrière ; le Seigneur veille. \"Ce n'est pas la quantité de prière que vous priez, c'est Dieu qui fait miséricorde, disent certains chrétiens paresseux.\" Comment te fera-t-il miséricorde, s'il te juge infidèle ? Dieu veut que vous travailliez dans la prière afin qu'il vous donne la récompense. Gérez bien votre famille spirituellement. Donnez-leur une poussée vers Dieu.  **\n2.4 Condition(s) pour que les promesses de Dieu soient accomplies.  **\n \nGenèse 18 verset 17 à 19  **\n17\tEt l'Éternel dit  Cacherai-je à Abraham ce que je fais?\n18\tVoyant qu'Abraham deviendra sûrement une nation grande et puissante, et que toutes les nations de la terre seront bénies en lui ?\n19\tCar je le connais, qu'il commandera à ses enfants et à sa maison après lui, et qu'ils garderont le chemin de l'Éternel, pour pratiquer la justice et le jugement; afin que l'Éternel fasse venir sur Abraham ce qu'il a dit de lui.  **\nDieu a-t-il bien parlé de vous concernant ce qu'il fera ? Dieu vous assure-t-il un futur merveilleux ? Il a dit   « Je connais Abraham, sa famille, ses enfants, sa maison. Si vous vous soumettez à votre femme et lui permettez de vous gouverner, votre ministère est parti et vous n'avez aucune raison d'expliquer pourquoi vous avez échoué. Qu'allez-vous dire à Dieu ? Il a dit que vous devriez commander . Il a mis l'autorité en Abraham, pour leur commander. Pour quelle raison? Commandez-leur la spiritualité dans cette maison. Il est nécessaire pour votre propre progression ministérielle. Votre progression ministérielle est plus que la nourriture que votre femme vous donne. Si elle vous donne de la nourriture parce qu'elle veut que vous viviez, elle devrait se soumettre à votre autorité spirituelle dans cette maison, afin que vous viviez aussi spirituellement et 'ministériellement'. Enseignez-leur la parole, amenez-les à la dévotion dans cette famille - enfants, femme et tout ce qui s'y trouve. Commandez-leur d'obéir et de suivre le Seigneur pour les bénédictions de Dieu sur vous.  **\n2.5 Démon des épouses de pasteurs.  ** \nFemmes de pasteurs ! Il y a des démons appelés, les démons des épouses de pasteurs. Quand ces démons viennent à l'église, ils ne s'intéressent qu'aux épouses des pasteurs   les faire venir en retard, les faire asseoir au fond ou sous un arbre. Les faire se lever et se déplacer négligemment, dormir ou s'absenter. Démon des épouses de pasteurs. Examinez chaque femme de pasteur pour savoir si elle a des démons ! Quels sont les signes ? Esprit d'arrivée tardive et esprit d'occupation ici et là. Comme ton serviteur était occupé ici et là , la vie spirituelle avait disparu. « Marthe ! Marthe ! Vous vous inquiétez de beaucoup de choses, mais une chose est nécessaire, Marie l'a choisie, et elle ne lui sera jamais ôtée. Vous êtes occupé à dire   « Maître, mangez. En fait, la raison d'être occupé est de prendre soin de vous. Jésus a jeûné pendant 40 jours. Pourquoi accorder plus d'attention à la nourriture qu'à la spiritualité ? Pourquoi ne vous êtes-vous pas levé tôt ? Vous devez planifier votre chemin et créer du temps pour Dieu dans votre vie. Pourquoi ne le faites-vous pas ? Maintenant, vous apportez le blasphème au ministère de votre mari. Vous rendez votre mari faible dans la chaire. Dieu vous tiendra responsable ! Dieu et les démons sont au-dessus de vous. Dieu veut vous gagner, car s'il réussit en vous, votre mari aura un avenir béni dans le ministère comme il l'a dit à Abraham. Sinon, votre ministère auprès des femmes, tous les sourires que vous mettez sur votre visage et l'amitié que vous pensez nouer avec les femmes ne dureront jamais,\nparce que la vraie spiritualité est l'état de votre cœur. Vous ne lisez pas ou n'étudiez pas la parole de Dieu, vous n'avez pas à prier pour recevoir la grâce de Dieu pour son service parce que vous n'avez pas le temps. Tu as gardé les vignes des autres, tu n'as pas gardé ta propre vigne.  **\n2.6 Dirigeants, prenez soin de vos épouses.  **\nLes épouses de certains ministres négligent la fraternité ou les services religieux, les programmes spéciaux ou les conférences. Ils ne prennent pas la peine d'assister à des réunions qui les édifieront. Ils se comportent comme des incroyants et ne se soucient pas de Dieu et de leurs âmes. Mais vous dites qu'elle est croyante et qu'elle ne vient pas pour la communion des croyants ! Quelles raisons pouvez-vous donner pour son absence régulière ? Si vous nous donnez une raison aujourd'hui, nous pouvons dire, d'accord, c'est peut-être ce qui l'a fait ne pas venir aujourd'hui. Quelle raison pouvez-vous donner à son absence demain puisqu'elle est devenue un personnage ? Nous attendons d'elle qu'elle trouve une solution. Sinon, votre femme est-elle plus occupée que ces autres femmes ? Votre femme a-t-elle plus d'enfants que les autres femmes ? Pourquoi est-elle arriérée ? N'est-ce pas à cause du démon des épouses de pasteurs ?\nMieux vaut prendre soin de votre femme. Utilisez l'autorité et le commandement. Aidez-la dans tous les domaines où elle a besoin d'aide. Faites tout ce qui est nécessaire pour l'aider spirituellement. Ne perdez pas cette âme. Le Seigneur vous demandera d'elle. Si vous faites de votre mieux et que vous échouez, alors, comme John Wesley, laissez le Seigneur en être témoin. Dieu veut que vous et votre femme exerciez la piété ensemble.  **\nPremier Timothée 3 verset 1 à 7  **\n1\tC'est un vrai dicton   Si un homme désire l'office d'évêque, il désire une bonne œuvre.\n2\tUn évêque doit donc être irréprochable, époux d'une seule femme, vigilant, sobre, de bonne conduite, hospitalier, apte à enseigner ;\n3\tPas adonné au vin, pas gréviste, pas avide de vils lucres ; mais patient, pas bagarreur, pas cupide ;\n4\tCelui qui gouverne bien sa propre maison, ayant ses enfants soumis avec toute gravité;\n5\t(Car si un homme ne sait pas gouverner sa propre maison, comment prendra-t-il soin de l'église de\nDieu?)\n6\tPas un novice, de peur d'être élevé avec orgueil, il tombe dans la condamnation du diable.\n7\tDe plus, il doit avoir un bon rapport de ceux qui sont sans ; de peur qu'il ne tombe dans l'opprobre et le piège du diable.  **\nLes épouses des dirigeants chrétiens doivent être justes et saintes et être sous le contrôle de leurs maris. Femmes de pasteurs, s'il vous plaît, n'apportez pas de défauts au ministère. Ne vous comportez pas de manière contraire dans vos maisons à propos de cet appel spécial que le Seigneur vous a donné à vous et à votre mari, sinon ce sera terrible pour vous devant Dieu. Ne sois pas maître de toi-même, tu es sous ton mari et le Seigneur lui a demandé de t'ordonner de faire ce qui est spirituellement juste à ses yeux. Soumettez-vous à lui à la maison et soumettez-vous également à lui dans le ministère. Ne soyez pas un perpétuel retardataire.\nSi vous arrivez en retard aujourd'hui pour une raison quelconque, il peut y avoir de vraies raisons, mais évitez les retards la prochaine fois. Entraînez vos enfants à venir tôt à l'église. Si vous devez déléguer des tâches à d'autres, faites-le. Les frères veulent vous voir tôt à l'église et à chaque réunion. Vous avez été averti que votre nom pourrait être retiré du Livre de Vie ou même ne pas y entrer si vous n'êtes pas juste et saint. Aimez la sainteté. Rejoignez votre mari dans le travail. Soignez bien la famille. Rendez la famille propice au ministère chrétien. Que vous deux vous occupiez bien des enfants pour qu'ils aiment Dieu.  ** **\n\n\nCHAPITRE TROIS  **\nSOIGNEZ BIEN VOTRE CORPS PHYSIQUE  **\n \n3.1 Le corps physique doit également être préservé sans reproche.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 5 verset 23  **\n« Et le Dieu même de la paix vous sanctifie entièrement ; et je prie Dieu que tout ton esprit, ton âme et ton corps soient préservés sans reproche jusqu'à la venue de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.  **\n\nVotre corps physique, c'est-à-dire votre chair, est celui qui vous recouvre. Touchez votre corps pour savoir et comprendre ce que cela signifie. Votre corps physique est indispensable. Louez le Seigneur pour cela. La Bible dit que vous devez préserver ce corps. Dieu veut que ce corps soit préservé. Beaucoup de gens sont morts avant leur temps parce qu'ils ne se souciaient pas du corps. Ils n'ont jamais prêté attention au bien-être de leur corps. Dieu est intéressé à ce que votre corps soit préservé de tout reproche, sans maladie, dommage ou toute condition qui puisse empêcher votre âme et votre esprit de rendre à Dieu une adoration et un service complets. Un corps endommagé ou malade peut vous faire mourir prématurément ou vous inhiber spirituellement.  **\n\n3.2 Nourrissez et chérissez votre corps.  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 29  **\n« Car personne n'a encore haï sa propre chair ; mais le nourrit et le chérit, comme le Seigneur l'Église   »  **\n\nNe détestez pas votre corps. Ne faites aucun mal à ce corps. Nourrissez ce corps et nourrissez-le bien. Nourrissez votre corps avec de la bonne nourriture et tout ce qui est bon pour le corps pour le rendre sain, pour le rendre sain, pour en éliminer la douleur et la maladie, prenez-le et gardez votre corps en bonne santé. Prospérez en santé, chérissez ce corps et nourrissez-le. Ne soyez pas négligent là-dessus. N'exposez pas ce corps au danger. N'exposez pas ce corps à des dommages. Gardez-le bien. Gardez-le en bonne santé. Dieu le veut ainsi. Bien que l'esprit soit celui qui renaît; pour vivre dans ce monde, ce corps est essentiel. Cela peut mettre fin à l'activité de votre esprit et renvoyer votre esprit et votre âme dans l'éternité, si vous ne vous en occupez pas bien. Veuillez prendre soin de votre corps car la vie est dans le sang. Votre corps contient votre vie sur terre.  ** \n\n3.3 Votre corps est un bâtiment.  **\n\nLa personne principale dans ce bâtiment est vous-même, mais le bâtiment est important car il joue son propre rôle, sinon comment serez-vous caché du soleil ? Comment serez-vous à l'abri du vent et de la pluie ? Comment serez-vous protégé des mauvais ouvriers et des hommes mauvais ? Comment aurez-vous un vrai repos sans maison? Votre corps est votre maison. Si votre corps est endommagé, cela affectera vos parties intérieures et l'ennemi pourrait en profiter pour affecter votre spiritualité. C'est pourquoi certains voleurs, lorsqu'ils veulent entrer pour opérer contre vous, doivent percer la maison, et certains vont creuser de l'extérieur et creuser le mur de la maison. Alors, soyez très prudent et surveillez votre corps. C'est pourquoi certains ont des gardiens sur leurs maisons. Un grand homme vivant à l'intérieur de sa maison emploie des gardiens pour surveiller la maison. En fait, ils ne surveillent pas la maison mais veillent sur lui et les membres de sa famille ou d'autres habitants de la maison car, si les ennemis pénètrent dans la maison, ils y auront accès. Votre corps peut inhiber certaines activités spirituelles dans votre vie ou même mettre fin à votre vie sur terre. Par conséquent, Dieu vous demande de prendre soin de votre corps.\n\nVous devez avoir des connaissances sur les choses et les moyens nécessaires pour préserver votre corps. Les connaissances ont augmenté, c'est pourquoi nous voulons que vous compreniez la place des médicaments dans l'entretien de votre corps en tant que saint croyant afin de bien vivre et de sonner tout le temps, pour une vie prolongée et un service à Dieu sur cette terre.  **\n\n Proverbes 3 verset 13 à 24  **\n13 Heureux l'homme qui trouve la sagesse, et l'homme qui acquiert l'intelligence.\n14 Car sa marchandise vaut mieux que la marchandise d'argent, et son gain que l'or fin.\n15 Elle est plus précieuse que les rubis et tout ce que tu peux désirer ne lui est pas comparable.\n16 La durée des jours est dans sa main droite ; et dans sa main gauche richesse et honneur. 17 Ses voies sont des voies agréables, et tous ses sentiers sont paisibles.\n18 Elle est un arbre de vie pour ceux qui s'emparent d'elle et heureux est quiconque la retient.\n19 L'Éternel a fondé la terre avec sagesse; par l'intelligence il a établi les cieux.\n20 Par sa connaissance, les profondeurs se brisent, et les nuages laissent tomber la rosée.\n21 Mon fils, ne les laisse pas s'éloigner de tes yeux, garde une saine sagesse et discrétion;\n22\tainsi seront-ils la vie de ton âme et la grâce de ton cou.\n23Alors tu marcheras en sécurité dans ta voie, et ton pied ne chancellera pas. 24 Quand tu te coucheras, tu n'auras pas peur oui, tu te coucheras, et ton sommeil sera doux.  **\n\nSi vous avez un estomac dérangeant qui ne vous a pas quitté avec toutes vos prières et d'autres qui prient pour vous, et que vous ne prenez pas de médicaments pour l'arrêter dans votre corps, vous ne pourrez pas vous lever ou vous tenir debout dans la chaire avec des morsures ou des maux d'estomac. mal. Vous aurez envie d'aller vous allonger à plat ventre. Vous ne pourrez rien faire car votre corps a été affecté. Que se passe-t-il si un accident se produit et qu'ils doivent vous amputer la jambe ? Frère, automatiquement, beaucoup de choses concernant l'évangile seront limitées dans votre vie. Que se passerait-il si vous deviez perdre vos yeux à cause de la cataracte qui apparaît dans vos yeux et que vous n'avez pas pris la peine d'aller consulter ? Votre utilité dans la vie sera limitée. Et si vous perdez vos dents ? Est-ce une bonne chose quand quelqu'un parle debout et que les dents ne sont pas en ordre ? Seul un nombre limité de personnes voudraient vous écouter. Certaines personnes peuvent facilement être irritées même par de petites choses ou une apparence démesurées. Vous réduirez ainsi le nombre de l'assemblée qui vous entendra. Prenez soin de ce corps. Gardez-le bien. Faites ce qui est juste et juste pour le garder parfait.  **\n\n3.4 Nourrissez votre corps avec de la bonne nourriture et des boissons appropriées.  **\n\nNourrissez votre corps avec des aliments appropriés pour votre bonne santé. Soyez prudent avec le jeûne. Contrôlez votre jeûne. Que votre modération soit connue de tous les hommes. C'est la parole de Dieu. Ne vous engagez pas dans un jeûne inconsidéré. Ne soyez pas si poussé au pouvoir au point de détruire votre corps. Il y a des formules pour tout dans la vie. Tout ce qu'un homme sème, il le récoltera. Soumettez ce corps à une condition défavorable et vous récolterez. Un pasteur particulier a dit qu'il avait fini tout son jeûne ! Je lui ai demandé comment il avait terminé son jeûne. Il a expliqué qu'il avait fait un marathon de jeûne en tant que jeune prédicateur jusqu'à ce qu'un ulcère à l'estomac l'attrape, et donc pour cela, il a terminé tout son jeûne ! Les démons ont-ils aussi terminé leur travail ? Pourquoi avez-vous terminé votre jeûne si tôt ? Les problèmes de la vie sont-ils terminés ? Que votre modération soit connue de tous les hommes.  **\n\nActes 27 verset 33 à 36  **\n33 Et comme le jour venait, Paul les pria tous de prendre de la nourriture, en disant   Aujourd'hui est le quatorzième jour où vous tardez et continuez à jeûner, n'ayant rien pris.\n34 C'est pourquoi je vous prie de prendre de la viande, car c'est pour votre santé ; car il ne tombera pas un cheveu de la tête d'aucun de vous.\n35 Et ayant ainsi parlé, il prit du pain, et rendit grâces à Dieu en présence de tous, et après l'avoir rompu, il se mit à manger.\n36 Alors ils furent tous de bonne humeur, et ils prirent aussi de la viande.  **\n\nPaul a dit que manger était nécessaire pour leur santé. Si vous affamez toujours votre corps, vous en récolterez les conséquences plus tard. Certaines personnes peuvent avoir un accident aujourd'hui sans ressentir la douleur jusqu'à 40 ans ou bien plus tard, lorsqu'elles vont chez le médecin pour se plaindre et que le médecin commence à demander   « Avez-vous déjà eu un accident ? L'accident que vous avez eu il y a de nombreuses années est ce qui se manifeste maintenant dans votre corps ». Oh! Si vous aviez été sage à ce moment-là, vous n'auriez pas négligé cette question. Si vous vous étiez bien traité alors, le défi actuel ne serait pas venu.\n\nSavez-vous que si vous ne prenez pas soin de votre corps aujourd'hui, cela pourrait être la raison de votre rechute demain ? Certaines maladies peuvent survenir chez certaines personnes si douloureuses qu'elles commencent à abuser de Dieu. N'est-ce pas à cause de la maladie de Job que la femme a dit   \"Maudis Dieu et meurs ?\" Bien que nous soyons conscients que Job n'était pas malade parce qu'il était négligent, mais cela concernait son corps. Si Job n'était pas interné, le cas de sa maladie suffisait à le mettre en colère contre Dieu. Que faites-vous dans vos premières années pour prendre soin de votre corps ? Attendez-vous le moment où vous vieillirez et que le corps prendra une autre forme à cause de la façon dont vous le traitiez autrefois ? Ne direz-vous pas alors   « Dieu, j'ai travaillé pour toi, pourquoi as-tu permis cela ? Rappelez-vous que tout ce qu'un homme sème, il le récoltera. Vous n'avez pas bien semé pour votre corps, c'est pourquoi vous récoltez cela; et maintenant vous voulez mettre le blâme sur Dieu ? N'avez-vous pas entendu sa parole ? Mon peuple périt par manque de connaissance.   **\n\nÉvitez les entreprises risquées qui apporteront une mauvaise santé à votre corps et affecteront vos performances plus tard dans la vie. Certaines entreprises vous donneront de l'asthme. Cela ne se verra peut-être pas dans votre corps maintenant, mais plus tard, cela se verra et vous donnera envie de blâmer Dieu pour votre santé et vos incapacités. Vérifiez-le maintenant. Étude! Prenez le temps d'écouter; être rapide à entendre. Lorsque nous enseignons ces conseils de santé, ne dites pas que vous n'en avez pas besoin ou que vous avez une foi solide en Dieu. Il y a le lieu de la foi et il y a le lieu de la connaissance. Ajoutez à votre foi, la connaissance. Vous en avez besoin. Qu'il y ait modération ou maîtrise de soi en tout.  **\n\nDeuxième Pierre 1 verset 5  **\n« Et à côté de cela, donnant toute diligence, ajoutez à votre foi la vertu ; et à la connaissance de la vertu ; »    **\n \nOn dit aux ivrognes que leur ulcère à l'estomac est le résultat d'une consommation excessive d'alcool. Avez-vous entendu cela? On dit aux fumeurs que le cancer de leurs poumons est le résultat de la fumée qu'ils y envoient. Vérifiez vos habitudes; vos habitudes alimentaires. Est-ce que vous mangez trop d'une chose ? Découvrez s'il y a implication, bien que vous l'aimiez.  **\n\n 3.5 Jésus a appris à ses disciples à se reposer  **\n Que votre modération soit connue de tous les hommes. Ayez de la maîtrise de soi et de la tempérance. Donnez du repos au corps après un long travail acharné. Jésus a enseigné cela à ses disciples.  **\n\nMarc 6 verset 30 à 32  **\n30 Et les apôtres se rassemblèrent auprès de Jésus, et lui racontèrent tout, tant ce qu'ils avaient fait que ce qu'ils avaient enseigné.\n31 Et il leur dit   Venez à l'écart dans un lieu désert, et reposez-vous un peu, car il y avait beaucoup d'allants et de venues, et ils n'avaient même pas le loisir de manger.\n32 Et ils partirent dans un lieu désert par bateau, en privé.  **\n\n Dieu soit loué pour ce que le Saint-Esprit nous enseigne. Vous allez être fructueux. Vous allez être prospère. Celui qui connaît la vérité sera libéré. Votre avenir est certain. Le poison qui vous attendait dans le futur a été supprimé. La vérité vous rendra libre. Venez-vous juste d'un devoir? Prenez le temps de vous reposer. Le reste peut ne pas être trop long à la fois, mais vous avez besoin de repos. Regardez ce que dit la Bible   'loisirs'. Cela signifie faire quelque chose qui détendra votre cœur, qui procurera à votre esprit joie et paix. Certains peuvent simplement aller s'asseoir au bord d'une rivière et regarder couler l'eau. C'est le loisir. Vous avez quitté la prédication ? Vous n'êtes pas parti pour l'évangélisation; quelqu'un peut demander? Je suis revenu de l'évangélisation et je veux récupérer. C'est pourquoi je suis assis près de cette rivière pour observer la création de Dieu. Je prends plaisir à regarder la création de Dieu et cela me donne du loisir ; est votre réponse à lui. C'est ce que le Seigneur attend de vous. Soyez libre de le faire ; ou bien, tu vas t'asseoir dans un jardin, près des fleurs et tu te reposes. Pour certains, il peut y avoir un beau tapis dans leur maison, ils s'allongent simplement tranquillement sur le tapis et se détendent. Il est heureux. Certains vont s'asseoir sous le climatiseur pour profiter de l'air frais. C'est le loisir. Certains ont de bonnes choses à regarder qui les excitent. C'est le loisir. Tout le monde a ce qui l'intéresse, dans la mesure où de telles choses ne sont pas coupables. Vous en avez besoin pour récupérer, pour vous rafraîchir. Bien sûr, vous pouvez aussi discuter ou parler avec quelqu'un. C'est le loisir. \"Tout le travail et pas de jeu, fait de Jack un garçon ennuyeux\". Un travail constant sans repos ni détente est vraiment nocif pour la vie personnelle et le bien-être. Cette information est utile, de sorte que lorsqu'une personne est en loisirs, elle ne sera pas considérée comme une perte de temps. Vous pouvez entrer dans la maison de quelqu'un et voir de belles chaises coussin et la façon dont il a décoré la maison avec des fleurs et d'autres choses de beauté. Ne dites pas, Hé! \"Les gens peuvent gaspiller l'argent de Dieu\". Dieu nous a donné gratuitement toutes choses pour que nous en jouissions. La personne qui regarde ces choses a du temps libre pour lui permettre de récupérer et de retourner au travail. Il n'y a ni péché ni iniquité à le faire.  **\n\nPremier Timothée 6 verset 17  **\n« Recommande aux riches de ce monde de ne pas être élevés d'esprit, ni de se fier à des richesses incertaines, mais au Dieu vivant, qui nous donne richement toutes choses pour en jouir » ;  **\n\nDeutéronome 8 verset 12, 17,18  **\n12 De peur que tu n'aies mangé et que tu sois rassasié, et que tu aies bâti de belles maisons, et que tu y aies habité;\n17 Et tu dis en ton cœur   Ma puissance et la force de ma main m'ont acquis cette richesse.\n18 Mais tu te souviendras de l'Éternel, ton Dieu, car c'est lui qui te donne le pouvoir d'acquérir des richesses, afin qu'il puisse établir son alliance qu'il a jurée à tes pères, comme il en est aujourd'hui.  **\n\nParfois, les gens peuvent se détendre en faisant du sport comme le badminton à la maison avec les enfants ou avec des amis. C'est un loisir qui dénoue les tensions et détend le corps. Ne montrez pas vos connaissances limitées en disant   « Eh ! Je suis allé chez lui et je l'ai vu jouer au badminton. Ô Chrétiens de nos jours ! Jésus a enseigné à ses disciples le repos et la relaxation pour reprendre des forces.  **\n3.6 Évitez les lieux et les activités à risque.  **\nÉvitez les lieux et les activités dangereuses et prenez des précautions pour votre âme. Ne dites pas que vous avez assez de foi.  **\nJean 7 verset 1 à 9  **\n1 Après ces choses, Jésus marcha en Galilée car il ne voulait pas marcher dans la communauté juive, parce que les Juifs cherchaient à le faire mourir.\n2 Or la fête des tabernacles des Juifs était proche.\n3 Ses frères lui dirent donc   Va d'ici, et va en Judée, afin que tes disciples aussi voient les oeuvres que tu fais.\n4Car il n'y a personne qui fasse quelque chose en secret, et lui-même cherche à être connu ouvertement. Si tu fais ces choses, montre-toi au monde.\n5Car ses frères non plus n'ont pas cru en lui.\n6 Alors Jésus leur dit   Mon temps n'est pas encore venu, mais votre temps est toujours prêt.\n7 Le monde ne peut pas te haïr ; mais moi, il me hait, parce que j'en témoigne, que ses oeuvres sont mauvaises.\n8 Montez à cette fête, je ne monte pas encore à cette fête ; car Mon temps n'est pas encore venu.\n9 Quand il leur eut dit ces paroles, il demeura encore en Galilée.  **\n\nIl existe de nombreux endroits, activités et plans auxquels vous devez faire attention. Par exemple, il faut faire attention aux trajets de nuit car c'est toujours très risqué, à la fois à cause des voleurs et des accidents. Vous pouvez dire que le Seigneur prendra soin ! Assurément, Il le fera. Si vous êtes persuadé de le faire, allez-y. Mais si on vous dit qu'une route particulière est risquée la nuit, s'il vous plaît, restez en arrière et continuez votre voyage le matin. Apprenez de Jésus. Il ne se contenterait pas de se porter aux pharisiens pour être lapidé et tué. Alors, il n'aurait pas terminé l'œuvre qui l'a amené sur la terre. Alors soyez conscient de la sécurité.\n\nVous pouvez dire   « Je ne me soucie pas de boire ou de manger une chose mortelle parce que Jésus a dit, cela ne me fera pas de mal ! Oui, mais pas dans votre orgueil et votre insouciance. Cette mangue, est-elle lavée ? Mon estomac le sanctifiera, dis-tu ! Mais vous prenez des risques. Le diable dit à Jésus   Jette-toi de cette haute montagne, car il est écrit   Il donnera à ses anges la charge de toi. Quelle est la réponse que Jésus a donnée ? Tu ne tenteras pas le Seigneur ton Dieu. Cette promesse est donnée pour des circonstances que vous ne pouvez pas contrôler et que Dieu connaît. Il activera sa promesse et sa puissance, mais pas pour la négligence dans les activités, l'hygiène et la consommation de nourriture sans prudence ni prière.  **\n\nLes dirigeants ne devraient pas simplement choisir une personne ou une femme pour cuisiner pour les ministres de Dieu. Sachez que nous avons des ennemis dans ce service évangélique. Ne choisissez aucune femme qui se porte volontaire ou qui se transmet ! Certains de ces sorciers et sorciers sont très directs. Ils diront « c'est moi qui m'occuperai de la nourriture des ministres ». Vous pouvez penser que c'est dans la justice, mais ce n'est pas le cas. Vous devez très bien prier. Votre femme est-elle vraiment qualifiée pour cuisiner pour les ministres ? Cette femme qui se dispute tout le temps avec toi à la maison veut cuisiner pour les ministres ? Sous quelle onction ? Vérifiez bien et ne soyez pas négligent. N'exposez pas les ministres de Dieu au danger et ne vous exposez pas les uns les autres au danger. Ne tentez pas le Seigneur votre Dieu. Réveillez-vous à la compréhension et à la prudence.  **\n\n3.7 La sagesse est profitable à diriger.  **\n\nSi vous êtes malade, priez Dieu de vous guérir. Si vous voyez que cela persiste, vous pouvez appeler les anciens pour qu'ils prient pour vous. Le cas échéant, vous pouvez consulter un médecin pour votre traitement. Il est sage de se soumettre à des tests hospitaliers pour connaître votre condition physique. Beaucoup de gens sont diabétiques, beaucoup souffrent d'hypertension et beaucoup ont d'autres maladies qui, si elles sont connues tôt, peuvent être guéries. \"Frère, pouvez-vous passer un examen médical?\" \"Ah, ne vous embêtez pas\", avez-vous dit. C'est la peur et vous vous faites du mal. \"Je préfère ne pas savoir ce qui ne va pas chez moi.\" L'ignorance vous tuera, si vous préférez ne pas savoir ce qui ne va pas dans votre corps. \"Frère, frère, il y a des voleurs dans ta maison !\" « Pourquoi me donnez-vous cette information ? Voulez-vous me faire peur? Je n'aime pas ça, je veux aller chez moi\". C'est toi. Tu n'aimes pas connaître la vérité. Tu préfères te cacher dans l'obscurité ! Tu te caches sous un mensonge ! L'ignorance de la maladie et de la maladie qui détruit ton corps est destructeur.  **\n Esaïe 5 verset 13 ,14  **\n13 C'est pourquoi mon peuple est allé en captivité, parce qu'il n'a aucune connaissance, et ses hommes honorables sont affamés, et sa multitude est desséchée par la soif.\n14 C'est pourquoi l'enfer s'est élargi et a ouvert sa bouche sans mesure, et leur gloire, et leur multitude, et leur pompe, et celui qui se réjouit, y descendront.  **\n\nSi vous avez des problèmes de santé, pourquoi ne pas aller à l'hôpital ? Si vous tardez à avoir des enfants avec votre femme, pourquoi ne pas consulter l'hôpital ? Si vous voyez que vous ne dormez pas bien ou que vous dormez trop, pourquoi ne pas aller à l'hôpital pour un examen ? Vous avez prié sans résultat, pourquoi ne le ferez-vous pas ? C'est pour votre bien. Ne laissez pas le diable vous tuer par ignorance. Dieu ne vous a pas donné l'esprit de peur. Pourquoi as tu peur? La vérité est toujours la vérité. Le test à l'hôpital ne vous donnera pas quelque chose ou le résultat de ce qui n'est pas dans votre corps. Au fait, vous avez la chance de tester dans de nombreux endroits. Ne concluez pas rapidement que c'est Satan qui vous opprime ou qui opprime les sorcières et les sorciers. De nombreuses maladies sataniques sont guéries dans les hôpitaux.  **\n\nFaites-vous examiner afin que la maladie ne vous renverse pas ou ne vous fasse pas mourir subitement ! Des examens réguliers vous aideront à savoir quand la maladie survient. C'est la sagesse de Dieu par l'intermédiaire des médecins. Mais si vous refusez, Dieu peut se taire. Quelqu'un qui est mort par négligence peut ne pas arriver au paradis non plus. Il n'avait pas la foi. S'il avait foi en la sagesse de Dieu sur les médicaments et en faisait usage, il ne serait pas mort. Maintenant qu'il est mort de cette façon, où va-t-il ? Ne refusez pas les conseils divins.  **\n\nProverbes 29 verset 1  **\n\"Celui qui, étant souvent réprimandé, endurcit son cou, sera soudainement détruit, et cela sans remède.\"  **\n\nDe nombreuses églises rejettent l'utilisation de la médecine et des médecins à leur damnation éternelle. Que le Seigneur vous fasse utiliser cette connaissance pour vous garder en vie. Que le Seigneur vous accorde la grâce de travailler pour lui jusqu'au bout. Que le Seigneur sauve ta famille ? Que le Seigneur sauve vos voisins. Que le Seigneur sauve le monde. Que le Seigneur fasse de vous un instrument entre ses mains. Que le Seigneur vous garde en bonne santé physique et spirituelle.  ** **\n\n\n\n\nCHAPITRE QUATRE  **\nL'USAGE DE LA MEDECINE EST SCRIPTURAL  **\n\n4.1 Tout est à vous en Christ  **\n\nLes chrétiens sont les enfants de Dieu et il leur a donné toutes les choses dont ils peuvent profiter, y compris les médicaments. Les enfants de Dieu peuvent utiliser la foi pour leur guérison ou des médicaments pour leur guérison lorsqu'ils sont malades. Ils peuvent prendre des médicaments conventionnels ou à base de plantes. Les plantes médicinales à utiliser doivent être hygiéniques et exemptes de liens démoniaques.  **\n 1 Corinthiens 3 versets 21 à 23  **\n21 Que personne donc ne se glorifie dans les hommes. Car tout est à vous ;\n22 Soit Paul, soit Apollos, soit Céphas, soit le monde, soit la vie, soit la mort, soit les choses présentes, soit les choses à venir ; tout est à vous;\n23\tEt vous êtes à Christ; et Christ est à Dieu.  **\n1Timothée 6 17  **\n« Ordonne aux riches de ce monde de ne pas s'élever d'esprit ni de se fier à des richesses incertaines, mais au Dieu vivant, qui nous donne richement toutes choses pour en jouir » ;  **\n\n\"...toutes les choses à apprécier\". L'accent est mis sur \"toutes choses\". Toutes les choses qui vous sont bénéfiques dans la création de Dieu sont à vous. Dieu nous a richement donné toutes choses pour en profiter. Ce qui vous donnera la paix ; ce qui vous donnera de la joie; ce qui vous donnera du repos vous est donné par Dieu. Dieu vous a donné toutes choses pour que vous en jouissiez. L'accent est mis ici sur le sens moral de toutes choses, non pas dans le mal, mais sur ce qui vous sert. Bonne santé et vie saine comme promis dans les Ecritures du Seigneur.  **\n\nJacques 1 verset 17  **\n\"Tout don bon et tout don parfait vient d'en haut et descend du Père des lumières, chez qui il n'y a ni variation, ni ombre de changement.\"  **\n\nNous remarquons dans cette vie les choses que Dieu a librement données aux hommes pour les bénir sur la terre, telles que la connaissance du son, de la lumière, la connaissance du soleil, de la lune, des planètes et des étoiles, la connaissance de la médecine, la connaissance de l'invention, la connaissance des réparations, connaissance du traitement médical, connaissance du bâtiment et des constructions, connaissance de l'agriculture et de la production alimentaire, et bien d'autres si nombreuses à mentionner ici. Dieu donne gratuitement toutes choses à l'homme pour son plaisir et son bien-être. Ces dons de Dieu devraient être utilisés avec appréciation envers Dieu au lieu d'être rejetés.  **\n\n4.2 La connaissance de la médecine est bonne.  **\n\nAvant l'introduction de la médecine conventionnelle ou orthodoxe, la phytothérapie ou la médecine naturelle existait dans le monde. Les gens prenaient des médicaments et guérissaient au point que l'Écriture dit    **\n \nProverbes 17 verset 22  **\n« Un cœur joyeux fait du bien comme un médicament  \nCela nous dit que les médicaments font du bien. Les Écritures montrent que les médicaments font du bien à l'humanité.  ** \n\nEsaïe 5 verset 20  **\n« Malheur à ceux qui appellent le mal bien, et le bien mal ; qui a remplacé les ténèbres par la lumière et la lumière par les ténèbres ; qui mettent l'amer pour le doux et le doux pour l'amer !  **\n\nIl n'est pas déplacé dans l'Écriture de dire ; mon fils, prends des médicaments, car les médicaments sont bons, comme le dit aussi l'Ecriture   mon fils, mange du miel, car le miel est bon. Si la Bible appelle le miel une bonne chose et que quelqu'un vient et interdit de manger du miel; disant ne mangez pas de miel, la même Bible dit, malheur à cet homme. La personne qui dit, ne mangez pas de miel, c'est mal, dit que ce que Dieu dit est bon n'est pas vraiment bon, mais mauvais. C'est ce que Satan a dit à Eve et Adam dans le jardin pour les détruire. Une telle personne est satanique. Par conséquent, les églises qui prêchent contre l'utilisation de médicaments par les malades font un grand mal.  **\n\n1Tim 4 verset 1, 3 à 5  **\n1 Or l'Esprit dit expressément que, dans les derniers temps, certains s'éloigneront de la foi, prêtant attention aux esprits séducteurs et aux doctrines des démons ;\n3 Interdisant de se marier et ordonnant de s'abstenir des viandes que Dieu a créées pour être reçues avec actions de grâces de la part de ceux qui croient et connaissent la vérité.\n4 Car toute créature de Dieu est bonne, et il n'y a rien à refuser, si elle est reçue avec actions de grâces ;\n5 Car il est sanctifié par la parole de Dieu et la prière.  **\n\nLe diable s'immisce beaucoup parmi les hommes pour les détourner de ce qui est bon en le nommant mauvais, surtout dans l'église, au point qu'une création de Dieu, aussi belle soit-elle, donnée pour le bénéfice humain, Satan viendrait dire ils sont mauvais; ou il passe par des prédicateurs, des hommes religieux, pour jeter une mauvaise réputation sur une bonne chose. La médecine a subi de nombreuses attaques. Beaucoup de gens sont venus dire que c'est un péché de prendre des médicaments, ou en fait, que ceux qui prennent des médicaments iront en enfer parce que cela montre qu'ils n'ont pas foi en Jésus. C'est une doctrine du diable. L'Écriture dit que la médecine est bonne. La Bible dit que Dieu a créé toutes choses bonnes pour notre usage par la prière et l'action de grâces.  **\n\n\nPremier Timothée 4 verset 3 à 4  **\n3 Interdisant de se marier et ordonnant de s'abstenir des viandes que Dieu a créées pour être reçues avec actions de grâces de la part de ceux qui croient et connaissent la vérité.\n4 Car toute créature de Dieu est bonne, et il n'y a rien à refuser, si elle est reçue avec actions de grâces  **\n\nIl l'a créé pour être reçu par les croyants. Ceux qui croient et connaissent la vérité la reçoivent avec action de grâces. Votre prière sur elle la sanctifie et la purifie. En l'utilisant, bénissez Dieu et soyez heureux pour sa sagesse. Peut-être y a-t-il des gens qui jusqu'à présent n'utilisent pas de combiné, car lorsque le combiné (téléphone) est arrivé récemment, certaines personnes ont dit que c'était la marque de la bête   \"Comment allez-vous rester ici et appeler quelqu'un dans un endroit éloigné et lui parler sans lien ? Cela doit avoir quelque chose à voir avec Satan. Peut-être par ignorance, ils le disent et s'en retirent. Les gens interprètent toujours (à travers le diable) de manière erronée les bonnes œuvres de Dieu. La connaissance est bonne, c'est pourquoi la Bible dit   « Il n'est pas bon qu'un homme soit sans connaissance » . Et la Bible dit aussi que plus tard, la connaissance augmentera. La Bible dit que la connaissance est bonne. La connaissance des découvertes est une bonne chose. Sinon, il n'y aurait pas eu de progrès dans la société humaine. Allez toujours à l'Écriture, connaissez la langue de l'Écriture, l'esprit de l'Écriture et profitez de la plénitude de Dieu dans cette vie.  **\n\n4.3 Médecine et satanisme.  **\n\nLa médecine existe purement et complètement séparée du satanisme, bien que Satan en profite souvent pour introduire ses vices dans l'humanité et la conduire à l'esclavage. Qui a créé l'eau ? Dieu! Est-ce pour de bon ? Oui, c'est pour notre bien. Vous pouvez aller là où il y a de l'eau et l'utiliser comme vous le souhaitez. Vous pouvez aller à la rivière ou au ruisseau et utiliser l'eau comme les autres. Certains peuvent simplement s'asseoir au bord de la rivière et profiter de la nature. Satan a fait craindre à beaucoup de gens un plan d'eau à cause de l'eau de maman (esprits de l'eau). Ils avertissent les autres de ne pas s'asseoir près de la mer ou de la rivière à cause des esprits de l'eau. C'est le travail et la tromperie de Satan. Satan a revendiqué la masse d'eau en montrant aux êtres humains que son royaume est à l'intérieur de l'eau. Qui lui a donné ce pouvoir ? Dieu a créé l'eau pour l'homme, pas Satan. Avec cette connaissance, vous pouvez aller dans n'importe quel plan d'eau et faire ce qui est naturel, ce qui contribuera à votre bien et au bien de l'humanité. Vous ne péchez pas et vous ne serez pas blessé non plus. Alors de la même manière, certaines personnes pensent que toutes ces médecines, conventionnelles et à base de plantes viennent de Satan. Qu'est-ce qui les rend sataniques ? Satan les a-t-il créés ? NON! Ils sont l'ouvrage de Dieu et Dieu les a rendus bons. C'est Satan qui profite de l'ignorance humaine pour promouvoir son nom. Nous ne devons pas donner la gloire de Dieu à Satan ou condamner le bon travail de Dieu.  **\n\n4.4 La source de la connaissance de Médecine.  **\n\nDieu conduit l'homme instinctivement et par d'autres moyens à découvrir ce qui est bon pour sa vie. C'est-à-dire quelque chose que vous pouvez savoir. On vous a dit que la médecine existe depuis le commencement du monde. Dieu dirige l'homme sur la façon de découvrir les choses qu'il a mises dans son monde pour les utiliser pour le bien de l'homme et pour sa gloire. Dieu est celui qui donne la connaissance de la médecine et de la thérapie médicale.  **\nEsaïe 28 verset 26  **\n\"Car son Dieu l'instruit à la discrétion, et lui enseigne.\"  **\n\nVous vous demandez peut-être   comment l'homme a-t-il acquis la connaissance des avions dans les airs, des navires sur la mer et des véhicules sur les routes ? Comment l'homme en est-il venu à les inventer ? Trouvons la réponse dans l'Ecriture ci-dessus, \"Car son Dieu l'instruit à la discrétion, et lui enseigne\". Vous pourriez aussi vous demander   comment l'homme a-t-il découvert la médecine ? Comment la médecine traditionnelle a-t-elle évolué ? Comment savaient-ils que la combinaison de cette feuille avec cette feuille guérirait une maladie particulière ? Encore une fois, obtenez la réponse de l'Ecriture ci-dessus, \"Verset 26. Car son Dieu l'instruit à la discrétion et lui enseigne\". Vous pouvez également demander, comment les médecins en sont-ils arrivés à opérer un homme et à découvrir quelque chose et à lui donner un nom ? Comment en sont-ils venus à connaître les fonctions des différentes parties du corps humain ? Ils peuvent le dessiner et l'étiqueter. Comment ont-ils appris cela ? Revenons à la réponse   « Car son Dieu l'instruit à la discrétion et l'enseigne ». Comment se fait-il que dans un village, il y ait quelqu'un qui soit capable de savoir soigner ceci ou cela ? Comment est-ce arrivé? Revenons à la réponse   « Car son Dieu l'instruit à la discrétion et l'enseigne. Le Dieu qui a créé cette vie connaît les besoins de la vie, c'est pourquoi il révèle des solutions aux problèmes ou aux maux des gens, instruit les gens, leur dit et montre comment cela peut être géré . Cela peut arriver dans un rêve. Dans un rêve, ils peuvent voir quelqu'un faire cela. Parfois, il peut s'agir d'une voix qui peut leur parler. Parfois, ce n'est que de l'instinct. L'esprit peut être capable d'imaginer certaines choses et de simplement voir les réalités de ces choses. Comme ils disent \"Je vais m'en occuper et voir.\" A leur grande surprise, ça marche ! Pourquoi pensons-nous que Dieu a créé ce monde et que c'est Satan qui le gère pour Dieu et que tout ce qui se passe est Satan ?  **\nPsaumes 24 verset 1  **\n« La terre est à l'Éternel, et tout ce qu'elle contient ; le monde et ceux qui y habitent.  **\nEcclésiaste 11 verset 5  **\n\"De même que tu ne sais pas quelle est la voie de l'esprit, ni comment les os grandissent dans le sein de celle qui est enceinte, de même tu ne connais pas les oeuvres de Dieu qui fait tout.\"  **\n\nVous dites toujours aux personnes sous phytothérapie   « fais attention, Satan ! Satan!!\" Pourquoi penses tu comme ça? Permettez-moi de vous demander, les animaux   moutons, chèvres, vaches, chiens, poulets et autres, et ceux de la brousse aussi, tombent-ils malades ? Qui les guérit ? Comment sont-ils guéris ? Ils vont chercher des feuilles de cure. Même les animaux savent soigner leurs maladies. Revenons à la même Ecriture. Au lieu de dire, son Dieu, dites maintenant son Dieu. \"Car son Dieu l'instruit à la discrétion, et l'enseigne\". Pouvez-vous voir Dieu ? Maintenant, voyez-vous Dieu en tout maintenant ? Voyez-vous Dieu dans la connaissance de la vie, dans la connaissance bénéfique de la vie ?\n\nSavez-vous que Satan hait tout ce qui est bon ? Il n'est jamais au profit de l'humanité. Il ne fait rien de bon, sauf qu'il l'utilisera comme appât. Il utilisera une bonne chose qui vient de Dieu et y mettra son mal. Mais pour le bien, le bien ne vient pas de Satan. Par conséquent, n'attribuez pas toujours toutes les bonnes choses qui se passent dans cette vie à Satan. Même parmi les incroyants, le Dieu qui les a créés veut qu'ils soient en bonne santé. S'ils mouraient, comment entendraient-ils l'évangile ? Comment entendraient-ils le message ? La Bible ne dit-elle pas que ce n'est pas la volonté de Dieu qu'aucun homme périsse mais que tous arrivent à la connaissance de Dieu et à la repentance ? Dieu ne ferait-il donc pas tout ce qui est nécessaire pour les maintenir en vie jusqu'à ce qu'ils aient l'occasion de se repentir ? Alors pourquoi pensez-vous que les personnes parmi eux qui les soignent dans leurs maladies et maladies sont toutes démoniaques ? Le démonisme et la médecine curative sont deux choses différentes. N'écoutez pas les hommes ignorants et les chefs d'église.  **\n\nMatthieu 12 verset 22 à 28  **\n22 Alors on lui amena un démoniaque, aveugle et muet, et il le guérit, de sorte que l'aveugle et le muet parlaient et voyaient. 23 Et tout le peuple fut dans l'étonnement, et dit   N'est-ce pas le Fils de David ? 24 Mais quand les pharisiens l'entendirent, ils dirent   Cet homme ne chasse pas les démons, mais par Belzébuth, le prince des démons.\n25 Et Jésus connut leurs pensées, et leur dit   Tout royaume divisé contre lui-même est dévasté ; et toute ville ou maison divisée contre elle-même ne subsistera pas;\n26 Et si Satan chasse Satan, il est divisé contre lui-même ; comment son royaume se tiendra-t-il alors?\n27 Et si je chasse les démons par Belzébuth, par qui vos enfants les chassent-ils ? c'est pourquoi ils seront vos juges.\n28 Mais si je chasse les démons par l'Esprit de Dieu, alors le royaume de Dieu est venu à vous.  **\n\n4.5 Démonisme et médecine.  **\n\n Un homme est d'abord démoniaque, puis il reçoit de bons médicaments. Il peut ou non appliquer son démonisme sur son traitement. Un bon médicament est une formule naturelle. Il ne peut y apporter son démonisme que pour souiller l'humanité. S'il dit   « d'accord, avant que je fasse ça pour toi, tu vas sacrifier ça ; vous devez faire ceci ou cela; lorsque vous faites cuire ce médicament, saupoudrez du sang d'animaux sur cette pierre. Ne transportez pas de bois de chauffage d'un côté à l'autre ». C'est du démonisme. Toutes ces choses ne font pas partie de ce qui apportera la guérison. Il utilise la connaissance de la guérison médicale pour asservir l'homme – à Satan. Le démonisme et la médecine sont deux choses distinctes ; que ce soit la phytothérapie ou la médecine conventionnelle. Qu'il s'agisse de compléments alimentaires ou de médicaments chimiques, séparez-les du démonisme. Ne suivez pas ceux qui les appellent des produits de Satan. Certains vous diront même que le Saint-Esprit l'a révélé. Rejetez-le parce qu'il n'est pas conforme aux Écritures. Si la médecine ne produit pas de résultats; conventionnelle ou à base de plantes, ce n'est pas une chose étrange. Dans la vie, certaines choses et certaines personnes ne produisent pas les résultats escomptés. La médecine est bonne comme la nourriture est bonne. La médecine donne la santé et la force, la nourriture donne la santé et la force. Ainsi, le démonisme est différent de la médecine. Ce que vous devez donc éviter et fuir, c'est le démonisme. Ce qui souille un chrétien, c'est le démonisme et non la médecine ; qu'ils soient à base de plantes (traditionnels) ou conventionnels. C'est cet aspect du traitement qui est dans les ténèbres, qui n'a pas la lumière de l'Écriture, que Satan prend en charge parce qu'il est le prince des ténèbres. Les gens qui font pour nous les inventions de diverses choses de la vie ne sont pas tous croyants. Pourquoi ne dit-on pas que l'avion est démoniaque ? Pourquoi ne dit-on pas que les véhicules à moteur sont aussi démoniaques ? Pourquoi ne disons-nous pas que les vêtements fabriqués pour nous sont démoniaques ? Les gens qui les ont fabriqués sont pour la plupart des incroyants. Doit-on alors dire que les incroyants qui font des traitements sont démoniaques ou que leurs traitements sont démoniaques parce qu'ils sont incroyants ? Regardez bien et comprenez avec votre cœur.  **\n\nDeuxième Timothée 2 verset 7  **\n« Considérez ce que je dis ; et que le Seigneur te donne l'intelligence en toutes choses.  **\n\n4.6 Souffrance des Justes.  **\n\nIci, nous considérons les cas de maladies et d'affections des justes parce qu'il y a des gens qui pensent que les justes ne peuvent pas être malades. Non pas que les justes doivent être malades. Non! Bien sûr, l'habitant ne dira pas, je suis malade. Cependant, considérons les circonstances suivantes afin de mieux comprendre la sagesse de Dieu    **\n\nje. La provision suffisante de Dieu  **\nDieu peut manifester sa puissance dans un sens particulier lorsqu'il a conduit les enfants d'Israël d'Égypte vers la terre promise. La Bible dit qu'il n'y avait pas d'homme faible parmi eux.\nMême les vêtements qu'ils mettaient sur leur corps ne s'usaient pas. C'est une manifestation spéciale de la puissance de Dieu. Dieu peut décider de faire en sorte que les choses se passent ainsi. Mais est-ce que les vêtements des croyants ne s'usent pas ? Non! Ils s'usent. Les vêtements que vous avez utilisés se sont usés plusieurs fois. En fait, les vêtements que vous avez utilisés il y a quatre ans, vous ne les porterez peut-être plus. Pourquoi? Ils se sont usés suivant la loi de la nature. Parfois, Dieu permettra à la loi de la nature de prendre effet. Pourquoi? Il a pris des dispositions suffisantes pour le contrer. Ainsi, les croyants peuvent être malades. Savez-vous que le ruisseau d'eau vers lequel Elie a été envoyé par Dieu a suivi la loi de la nature et qu'il s'est finalement asséché au point qu'il a dû chercher un autre endroit, parce que c'était la loi de la nature ? Dieu permet à la nature d'avoir son propre cours. Il ne peut pas choisir de le modifier. Il peut le modifier par miracle mais Il ne le fait pas toujours.  **\n\nii. Besoin d'un garde du corps.  **\n\nEsdras a dit  \"J'ai pensé aller voir le roi pour lui dire de nous escorter pendant que nous nous dirigeons vers Jérusalem à cause des voleurs, des méchants et des assaillants sur le chemin.\" S'il l'avait demandé, cela n'aurait pas été un péché. Non! Cela n'aurait pas été un péché. Les gens qui ne comprennent pas les Écritures raisonnent les choses différemment. Certaines de ces personnes peuvent se demander   « Pourquoi voyez-vous des hommes de Dieu transporter des agents de sécurité ? Pourquoi demandes-tu cela? Est-ce mal? La plupart des gens qui voient Jésus dans des visions disent qu'ils le voient avec deux anges ou avec un ange, non pas que quelqu'un puisse le blesser, mais les escortes sont essentielles pour lui rendre service. Qu'un prédicateur accompagne certaines personnes comme escortes n'est pas une chose à condamner. Esdras dit alors   \"Parce que j'ai parlé au roi de la grandeur de Dieu, dans ce court laps de temps, si je reviens encore, mon message sera mélangé.\" Ezra a prié   « Dieu, nous aurions demandé la sécurité dans notre voyage, mais je veux que tu considères que ton nom et ton pouvoir ont été exaltés auparavant. Nous avons dit au roi que vous pouvez faire tout ce qui est en votre pouvoir. Oh Seigneur, donne-nous ta sécurité ! Le Seigneur l'a entendu parce qu'il y avait une demande spéciale pour cela. Sinon, la loi normale de la vie, dans un tel voyage, est d'aller avec le personnel de sécurité. Car vous ne tenterez pas le Seigneur votre Dieu. Quand Jésus a remarqué qu'ils voulaient le tuer dans la communauté juive à ce moment-là, il n'a jamais marché dans la communauté juive. Alors comprenons bien.  **\n\niii. Maladie des Justes.  **\n\nLe juste peut-il être malade ? Oui! L'homme juste peut être malade et peut être opprimé par le diable. Il est dans ce monde. Satan est dans ce monde.  **\n\nPsaumes 41 verset 1 à 3  **\n1 Heureux celui qui considère le pauvre, l'Éternel le délivrera au temps de la détresse.\n2 L'Éternel le gardera et le fera vivre; et il sera béni sur la terre et tu ne le livreras pas à la volonté de ses ennemis. 3 L'Éternel le fortifiera sur le lit de languissement, tu feras tout son lit dans sa maladie.  **\n\nQui est cet homme dont parle le Seigneur ? Bien sûr, l'homme juste. Peut-il être malade ? Oui! L'homme juste peut être malade. Par conséquent, connaissez cette Écriture afin que l'humilité soit toujours avec vous. Connaissez cette Écriture afin de ne pas tomber dans l'hypocrisie et de donner un faux témoignage pour montrer à quel point vous êtes juste, en l'attachant à votre justice. « Non, je n'ai pas été malade pendant tout ce temps. En fait, depuis que j'ai donné ma vie à Jésus. Oui, Dieu a fait cela pour vous, mais n'interrogez pas votre frère en Christ qui est malade. Au contraire, priez et délivrez-le. C'est la grâce de Dieu dont vous avez joui. Même parmi les pécheurs, il y en a qui n'ont jamais été malades. Mais en réalité, les justes et les pécheurs peuvent être malades, mais la foi et la prière guériraient les justes. Dieu fera tout son lit dans sa maladie.  **\nJob 2 verset 7 à 8  **\n7 Ainsi Satan sortit de la présence de l'ORD, et frappa Job d'un furoncle douloureux depuis la plante de son pied jusqu'à son sommet.\n8 Et il lui prit un tesson pour se gratter avec ; et il s'assit parmi les cendres.  **\nSatan est sorti de la présence de Dieu ! Le Seigneur savait que Job serait malade. Le Seigneur savait aujourd'hui que le soir, Job serait attaqué de maladie. Qu'est-ce que Dieu a fait à ce sujet? Il était silencieux. Je veux que vous le sachiez afin que vous soyez un enfant de Dieu humble et doux. Quand Isaac a été lié, il n'a pas résisté. Il a donné à Abraham toute la coopération pour le lier. Il n'a pas lutté contre lui. Certaines misères peuvent entrer dans votre vie, ne traitez pas grossièrement avec Dieu. Certaines maladies peuvent vous tomber dessus, ne posez pas de questions grossières. Dieu ne le savais-tu pas ? Ne saviez-vous pas que cela venait à moi ? \n\nNe savait-il pas ? Il savait. N'était-il pas au courant ? Il était conscient que ça arriverait comme ça s'est passé, que le nom de la maladie s'appellerait ainsi ! Il était conscient mais s'est tu parce que vous ne connaissez pas la dispute entre Lui et Satan. Vous ne savez pas ce qu'Il envisage de faire concernant la situation. N'as-tu pas été créé pour sa gloire ? Et s'il décide que tu meurs ? Job a dit   « même s'il me tue, je lui ferai toujours confiance ». Alors soyez calme. Ne blâmez pas Dieu, même sur la durée de la maladie. Job a-t-il prié le premier jour où il a vu le signe ? A-t-il prié pendant toute la période de la maladie pour que Dieu le guérisse ? Oui. Dieu répondait-il à ses prières ? Non. C'est pourquoi Job a dit   « Si je pouvais voir Dieu de mes yeux, je lui demanderais quelle était ta raison ? Quelqu'un peut-il traîner Dieu en justice ? Non. Job a raisonné, oh cet homme peut traîner Dieu en justice. Mais qui peut être l'avocat? Alors vous avez prié, attendez-Le. Il vous a dit qu'Il est conscient. Vous priez, mais attendez-le. Il réalise quelque chose dans un temps imparti. Attend le. La vision est encore pour un temps fixé. Même si cela tarde, que devez-vous faire ? Attendez-le. A la fin, le Seigneur apparaîtra pour vous. Qui a fait ça à Job ? Satan l'a fait et non Dieu.  **\n\nTravail 2 verset 7  **\n\"Alors Satan sortit de la présence de l'Éternel, et frappa Job d'un furoncle douloureux depuis la plante de son pied jusqu'à son sommet.\"  **\n\niv. Oppression satanique des Justes  **\n\nSatan peut-il opprimer un enfant de Dieu ? Oui. Alors pourquoi diriez-vous à l'enfant de Dieu opprimé dans son rêve qu'il appartient à une société secrète et que c'est l'initiation. Pourquoi ne le dites? Voulez-vous dire qu'aucun enfant de Dieu ne doit rêver comme ça ? Être averti! Vous détruisez la foi. Vous confondez un croyant. Qui t'a dit qu'aucun enfant de Dieu ne peut rêver comme ça ? N'est-ce pas une oppression satanique ? Dites-leur plutôt de prier. Satan est venu sur leur chemin. Laissez-les vérifier. Quels sont les signes qu'une personne est un enfant de Dieu ? Est-ce qu'il ne fera pas de mauvais rêves ? Cela fait-il partie des signes ? Non! Car quiconque est né de Dieu ne commet pas de péché. Était-il impliqué dans le rêve ? A-t-il invité l'esprit du rêve ? Était-il conscient du rêve ? Sa volonté était-elle impliquée dans le rêve ? Non. Alors pourquoi diriez-vous qu'il a commis un péché ? Il a rêvé qu'il nageait dans l'eau et vous avez dit qu'il avait un esprit de maman et qu'il devait aller chercher la délivrance. Il a rêvé qu'il faisait l'amour avec une femme dans le rêve et vous avez dit   « oh ! Vous avez été initié ». D'où vient cet évangile ? Pouvez-vous citer les écritures ? Au sens propre, cet homme est un homme juste. Cet homme est saint. C'est juste qu'il traverse l'oppression satanique. Les deux sont différents. C'est donc ce que nous devons savoir et comprendre afin que nous puissions avoir un christianisme équilibré et ne pas apporter de soucis et d'angoisses aux enfants de Dieu. Qu'ils continuent plutôt à prier jusqu'à ce que l'affaire soit réglée. Qu'ils demandent conseil. Qu'ils continuent à chercher des prières jusqu'à ce que l'affaire soit réglée.  **\nPremier Pierre 5 verset 7 à 11  **\n7 Déchargez-vous sur lui de tous vos soucis ; car il prend soin de vous.\n8 Sois sobre, sois vigilant ; parce que votre adversaire, le diable, rôde comme un lion rugissant, cherchant qui il dévorera ;\n9 Qui résistez avec fermeté dans la foi, sachant que les mêmes afflictions s'accomplissent chez vos frères qui sont dans le monde.\n10 Mais le Dieu de toute grâce, qui nous a appelés à sa gloire éternelle par le Christ Jésus, après que vous aurez souffert un moment, vous rendra parfait, vous affermira, vous fortifiera, vous affermira.\n11 A lui la gloire et la domination pour les siècles des siècles. Amen.  **\n\nv. La maladie peut être une attaque.  **\n\nMaintenant, nous savons que Job était malade. Nous savons qu'il y a beaucoup de prédicateurs qui prêchent des choses contraires. Job était juste et pourtant était affligé par la maladie. Pas pour ses péchés, mais pour un cours qui était entre les mains de Dieu. La Bible nous dit dans Jacques chapitre cinq que la prière de la foi sauvera le malade et s'il a commis un péché, il lui sera pardonné . Mais souvenez-vous du mot \"si\". Ce n'est pas que la maladie soit venue à cause du péché. Non! « Si », car il peut aussi être malade sans être pécheur ou sans avoir rétrogradé. Ce n'est pas nécessairement un jugement divin. C'est l'attaque du diable ou la loi de la nature.  **\n\nIl pourrait y avoir une maladie particulière courante dans la lignée de votre père. Certains de vos frères et sœurs l'ont contracté. Cela peut vous passer. Vous pouvez dire   Mon sang est le sang de Jésus-Christ, aucune maladie ne peut m'atteindre ». Priez et utilisez la foi pour y résister. Sinon, c'est un flux naturel. C'est une loi. C'est seulement que vous avez l'espoir que si cela vient, vous avez un Guérisseur. La différence entre vous et le reste des membres de la famille est que vous savez où vous pouvez être guéri. En tant que croyant, vous pouvez être guéri ou par la foi résister pour ne pas venir à vous par la foi en Christ. Ceux parmi vos frères et sœurs qui ne sont pas en Christ ou qui ne peuvent pas prier souffriront de la maladie parce qu'elle est génétique. Puisque vous avez déjà connu la chose, priez et Dieu vous entendra. Continuez à prier jusqu'à ce qu'il disparaisse.  **\nvi. Maladie d'Elisée.  **\n\nEh bien, Elisée était malade.\n\nPremiers Rois 13 verset 14  **\n« Or Elisée était tombé malade de sa maladie dont il est mort… »  **\n\nVous connaissez Elisée ? Qui était-il? Aman d'onction en double portion. Oui, la présence de Dieu était en lui. Les morts sont ressuscités et le Jourdain s'est divisé. Élisée ! L'enfant de la Sunamite revint à la vie. Elisée est tombé malade ! Était-il rétrograde à ce moment-là ? Non. Laissez-moi vous montrer le signe qu'il n'était pas rétrograde.  **\n\nSecond rois 13 verset 14 à 17  **\n14 Or Élisée était tombé malade de sa maladie dont il mourut. Et Joas, roi d'Israël, descendit vers lui, et pleura sur son visage, et dit   Mon père, mon père, le char d'Israël et ses cavaliers.\n15 Et Élisée lui dit   Prends un arc et des flèches. Et il prit un arc et des flèches.\n16 Et il dit au roi d'Israël   Mets ta main sur l'arc. Et il posa sa main dessus et Élisée posa ses mains sur les mains du roi.\n17 Et il dit   Ouvre la fenêtre à l'orient. Et il l'ouvrit. Alors Elisée dit   Tirez. Et il a tiré. Et il dit  La flèche de délivrance de l'Éternel , et la flèche de délivrance de la Syrie; car tu frapperas les Syriens à Aphek, jusqu'à ce que tu les aies consumés.  **\n\nLa prophétie a continué et pourtant il était toujours malade. Je dis cela parce que l'orgueil empêche certains hommes de Dieu d'admettre qu'ils sont malades. Satan peut leur dire, si vous permettez à vos membres de savoir que vous êtes malades, votre ministère est terminé. Qui te l'a dit? Un enfant de Dieu peut être malade. Dieu peut garder un croyant sain et en bonne santé selon sa grâce, mais sachez tous que ses enfants peuvent aussi être malades.  **\n\n4.7 Raisons de maladie.  **\nDieu a des raisons pour lesquelles il permet des maladies sur ses enfants. Certaines des raisons incluent ce qui suit     **\n\ni.\tEnseigner la connaissance et la compréhension.  ** \nIl veut enseigner la connaissance et la compréhension à Son peuple. Jacob a fini de bénir ses enfants et a ramené ses jambes sur le lit et a dormi ou est mort paisiblement. Certains hommes de foi diraient   « Je n'ai pas besoin d'être malade. Dans mon temps de mort, je ne serai pas malade. Je vais simplement m'asseoir ou m'allonger et le Seigneur me prendra. Mais il y a des prédicateurs que vous n'avez pas entendus parce qu'ils étaient malades. Ils se sont juste assis comme ça et sont morts. Mais leurs âmes ne sont pas allées au ciel. Ce n'était pas qu'ils étaient justes et que Dieu les a pris. Ce qui est arrivé à ces personnes vient de Satan, pas de Dieu. Alors pourquoi vous en vantez-vous ? Pourquoi enseignez-vous cela comme doctrine? Que quelqu'un soit tombé malade, ne dites pas   « Non ! Non! Un croyant ne peut pas être malade et mourir de maladie. Que veux-tu dire? Au lieu de cela, lorsque vous encouragez une personne très malade, ayez deux esprits qui   -  **\n(je). Il peut récupérer. (ii). Il devrait se préparer ou être préparé pour le ciel au cas où il ne se rétablirait pas. Les enfants hébreux que Nebucadnetsar menaça de jeter au feu dirent   « Notre Dieu peut nous délivrer. S'il ne le fait pas, nous sommes toujours prêts à mourir pour lui et nous ne nous prosternerons jamais pour votre dieu ». Parce que Dieu peut choisir de ne pas délivrer, soyez toujours conscient de l'éternité. Élisée est mort de maladie. Ne laissez pas Satan instiller de l'orgueil en vous dans votre maladie mourante afin qu'au lieu d'examiner votre vie et de vous humilier devant Dieu et les hommes, vous puissiez être fier et parler fièrement comme si vous n'étiez pas soumis à la loi de la vérité. Votre vantardise peut être charnelle et peut aboutir à votre mort sans humble préparation pour l'éternité.\n\nN'abusons pas de la doctrine de la foi en Dieu dans nos difficultés, nos attaques et nos maladies et ne périssons pas à cause de l'orgueil. Soyez toujours humble. Si vous visitez les malades, vous ne devez pas leur présenter de fierté au nom de la foi. Citez plutôt les promesses de Dieu pour fortifier leur foi. Mais étudiez les circonstances ; rappelez-vous aussi que Dieu qui a fait la main droite a aussi fait la gauche. La jambe droite, la jambe gauche. L'œil droit, l'œil gauche. Il y a donc ces deux chances dans la maladie. Vivre ou mourir. Rappelez-vous en toutes circonstances de préparer la personne pour l'éternité.   **\n\nii.\tPour montrer la miséricorde de Dieu (la guérison est par la miséricorde)   **\nNous savons maintenant que les justes peuvent être malades.\nEpaphras était malade.  **\n\nPhilippiens 2 verset 25 à 28  **\n25 Pourtant j'ai pensé qu'il était nécessaire de t'envoyer Epaphrodite, mon frère, et mon compagnon de travail, et mon compagnon d'armes, mais ton messager, et celui qui pourvoyait à mes besoins.\n26 Car il désirait après vous tous, et était accablé, parce que vous aviez appris qu'il était malade.\n27 En effet, il était malade jusqu'à la mort, mais Dieu a eu pitié de lui ; et non seulement sur lui, mais sur moi aussi, de peur que je n'aie tristesse sur tristesse.\n28 Je l'ai donc envoyé avec plus de soin, afin que, lorsque vous le reverrez, vous vous réjouissiez, et que je sois moins attristé.  **\n\nApprenez quelque chose ici. Sous le ministère de l'apôtre Paul, Epaphras était malade. La maladie a duré longtemps au point qu'ils craignaient qu'il ne meure. Paul, que diriez-vous de donner un mouchoir à Epaphras ? Paul, tu n'avais plus de tablier ? Qu'en est-il de la pose d'un tablier sur Epaphras ? « Ceux qui se sont manifestés en un bref instant dans mon ministère. Ce n'étaient pas des choses qui ont continué avec moi.'' Alors, Paul, n'êtes-vous pas celui que le Seigneur a utilisé pour des miracles tout autour ? Celui-ci est maintenant avec vous. Que s'est-il passé pour qu'il ne soit pas encore guéri depuis longtemps? Paul, est-ce que Dieu n'entend plus vos prières ? Il m'entend, mais ce dont vous parlez n'est pas une question de vantardise. Cela arrive par la miséricorde de Dieu. Ce n'est pas une chose dont je peux me vanter. \n\nJ'irai le libérer. « C'est Dieu qui a eu pitié de lui et de moi. Il m'a fallu de longues prières, pas seulement moi; d'autres aussi. Nous avons continué à prier. Dieu nous a fait miséricorde. Ne pensez donc pas que la guérison toute-puissante est entre mes mains. Ne pensez pas qu'un prédicateur oint peut traiter toutes les maladies. Pas même en Jésus. Lorsqu'il est allé chez lui, il n'a imposé les mains qu'à quelques personnes. Pourquoi? L'incrédulité était en eux. Le cas d'Epaphras pourrait ne pas être le cas de l'incrédulité. Il se peut que le Seigneur enseigne une leçon. « Paul, toi et ceux qui travaillent avec toi, apprends à te reposer. Ne savez-vous pas qu'à un moment, J'ai retiré Mes disciples pour un repos ? Voyez l'effet sur Epaphraditus maintenant. Et donc l'homme était malade. Toutes les prières de la foi n'ont pas fonctionné, mais la prière pour la miséricorde de Dieu. Dieu a eu pitié de lui. Nous savons qu'Ézéchias a présenté sa justice et que Dieu l'a entendu. Mais ce n'est pas tout le temps qu'il vous guérira à cause de votre justice. C'est pour sa miséricorde. Dieu lui a fait miséricorde, ainsi qu'à Paul, et l'a guéri. C'est ce que la parole de Dieu nous enseigne. Avec cette compréhension, prions pour les malades et les opprimés avec toutes les prières mais laissons le résultat à Dieu, qui sait et fait toutes choses selon sa vérité et sa miséricorde.  **\n\n4.8 Les promesses de Dieu sur la protection, la guérison et la délivrance  **\nExode 15 verset 26  **\n« Et dit   Si tu écoutes attentivement la voix de l'Éternel, ton Dieu, et que tu fasses ce qui est droit à ses yeux, et que tu prêtes l'oreille à ses commandements, et que tu observes toutes ses lois, je ne mettrai aucune de ces maladies. sur toi, que j'ai fait venir sur les Égyptiens, car je suis l'Éternel qui te guérit.  **\n\nDieu afflige les pécheurs de maladies mais pas ses enfants fidèles. Il afflige les pécheurs parce qu'Il dit   « Je les mettrai sur vos ennemis » dans le cadre de Son jugement, parce qu'Il est un Dieu de Jugement. Pour les enfants de Dieu, Dieu est leur guérisseur. Quand la maladie tombe sur eux, Dieu va les guérir. Il est leur Guérisseur. Vous n'avez pas besoin de l'attention d'un médecin lorsqu'il n'y a pas de maladie à traiter.  **\nDeutéronome 7 verset 14 à 15  **\n« Tu seras béni plus que tout le monde, il n'y aura pas de mâle ou de femelle stérile parmi toi, ni parmi ton bétail. 15 Et l'Éternel éloignera de toi toute maladie, et ne mettra sur toi aucune des mauvaises maladies d'Égypte que tu connais; mais je les imposerai à tous ceux qui te haïssent.  **\n\n\"Il n'y aura personne de stérile parmi toi.\" Comprenez-le scripturairement. Zacharie et Elizabeth sa femme ont vécu longtemps sans enfants. Pourquoi? Elle était stérile. Mais combien de temps ? Dieu regardait cela. Est-ce que ça s'est terminé ? Oui, c'est arrivé à sa fin. Ainsi, l'Écriture ne parle peut-être pas d'une situation momentanée. Mais il est possible qu'un couple chrétien reste stérile jusqu'à sa mort. Cherchez dans les Écritures pour comprendre pourquoi Dieu le permet. La compréhension vous gardera. La discrétion vous préservera.\n\nPaul ne s'est pas marié. Qui l'a fait ne pas se marier ? Dieu certainement. Dieu qui donne des femmes aux hommes n'en a pas donné à Paul parce que cela affecterait le travail qu'il était appelé à faire. De même, quelqu'un d'autre qui est un enfant de Dieu et un ministre de l'évangile peut se marier et le Seigneur ne peut pas lui donner d'enfants. Pourquoi? Cela peut affecter le travail qu'ils sont appelés à faire. Il y en a de véritables parmi ces gens qui ne peuvent pas se marier, pour l'amour de l'évangile, non pas comme le font les catholiques, mais par la volonté du Seigneur. Dieu accorde une grâce suffisante à ceux qu'il appelle selon sa volonté.  **\n\n4.9 Dieu souhaite que vous soyez en bonne santé.  **\nTroisième Jean 2  **\n« Bien-aimé, je souhaite par-dessus tout que tu prospères et sois en bonne santé, comme ton âme prospère. \"  **\nC'est le désir de Dieu. Votre prospérité et votre santé sont le désir de Dieu pour vous. Suivez les conditions requises et vous les trouverez selon la volonté de Dieu. \"Je souhaite par-dessus tout.\" C'est le désir de Dieu pour vous. Croyez-le dans votre cœur, poursuivez-le et obtenez-le.  **\n\nMatthieu 15 verset 22 à 28  **\n22 Et voici, une femme de Canaan sortit des mêmes côtes, et lui cria, disant   Aie pitié de moi, ô Seigneur, fils de David ; ma fille est affreusement vexée d'un diable.\n23 Mais il ne lui répondit pas un mot. Et ses disciples s'approchèrent et le prièrent, disant  Renvoie-la; car elle crie après nous.\n24 Mais il répondit et dit   Je ne suis envoyé qu'aux brebis perdues de la maison d'Israël.\n25 Alors elle vint et l'adora, disant   Seigneur, aide-moi.\n26 Mais il répondit et dit   Il ne convient pas de prendre le pain des enfants et de le jeter aux chiens.\n27 Et elle dit   Vérité, Seigneur ; pourtant les chiens mangent les miettes qui tombent de la table de leurs maîtres.\n28 Alors Jésus répondit et lui dit   Ô femme, ta foi est grande, qu'il te soit fait comme tu veux. Et sa fille fut guérie à partir de cette heure même.  **\n\n Le verset 26 dit \"Mais il répondit et dit  Il n'est pas convenable de prendre le pain des enfants et de le jeter aux chiens \". Quelle chose est maintenant le pain des enfants? « Guérison et délivrance. Cela signifie que les enfants de Dieu peuvent tomber malades. Ses enfants peuvent être opprimés. Par conséquent, chaque fois qu'ils sont malades, comme n'importe qui peut avoir faim et avoir besoin de nourriture ; Il donne aussi la guérison aux malades et la délivrance aux opprimés. Ce sont ses enfants. Ses enfants peuvent être malades et opprimés par le diable. Comment savez-vous qu'ils sont Ses enfants ? Ils ne commettent pas de péché. Mais la personne qui est « possédée » par le diable commet un péché parce que Satan a pris le dessus sur la volonté de la personne. Il fait des choses qui sont mauvaises. Nous disons donc ne dites pas qu'un enfant de Dieu a été possédé par Satan. Ceux qui sont possédés par le diable n'ont pas le pouvoir de faire la justice. Mais un vrai enfant de Dieu peut être malade; Satan peut déranger d'une manière ou d'une autre. Satan peut tuer son enfant ou sa femme comme le cas de Job. Mais rappelez-vous que Dieu était au courant et veillait sur l'affaire.\n\nDans certains cas, le croyant affecté ne s'est pas levé pour combattre au moment opportun. Mais pour certains, Dieu le permet parce qu'il y a une leçon de vie qui se cache derrière le rideau connu de Dieu seul. Parfois, Satan sait aussi comme dans le cas de Job. Donc, maintenant, nous comprenons que les justes peuvent être malades, opprimés, stériles ou pauvres. Mais Dieu est notre Sauveur, Fournisseur, Guérisseur et Libérateur.  **\n\n4.10 Comment le Seigneur guérit et délivre.  **\n\nje. En activant la parole de Sa promesse.  **\n \nDieu peut vous soutenir par la parole de Sa promesse que la maladie ne viendra pas sur vous. Bien-aimé, je souhaite par-dessus tout que tu puisses prospérer et être en bonne santé comme ton âme prospère. Dieu peut vous garder en bonne santé et vous ne connaîtrez pas la maladie. Les habitants ne diront pas que je suis malade. C'est la guérison préventive. La maladie ne vient pas, ce que beaucoup d'entre nous apprécient. Nous devons toujours faire confiance à Dieu pour nous protéger de la maladie et prier toujours pour notre protection et notre préservation. \"Il arrivera qu'avant qu'ils appellent, j'entendrai\".\nLa réponse vient avant que l'affaire ne commence. Ils ont empoisonné de la nourriture et vous n'êtes même pas au courant. Mais Dieu a pris soin. Si beau. En ce sens, Dieu fait beaucoup de choses à notre insu dont nous devons le remercier.  **\n\nii. Par la foi personnelle et la prière sur ses paroles et ses promesses.  **\n\nPsaume 107 verset 17 à 19  **\n17 Les insensés à cause de leur transgression et à cause de leurs iniquités sont affligés.\n18 Leur âme a horreur de toute sorte de viande; et ils s'approchent des portes de la mort.\n19 Alors ils crient au Seigneur dans leur détresse, et il les sauve de leurs détresses.\n20 Il envoya sa parole et les guérit, et les délivra de leurs destructions.\n\nDieu guérit et délivre ses enfants par la prière et la foi aux promesses de Dieu. Le problème est venu parce que, peut-être, vous avez commis un péché, ou quelle que soit la manière dont la maladie est venue. Allez à Dieu dans la prière. Pleure pour lui. Faites appel à lui. Combattez en son nom, combattez selon sa parole. Vous serez guéri. C'est une façon pour Dieu de le faire.  **\n\niii.\tPar la prière et l'intercession des autres pour les malades.  **\nJacques 5 verset 14 à 16  **\n14 Y a-t-il parmi vous des malades ? qu'il appelle les anciens de l'église ; et qu'ils prient sur lui, en l'oignant d'huile au nom du Seigneur;\n15 Et la prière de la foi sauvera le malade, et le Seigneur le relèvera ; et s'il a commis des péchés. Ils lui seront pardonnés.\n16 Confessez votre faute les uns aux autres et priez les uns pour les autres, afin que vous soyez guéris. La prière efficace et fervente d'un homme juste est très utile.  **\n\nPouvez-vous voir le lieu d'intercession? En tant que croyant que Dieu utilise pour que les gens soient guéris, ne soyez pas fier de dire ; « Je ne ferai savoir à personne que je suis malade. Si je leur dis que je souffre de telle ou telle maladie dans mon corps, ou que je traverse des attaques sataniques, les gens ne croiront plus en moi. Ils cesseront de venir me voir pour prier pour eux. À cause de cette mauvaise pensée dans votre cœur, nous voulons vous donner la connaissance complète des Écritures afin que vous soyez délivré de cette attitude injuste. Revêtez l'humilité de Dieu et battez Satan dans votre vie.  **\n\nMatthieu 18 verset 19 ,20  **\n« Je vous dis encore que si deux d'entre vous s'accordent sur la terre pour quelque chose qu'ils demandent, cela leur sera accordé par mon Père qui est dans les cieux.\nCar là où deux ou trois sont assemblés en mon nom, je suis au milieu d'eux.  **\n\n Vous avez prié contre cette maladie et elle ne vous a pas quitté. Vous avez prié et prié et prié. La Bible dit que deux valent mieux qu'un, car ils ont une bonne récompense pour leur travail. Obtenez une autre personne. Faire connaître la chose . En fait la chose est devenue si lourde pour vous, faites appel aux anciens. Les prières que les anciens de l'église prieront pour vous apporteront la guérison. Maintenant, entre vous anciens, apprenez à prier les uns pour les autres. (Confessez vos péchés) au cas où vous auriez fait quelque chose de mal qui bloque la guérison. Confessez-le à la personne ou à l'autorité appropriée. Priez les uns pour les autres et vous serez guéris.\n Les anciens ne sont-ils pas justes ? La prière du juste vaut beaucoup. Mais quelle prière ? La prière efficace et fervente. Pas cette prière occasionnelle dans laquelle beaucoup s'engagent. Prière efficace, prière prolongée et intense. Ça marche! Comme le dit l'Ecriture.  **\n\nJacques 5 verset 16 à 18  **\n16 Confessez vos fautes les uns aux autres, et priez les uns pour les autres, afin que vous soyez guéris. La prière efficace et fervente d'un homme juste est très utile.\n17 Élie était un homme sujet aux mêmes passions que nous, et il priait avec ferveur pour qu'il ne pleuve pas et il n'a pas plu sur la terre pendant trois ans et six mois.\n18 Et il pria de nouveau, et le ciel donna de la pluie, et la terre produisit son fruit.  **\n\nPar conséquent, cela pourrait être vous, cherchez la prière. Appelle ton frère. Dieu merci, il y a des gens qui ont les dons de guérison parmi les frères. Le Seigneur les a utilisés. N'ayez pas honte de les inviter ou d'aller vers eux. Dites-leur d'être d'accord avec vous dans la prière. Il y a des gens que le Seigneur a utilisés pour la délivrance. Parlez avec eux pour donner l'occasion de prier pour vous afin que le Seigneur détruise les œuvres de Satan dans votre vie et votre famille ou dans des affaires troublantes. Ne laissez pas votre esprit minimiser la grâce de Dieu dans la vie des gens. Vous n'êtes pas plus grand qu'eux en Christ. Ainsi, de cette façon, vous pouvez être guéri. Dieu est celui qui a arrangé cette prière pour le salut et à faire de cette façon. Lorsque la circonstance pour cela se présentera, l'esprit de grâce vous fera signe   Appelez quelqu'un d'autre ! Appelez quelqu'un d'autre ! Mais tant que vous dites \"Dieu, tu sais que je suis trop grand pour appeler quelqu'un. Dieu que tu es là. Dieu aime ce genre de défi de la part des orgueilleux   vous apprendre que sans humilité, vous n'êtes rien devant Lui. Alors laissez les autres apprendre qu'un « grand chrétien » comme vous reste malade à cause de la honte. Il n'y a pas de honte pour les justes. Soyez humble pour que Dieu vous emmène partout et fasse tout pour vous, au nom de Jésus.  **\n \niv.\tGrâce à l'utilisation de la médecine.  **\nDe nombreuses personnes reçoivent leur guérison corporelle de Dieu par la prière, la foi et l'utilisation de médicaments.   **\n\nEsaïe 38 verset 1 à 8, 21  **\n1 En ces jours-là, Ezéchias était malade à mort. Et Ésaïe, le prophète, fils d'Amots, vint vers lui, et lui dit   Ainsi dit l'Éternel   Mets ta maison en ordre, car tu mourras et tu ne vivras pas.\n2 Alors Ézéchias tourna sa face vers la muraille et pria l'Éternel, 3 et dit   Souviens-toi maintenant, Éternel, je t'en supplie, comment j'ai marché devant toi dans la vérité et avec un cœur parfait, et j'ai fait ce qui est bon à tes yeux. Et Ézéchias pleura amèrement.\n4Alors la parole de l'Eternel fut adressée à Esaïe, disant \n5 Va, et dis à Ézéchias   Ainsi a dit l'Éternel, le Dieu de David, ton père   J'ai entendu ta prière, j'ai vu tes larmes, voici, j'ajouterai à tes jours quinze ans.\n6 Et je te délivrerai, toi et cette ville, de la main du roi d'Assyrie, et je défendrai cette ville.\n7 Et ceci sera pour toi un signe de la part de l'Éternel, que l'Éternel fera ce qu'il a dit;\n8 Voici, je ramènerai l'ombre des degrés, qui est descendue dans le cadran solaire d'Achaz, de dix degrés en arrière. Ainsi le soleil revint de dix degrés, degrés par lesquels il était descendu.\n21 Car Esaïe avait dit   Qu'ils prennent un morceau de figues, qu'ils le mettent en plâtre sur le furoncle, et il se rétablira.  **\n\nCet homme juste de Dieu était malade et même Dieu a dit qu'il mourrait. Il n'était pas d'accord avec ce message. Il a dit   « Dieu, mon cœur n'est pas d'accord. J'ai toujours la conviction que je dois faire quelque chose de plus sur cette terre pour vous. Alors, s'il vous plaît Dieu, ne faites pas ça. Dieu a entendu sa prière. Peut-être que le Seigneur disait   « Ézéchias, il y a deux options maintenant. Voulez-vous mourir ou vivre encore ? Il a dit non! Je veux faire quelque chose de plus pour toi ici. Maintenant, je veux que vous appreniez quelque chose. Ézéchias était malade et par la réponse à la prière, Dieu a dit   « Je te guérirai. Cela ne s'est pas fait instantanément. C'est pourquoi Dieu devait donner un signe. La parole de Dieu à Ézéchias était   « Vous pouvez voir un retard dans l'accomplissement de ce que j'ai dit que je ferais. Laissez-moi vous faire signe. Ensuite, reposez-vous sur ce signe et ne vous en préoccupez plus. Il ira.'' Le Seigneur a fait reculer un peu le soleil. Je ne sais pas combien de temps il a fallu finalement pour que cette maladie s'en aille, mais elle est certainement partie. Lorsque le morceau de figues a été placé sur le furoncle, le Seigneur l'a guéri. L'utilisation de médicaments demande du temps et de la patience. Mais la guérison est venue. La guérison n'a pas eu lieu ce jour-là. Cela aurait pu être graduel jusqu'à ce que tout disparaisse, pour montrer que la parole qui sort de la bouche de Dieu ne revient pas à lui sans effet tant qu'elle n'a pas accompli ce que Dieu a dit. Mais rappelez-vous qu'il s'agissait d'un plâtre de figues. C'était de la médecine. Encore une fois, voyez une autre forme de médecine    **\n\nPremier Timothée 5 verset 23  **\n\"Ne bois plus d'eau mais utilise un peu de vin pour le bien de ton estomac et de tes fréquentes infirmités.\"  **\n\nLe vin dans le passage ci-dessus est un médicament. Il a la propriété de faire taire les problèmes d'estomac. Mais qu'en est-il de la foi ? La foi ne pourrait-elle pas le faire taire ? La prière de la foi ne pourrait-elle pas le faire taire ? Timothée a prié, cela n'a pas fonctionné. Il l'a révélé à Paul. \"Monsieur, il y a un problème d'estomac qui me dérange.\" Paul a prié, il n'a pas disparu. Maintenant, Paul a utilisé la sagesse. « Prenez peu de vin car si vous buvez de l'eau, cela a un effet mordant sur votre estomac. Le vin a un effet apaisant, un effet cicatrisant sur votre estomac. Dieu l'a fait ainsi pour notre bien. Cela ne se réfère pas au vin alcoolisé. Non. Parce que les boissons fortes sont trompeuses, vous ne pouvez pas en boire un peu. Si quelqu'un a mal à la tête et veut acheter des paracétamols à prendre, ne dites pas   « Frère, ne gaspillez pas votre argent, nous allons maintenant effacer ce mal de tête par la prière. » Ici, nous désirons vous faire savoir que prendre des drogues n'est pas contraire. à la volonté et à la parole de Dieu. Ne faites pas honte aux autres de prendre des médicaments et des traitements médicaux.  **\n\nv.\tDieu peut aussi guérir par sa souveraineté.  **\nL'homme étendu à la piscine de Béthesda n'a pas demandé la guérison. Quelqu'un a-t-il prié pour lui ? Non! Jésus est simplement venu et a dit   « Voudriez-vous être guéri ? Il pensait que c'était la guérison de la piscine et il a dit  \"Je n'ai personne pour me porter là-bas.\" Jésus lui a commandé   « Lève-toi et sois guéri. C'est ainsi que les gens sont guéris dans une croisade, pas pour leur droiture. Pas même parce qu'ils ont la foi. Pas même parce qu'on priait pour eux. Les pécheurs jouissent de cette miséricorde à cause du pouvoir souverain et de la volonté de Dieu.  **\n\n4.11 Raisons de ces expositions.  **\n\nje. Se conformer à l'instruction du Christ d'enseigner toutes choses.  **\n\nMatthieu 28 verset 18 à 20  **\n18 Et Jésus, s'approchant, leur parla, disant   Tout pouvoir m'a été donné dans le ciel et sur la terre.\n19 Allez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit ;\n20Enseignez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai prescrit, et voici, je suis avec vous pour toujours, jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amen  **\nPaul a également dit  \nColossiens I verset 28 à 29  **\n28 Lequel nous prêchons, avertissant chacun et enseignant chacun en toute sagesse; afin que nous présentions tout homme parfait en Jésus-Christ\n29 A quoi je travaille aussi, luttant selon son oeuvre, qui agit puissamment en moi.  **\n\nVous devez le savoir parce que le Seigneur a dit que nous devrions enseigner aux croyants tout ce qui est écrit dans les Écritures pour votre connaissance et votre pratique.  **\n\n ii. Pour garder les croyants de l'effet et du danger de l'ignorance.  **\n\nOsée 4 verset 6  **\n\"Les miens sont détruits par manque de connaissance. Beaucoup sont morts par ignorance.  **\n\nBeaucoup d'églises sont dans l'ignorance aujourd'hui ; leurs membres meurent. Où vont-ils ? Paradis ou enfer? L'enfer sûrement ! Parce qu'ils sont morts sous de fausses doctrines; ils sont morts sous la tromperie. Étaient-ils en Christ et en Sa Sainteté ? Ces gens qui ont été empêchés de prendre de la drogue   sont-ils tous justes ? Sont-ils enfants de Dieu ? La bible dit,  **\n\n2 Thessaloniciens 3 verset 2  **\n« Et que nous soyons délivrés des hommes déraisonnables et méchants ; car tous les hommes n'ont pas la foi.  **\n\nLes gens déraisonnables et méchants les ont bloqués. Ils se sont soumis à leurs dirigeants ignorants afin qu'eux aussi puissent avoir des positions et des reconnaissances dans l'église. Ils se gardent dans leurs maladies et y meurent. Ils meurent et vont en enfer. Ces églises ont aussi multiplié les hypocrites car il y en a qui ne peuvent pas obéir à la règle, mais prennent en privé des médicaments pour leur santé. Ceux-ci prétendent qu'ils sont fidèles à l'enseignement, mais sont des menteurs. Certains de ces prétendants sont les dirigeants de l'église qui font peser ce lourd fardeau sur les autres. Où est la justice qu'ils prétendent posséder et enseigner ? Dieu jugera ces dirigeants pour les jougs qu'ils ont imposés au peuple car, ce qui est pour leur bien, ce que Dieu a prévu pour leur santé, ils privent le peuple d'y avoir accès.  **\n\niii. Pour enlever la fierté et la honte des frères par rapport à la médecine et au traitement médical.  **\n\nMaintenant, vous avez honte de prendre de la drogue devant vos frères. Vous avez même honte d'aller chez le pharmacien. Tu as honte d'être à l'hôpital parce que tu te sens si bien. S'ils te demandent, frère, oh, tu viens à l'hôpital ? \"Non! non, je suis ici juste pour voir quelqu'un.'' C'est de la fierté. L'hôpital est une maison de miséricorde. C'est une maison où votre Dieu opère. Il déverse sa miséricorde sur les hommes. Es-tu fier d'être là ? Es-tu plus grand que Jésus qui travaille sur les gens là-bas ? Ils Le prient tous les jours et Il s'y rend pour répondre à leurs prières et démontrer Sa miséricorde.\nVous avez honte, mais vous souffrez de votre maladie et vous êtes en train de mourir. Vous avez besoin d'aide. Il est possible que votre cas ait été traité médicalement et que la maladie ou le fardeau familial ait disparu. Mais vous dites que vous ne voulez pas que les gens vous voient dans les hôpitaux ou les pharmacies. Dieu aime les humbles et hait les orgueilleux.  **\n\niv. Pour réprimander les accusateurs des frères qui les accusent d'utiliser la médecine (traditionnelle ou conventionnelle).  **\n\nCeux qui accusent les frères de prendre des drogues et des médicaments doivent être réprimandés parce qu'ils affectent les voies de Dieu. Ils sèment la confusion sur le chemin de la justice. \"Tout est à vous\". « Son Dieu l'enseigne ; son Dieu l'instruit à la discrétion ». Toutes choses ont été données gratuitement aux croyants pour qu'ils en jouissent. Alors, pourquoi accusez-vous les gens d'utiliser la médecine, conventionnelle ou à base de plantes, comme pour dire que c'est un péché ? Qu'est-ce qui en fait un péché ?\n\nLa même connaissance de la science que le Seigneur a donnée pour faire entendre le son, diffuser le son et amplifier le son afin qu'une grande foule puisse entendre sa parole, est la même qu'il a donnée aux scientifiques pour produire un avion afin que le voyage des années puisse être fait en un jour. La même connaissance qu'il a donnée aux scientifiques pour planifier et construire différents types de maisons, pour inventer le téléphone que vous pouvez maintenant utiliser pour communiquer avec des personnes éloignées de vous ; ce même Dieu a aussi donné à la science la connaissance de la médecine.\n\nPourquoi ne pas refuser d'entrer dans des véhicules, car c'est à l'homme qu'il a donné le savoir faire pour produire ou fabriquer les véhicules ? Pourquoi entrez-vous dans l'avion? Pourquoi utilisez-vous un microphone dans votre église ? C'est à l'homme qu'Il a donné ce sens pour produire ces choses que vous appréciez. Il a donné à l'homme la connaissance et la sagesse pour découvrir et produire des médicaments, conventionnels ou à base de plantes pour soigner les maux des gens et vous dites que c'est un péché ? Arrêtez de dire ça sinon vous offensez.  **\nvi.\tPour apporter la guérison à ceux qui sont malades depuis longtemps et qui résistent aux médicaments.  **\n\nIl y a des gens qui sont malades depuis longtemps surtout les nouveaux convertis. Lorsqu'on leur dit qu'ils n'ont pas besoin de médicaments, mais de foi seulement pour être guéris, ils célèbrent la nouvelle et refusent l'usage des médicaments. C'est une nouvelle foi. Cette foi n'a pas été testée. Avec le temps, ils arriveront à un point où ils ne pourront pas expliquer pourquoi certaines maladies ne disparaissent pas même après beaucoup de prières, mais ils ne voudront toujours pas prendre de médicaments parce qu'ils ont dit qu'ils vivraient par la foi et que les gens les avaient entendus. . Sachons que le Dieu qui répond à notre prière de foi a également fourni les médicaments (conventionnels ou à base de plantes) pour notre guérison et notre bonne santé et veut que nous les utilisions.  ** **\n\n\nCHAPITRE CINQ  **\nPHYTOTHÉRAPIE  **\n\n5.1 Arguments en faveur de la phytothérapie.  **\n\nLa phytothérapie est l'étude et l'utilisation des plantes médicinales ou naturelles, qui sont à la base de la médecine traditionnelle, pour soigner des maladies ou des affections.\nCertaines personnes disent que la phytothérapie n'est pas bonne. Qu'est-ce qui fait qu'il n'est pas bon ? N'utilisent-ils pas les plantes, leurs feuilles et leurs racines pour se nourrir ? À partir des mêmes herbes, vous vous soignez. Alors pourquoi disent-ils que ce n'est pas bon ? Beaucoup diront   « Comment est-ce arrivé ? D'où ont-ils obtenu les connaissances ? »\n\n\"Son Dieu l'enseigne et l'instruit à la discrétion.\" (Esaïe 28 verset 26)  **\n\nAllez demander à ceux qui ont bénéficié de ce don de Dieu, comment ils y sont parvenus et ils vous raconteront l'histoire. Vous pouvez seulement dire aux gens de ne pas participer à l'idolâtrie ou à l'ombre du sang pour quoi que ce soit dans l'utilisation de la phytothérapie pour éviter le démonisme. Ils ne doivent pas offrir de sacrifice ni payer pour cela, comme en offrant du poulet ou de la chèvre pour cela. \n\nQu'ont dit les disciples ? Ne troublez pas les gentils. Tout ce que vous devez leur dire, c'est qu'ils doivent s'abstenir de verser du sang et de sacrifier aux idoles et de manger des choses étranglées. C'est tout ce qu'il faut leur dire, et les laisser libres.  **\n5.2 Accepter les médicaments, les traitements médicaux et à base de plantes.  **\n\nMon peuple périt par manque de connaissance. Maintenant, vous êtes libre d'utiliser des médicaments, ayant connu la vérité. La médecine conventionnelle ou à base de plantes est un don de Dieu pour la santé humaine. Allez pour les opérations. Il y a des femmes qui ne veulent pas se faire opérer pour enlever un fibrome. Ils disent   « Pasteur, priez pour moi ; Je crois que Dieu peut le faire. La peur est le problème. Dieu a accordé la grâce à cet homme ou au scientifique médical (docteur) pour qu'il sache comment vous retirer un fibrome. Allez-y, et laissez-les faire. Remercions Dieu car toutes choses nous ont été librement données par Dieu. Les autres raisons de l'exposition sont les suivantes    **\n\ni.\tFaire taire doctrinalement ceux qui affirment que prendre des médicaments pour guérir est un péché.  **\nLa médecine, qu'elle soit conventionnelle ou à base de plantes, des compléments alimentaires ou autre, n'est pas un péché à prendre. L'utilisation de la médecine est bonne. Y a-t-il une preuve que quiconque prend un médicament commet un péché, ou une fois que vous le prenez, vous ne pouvez plus être juste ? Si cela peut être prouvé, alors nous pouvons dire que le mal est dedans et qu'il y a la mort dans le pot ! Ils sont en sécurité. Les croyants prennent des médicaments et sont guéris ou guéris, et ils continuent au service de Dieu.  **\n\nii. Pour que les frères jouissent de toutes les provisions de Dieu qu'Il a faites pour eux pour leur vie et leur ministère pieux.  **\nDeuxième Pierre 1 verset 2 à 3  **\n2 Grâce et paix vous soient multipliées par la connaissance de Dieu et de Jésus notre Seigneur,\n3 Selon que sa puissance divine nous a donné tout ce qui a trait à la vie et à la piété, par la connaissance de celui qui nous a appelés à la gloire et à la vertu  **\n\nVous avez un appel à servir Dieu. Si cette maladie continue, comment allez-vous exceller ? Allez-vous simplement permettre à la maladie de vous tuer en disant « si Dieu ne veut pas me guérir, laissez-moi mourir ? Connaissez-vous le prix de ces mots ?  **\n\n5.3 Brefs faits à noter et à retenir.  **\n\nje). Le Dieu qui a donné la connaissance de toutes choses pour la commodité humaine, la sécurité, la joie et la paix a donné la connaissance pour que la médecine soit découverte et produite pour la santé humaine.  **\n\n\nJacques 1 verset 17  **\n\"Tout don bon et tout don parfait vient d'en haut et descend du Père des lumières, chez qui il n'y a ni variation, ni ombre de changement.\"  **\n\nii). La médecine fait du bien à l'homme selon;  **\nProverbes 17 verset 22  **\n\"Un cœur joyeux fait du bien comme un médicament, mais un esprit brisé dessèche les os.\"  **\niii). Il existe deux types de médicaments; (a) des médicaments curatifs (b) des médicaments vénéneux.  **\n\nJérémie 30 verset 13  **\n« Il n'y a personne pour plaider ta cause, afin que tu sois lié ; tu n'as pas de médicaments de guérison.  **\n\n\"Tu n'as pas de médicaments de guérison\". Il y a des médicaments qui doivent empoisonner les gens, tuer les gens. Il y a des médicaments qui sont pour les destructions. Ceux-là sont du diable. Mais il existe des médicaments pour guérir. C'est le don de Dieu pour votre sécurité, pour votre paix et pour votre santé.\n\niv). Certains médicaments sont obtenus à partir d'herbes ou de feuilles d'arbres et d'autres créations naturelles de Dieu, comme on le voit dans le cas du roi Ézéchias. Un morceau de figues a été amené à bouillir et après un certain temps, l'ébullition a disparu et Ézéchias a vécu pendant plus d'années.  **\n\nEzéchiel 47 verset 12  **\n\"Et sur le bord du fleuve, sur son bord, de part et d'autre, pousseront tous les arbres pour la nourriture, dont la feuille ne se fanera pas, et dont le fruit ne se consumera pas, il produira de nouveaux fruits selon ses mois, parce que ils ont sorti leurs eaux du sanctuaire, et leurs fruits seront pour la nourriture, et leurs feuilles pour la médecine.  **\n\n\"... et son fruit sera pour la viande, et sa feuille pour la médecine.\"\nTu vois cela? Dieu qui a fait des arbres pour la nourriture en nous en donnant le fruit, donne aussi la feuille pour la médecine. Mais comment savoir quel arbre peut guérir ceci ou cela ? Dieu le fera savoir aux médecins et leur enseignera comment l'appliquer aux malades. Ceux à qui Il a confié ce devoir, Il les instruira discrètement afin qu'ils puissent enseigner aux autres.  **\n\nDeuxième Timothée 2 verset 2  **\n« Et les choses que tu as entendues de moi parmi de nombreux témoins, les mêmes te confient à des hommes fidèles, qui pourront aussi enseigner les autres. \"  **\n\nCertaines personnes le reçoivent par inspiration, tandis que d'autres l'apprennent d'eux. C'est ce que dit l'Écriture.  **\n\nJérémie 8 verset 22  **\n« N'y a-t-il pas de baume en Galaad ; n'y a t'il pas de physiciens ici? pourquoi donc la santé de la fille de mon peuple n'est-elle pas rétablie ?  **\n\nTu vois cela? Ils sont mon peuple. Je m'attendais à ce que, par l'utilisation du baume et l'utilisation d'un médecin parmi eux, la santé de mon peuple se rétablisse. Vous pouvez obtenir du baume de certains arbres et d'autres sources. Dieu donne cette connaissance. Il a créé les êtres humains et a pris des dispositions pour notre guérison dans sa sagesse.  **\nv). Les médecins utilisent des médicaments pour soigner les maladies.  **\n\nNous pouvons voir dans l'écriture ci-dessus   n'y a-t-il pas de baume (médicament) là-bas ? N'y a-t-il pas de médecin là-bas qui ait des connaissances en médecine? Les médecins ont la connaissance de l'application de la médecine.  **\n\nMatthieu 9 verset 12  **\n\"Mais Jésus, ayant entendu cela, leur dit  Ce ne sont pas ceux qui se portent bien qui ont besoin de médecin, mais ceux qui sont malades.\"  **\n\nExactement! Les malades vont voir des médecins qui utilisent des médicaments pour soigner les malades. Comment l'ont-ils appris ? Le Dieu du ciel leur a dit et certains les ont obtenus par l'apprentissage. Ils apprennent des autres et deviennent ainsi des médecins qui soignent les malades.  **\n\nvi). Les médecins ont de la valeur dans la société Les médecins ont de la valeur dans la société, qu'il s'agisse de médecins ou de médecins traditionnels.  **\n\nJob 13 verset 4  **\n\"Mais vous êtes des faussaires de mensonges, vous êtes tous des médecins sans valeur\".  **\n\nJob parlait à ses amis. \"Quand je vous ai vu, j'ai pensé que vous étiez des médecins de valeur qui peuvent guérir ma situation. Mais j'ai découvert que vous êtes des médecins sans valeur. Il y a des médecins qui ont de la valeur. Les gens les regardent ! Ils guérissent les gens. La société les respecte. Les médecins ont de la valeur et c'est pourquoi la Bible dit   « N'y a-t-il pas de baume en Galaad ; n'y a-t-il pas de médecins là-bas? pourquoi alors la santé de la fille de mon peuple n'est-elle pas rétablie ? C'est parce que les médecins ont une valeur dans la société.  **\nvii). Luc était médecin de profession et il était aimé et chéri par les apôtres pour sa profession. C'est pourquoi il s'appelait Le médecin bien-aimé. Les apôtres l'appelaient le médecin bien-aimé. Il est probable qu'ils ont apprécié ses services médicaux.  **\nColossiens 4 verset 14  **\n\"Luc le médecin bien-aimé et Démas, vous saluent.\"  **\nVoyez où est le bien-aimé. Est-ce sur \"Luke\" ou sur le \"médecin\" ? C'est sur le \"médecin\". Si cette phrase avait dit « bien-aimé Luke, le médecin », vous pourriez encore douter ; « Ce médecin d'une chose, y a-t-il quelque chose de bon là-dedans ? Peut-être le faisait-il avant la conversion.  **\nIl y a des frères qui sont dans un domaine ou dans l'autre qui sont parmi nous et peuvent rendre service aux frères ; les médecins aussi. Son service en tant que médecin était chéri parmi les frères, y compris Paul.  **\nviii). Jésus et tous ceux qui ont guéri les malades par la foi et au nom de Jésus sont des médecins au sens spirituel.  **\n Luc 4 verset 22, 23  **\n22 Et tous lui rendirent témoignage, et s'étonnèrent des paroles de grâce qui sortaient de sa bouche. Et ils dirent   N'est-ce pas le fils de Joseph ?\n23 Et il leur dit   Vous me direz sûrement ce proverbe   Médecin, guéris-toi tout ce que nous avons entendu faire à Capharnaüm, fais-le aussi ici, dans ton pays.  **\nJésus guérissait-il avec des médicaments ? Non! Mais en tant que Guérisseur, Il était médecin ! Ainsi, Dieu travaille à la fois spirituellement et physiquement. Ils sont tous à Lui. Il n'y a pas de domaine qu'Il a donné à Satan. Il a donné le domaine physique à l'homme et Il vient là et travaille avec l'homme dans le physique pour glorifier Son nom. Dans le spirituel, Il est en autorité et en contrôle. Il reste le Guérisseur. '... En mon nom, vous guérirez les malades ; vous chasserez les démons…'\nLes médicaments recommandés par les médecins traditionnels ou les phytothérapeutes ne sont pas des charmes ou des matériaux sataniques donnés dans la sorcellerie pour nuire ou protéger du mal, pour prospérer et réussir, ce qui peut damner son âme au feu de l'enfer. Au contraire, ils sont le don de Dieu pour la guérison.  ** **\n\n\nCHAPITRE SIX  **\nJÉSUS LE MÊME HIER, AUJOURD'HUI ET POUR TOUJOURS  **\n6.1 Jésus-Christ reste le guérisseur .  **\nActe 10 verset 36 à 38  **\n36 La parole que Dieu envoya aux enfants d'Israël, annonçant la paix par Jésus-Christ ; (Il est le Seigneur de tous  )\n37 Cette parole, dis-je, vous la connaissez, qui a été publiée dans toute la Judée, et qui a commencé en Galilée, après le baptême que Jean a prêché ;\n38 Comment Dieu a oint Jésus de Nazareth du Saint-Esprit et de puissance ; qui allait de lieu en lieu faisant du bien et guérissant tous ceux qui étaient sous l'empire du diable; car Dieu était avec lui.  **\nJésus est notre grand libérateur et guérisseur. Il va et vient, même maintenant, faisant le bien, guérissant les malades et délivrant ceux qui sont opprimés par le diable. Par la mention de son nom, les démons sont chassés, les malades sont guéris et le pouvoir des démons est brisé. Il reste le guérisseur pour toujours comme il l'était hier.  **\n6.2 Ses promesses continuent d'être vraies.  **\nEsaïe 46 verset 3 à 5  **\n3 Écoutez-moi, maison de Jacob, et tout le reste de la maison d'Israël, qui sont portés par moi dès le ventre, qui sont portés dès l'utérus.\n4 Et même jusqu'à ta vieillesse, je le suis ; et jusqu'aux cheveux blancs je te porterai   j'ai fait, et je porterai ; moi aussi je porterai et je te délivrerai.\n5 À qui me comparerez-vous, et me ferez-vous égal, et me comparerez-vous, afin que nous soyons semblables ?  **\nC'est ce que le Seigneur nous dit aujourd'hui, à nous ses enfants. Il parle à un peuple qui a cru en Lui. Il dit cela aux gens qui lui obéissent. C'est la voix du Seigneur pour vous. Dès l'utérus, Il vous a préservé. Tu n'es pas mort dans le ventre de ta mère, Il t'a fait naître. Par Sa grâce, vous avez vécu jusqu'à cet âge et jusqu'à ce temps. Maintenant, le Seigneur fait cette promesse, disant   même jusqu'à votre vieillesse, il restera fidèle. Le Dieu qui vous a gardé promet qu'il continuera à le faire même jusqu'à votre vieillesse et même jusqu'à vos cheveux blancs. Jusqu'à ce que tout ce qui concerne vos cheveux devienne blanc ! Le Seigneur a même dit à ces cheveux blancs   Il va te porter ; et il dit   J'ai fait et je porterai. Je t'ai créé, je porterai ta responsabilité. Il va vous porter et il va vous délivrer. La délivrance, la guérison que vous avez expérimentée des mains de Dieu toutes ces années se poursuivra dans votre vie jusqu'à la vieillesse, car c'est la promesse de Dieu pour vous.\nLa délivrance des accidents, des attaques de Satan et des démons, des sorcières et des sorciers dont vous avez joui toutes ces années, tout ce temps jusqu'à cet âge, vous continuerez à en profiter ainsi. Il continuera à vous porter même jusqu'à votre vieillesse. Il restera fidèle dans votre vie. Le Seigneur vous restera fidèle dans la vie ! Rassurez-vous, soyez tranquille. Avec qui Me comparerez-vous ? Allez-vous me comparer à un médecin ? Je Suis plus haut qu'un docteur! Avec qui allez-vous Me comparer ? Allez-vous Me comparer à un grand homme ? Je Suis plus grand que le plus grand homme ! Allez-vous Me comparer à l'argent ? Je suis plus grand que l'argent ! Avec qui allez-vous Me comparer ?\nJe dis que je vais prendre soin de ta vie. Je dis que je vais guérir votre vie. Je dis que je vais briser les jougs de votre vie. Je dis que je vais te délivrer. Je dis que je vais protéger ta vie. C'est la voix de Dieu ! C'est Dieu qui parle et je le crois. C'est la voix du Créateur. Voyons Jésus comme un fabricant. Il sait tout de vous. Le fabricant sait tout sur ce qu'il a fabriqué, la fonction de chaque partie du produit fabriqué. Lorsqu'il tombe en panne, il sait où se situe le problème et comment y remédier. Jésus vous connaît parce qu'il est votre créateur. Il sait quel est le problème dans votre vie. Les médecins peuvent ne pas le découvrir. Les instruments médicaux peuvent ne pas être en mesure de dire de quoi il s'agit. Mais le créateur sait. Il sait quand vous vous plaignez. Il a entendu le cri d'Ismaël quand Ismaël a été couché dans la brousse. Le Seigneur du sabbat, le grand Dieu a entendu le cri d'Ismaël. Il savait qu'Ismaël cherchait de l'eau. Il savait qu'Ismaël était en train de mourir faute d'eau. Le Seigneur était déterminé à faire vivre cet enfant. Le Seigneur est déterminé à vous faire vivre. Dieu est déterminé à vous faire survivre. Le Seigneur a fourni la solution. Il a dit à la mère Agar de tourner de l'autre côté et de voir et elle s'est retournée et a vu un puits d'eau.  **\nGenèse 21 verset 15 à 19  **\n15 Et l'eau s'écoula dans la bouteille, et elle jeta l'enfant sous l'un des buissons.\n16 Et elle s'en alla, et l'assit vis-à-vis de lui à une bonne distance, comme si c'était une flèche d'arc, car elle dit   Que je ne voie pas la mort de l'enfant. Et elle s'assit vis-à-vis de lui, et éleva la voix, et pleura.\n17 Et Dieu entendit la voix de l'enfant ; et l'ange de Dieu appela Agar du ciel, et lui dit  Qu'as-tu, Agar? n'ayez pas peur; car Dieu a entendu la voix de l'enfant là où il est.\n18 Lève-toi, relève l'enfant, et tiens-le dans ta main; car je ferai de lui une grande nation.\n19 Et Dieu lui ouvrit les yeux, et elle vit un puits d'eau ; et elle alla remplir la bouteille d'eau, et donna à boire au garçon.  **\n Il y aura une solution pour vous. Le Seigneur ouvrira un puits d'eau pour votre vie. C'est ce que dit le Seigneur. Il sait ce que vous traversez, votre douleur et votre inconfort. Il sait tout. N'est-ce pas Jésus qui a dit à Nathaniel   Avant que Philippe ne te rencontre, quand tu te tenais là sous l'arbre, je te connaissais. Nathaniel était surpris. Maître, alors tu es le Fils de Dieu. Est-ce vrai? Ensuite, vous allez voir plus de choses. Vous allez voir plus de gloire. Que vos yeux soient ouverts pour connaître Dieu, que vos yeux soient ouverts pour connaître Jésus, vous allez voir plus de gloire dans votre vie. Vous allez recevoir plus de visites de Dieu dans votre vie. Vous allez voir plus de manifestations de l'amour et de la puissance de Dieu, parce que vos yeux sont ouverts pour Le connaître. Il dit   Celui qui m'aime et garde ma parole, je l'aimerai, mon père l'aimera et nous viendrons habiter chez lui. Vous allez mieux connaître Dieu. Parce qu'il a placé son amour sur moi, je le délivrerai donc. Je serai avec lui en difficulté. Je le délivrerai et je lui sauverai la vie ! Parce qu'il a connu mon nom.  **\n6.3 Jésus Notre Docteur.  **\nExode 15 verset 25, 26  **\n25 Et il cria à l'Éternel; et l'Éternel lui montra un arbre qu'il jeta dans les eaux, et les eaux furent adoucies; là, il leur fit une loi et une ordonnance, et là il les éprouva,\n26 Et dit   Si tu écoutes attentivement la voix de l'Éternel, ton Dieu, et que tu fasses ce qui est droit à ses yeux, et que tu prêtes l'oreille à ses commandements, et que tu observes toutes ses lois, je ne mettrai aucune de ces maladies. sur toi, que j'ai fait venir sur les Égyptiens; car je suis l'Éternel qui te guérit.  **\nEncore une fois, prenez Jésus comme médecin. Mais plus qu'un médecin. Le médecin vous examine pour diagnostiquer votre maladie. Il peut avoir besoin de l'aide de certaines machines et de leurs opérateurs pour savoir exactement quel est le problème. Il vous prescrit ensuite les médicaments à prendre pour être bien. Mais Jésus fait plus que cela sur vous. Il connaît votre maladie. Il sait comment vous récupérer. Il a le pouvoir de vous récupérer. Aucune maladie ou problème n'est au-dessus de Son pouvoir de guérison. Le Seigneur a guéri beaucoup de gens avec votre genre de problème. Il veut que vous sachiez que votre cas est dans le domaine de la possibilité de solution. Il veut que vous sachiez que votre maladie ira toujours. Il veut que vous sachiez que votre problème sera toujours résolu. Tout ce que vous avez à faire est de croire.  **\n6.4 Jésus est votre libérateur.  **\n\nLuc 4 verset 18 ,19  **\n18 L'Esprit du Seigneur est sur moi, parce qu'il m'a oint pour prêcher l'Evangile aux pauvres ; Il m'a envoyé pour guérir les cœurs brisés, pour prêcher la délivrance aux captifs, et le recouvrement de la vue aux aveugles, pour remettre en liberté ceux qui sont meurtris,\n19 Pour prêcher l'année de grâce du Seigneur.  **\n L'esprit du Seigneur est sur moi. Il M'a oint. Jésus est l'oint de Dieu. L'esprit est venu sur Lui en tant qu'être humain, en tant que Serviteur de Dieu envoyé pour délivrer l'humanité, pour briser les jougs de Satan sur l'humanité. Jeune homme, bonne nouvelle pour vous. La puissance du diable qui détruit votre vie sera brisée par Jésus. Bien que vous vous déplaciez comme un fou, vous n'êtes pas sous contrôle, vous vous déplacez d'un endroit à l'autre comme poussé par le vent. Le Seigneur dit qu'il se soucie de votre vie. Il va arrêter le vent sauvage du diable. Il va demander à ces démons de quitter votre vie.   **\nL'esprit du Seigneur est sur moi, parce qu'il m'a oint pour prêcher l'évangile aux pauvres. Il m'a envoyé pour guérir les cœurs brisés, pour apporter la délivrance aux captifs et le rétablissement de la vue aux aveugles.\nLes gens qui sont en captivité, sauf par la puissance de Dieu, ils ne peuvent pas être libres. Et c'est pourquoi la puissance de Dieu agira sur vous. Vous voyez des gens marcher de long en large, ils marchent de haut en bas non volontairement. Certains pouvoirs y travaillent. Certaines personnes trouvent difficile de donner leur vie à Christ. Certains pouvoirs y travaillent. L'Éternel dit à Moïse   Dis à Pharaon que mon peuple sorte d'Égypte. Je les emmène dans un pays meilleur. Moïse revint et dit   Pharaon a dit qu'il ne vous connaît pas. Oui, je sais, Pharaon ne me connaît pas. Pharaon est têtu. Je vais étendre ma main sur l'Égypte, puis Pharaon vous laissera partir. Je vais étendre Mes mains sur les forces qui dispersent votre vie. C'est Dieu qui parle. Je vais étendre Mes mains, sur ces choses qui ont obscurci votre cœur, ces choses qui ont embrouillé votre vie. Je vais étendre Mes mains puissantes. Vous serez libre. Vous servirez le Seigneur. Vous allez sortir de cette obscurité satanique.  **\nLa puissance de Dieu vous fera naître de nouveau. Toutes ces chaînes du diable qui ont lié votre vie, le feu les brûlera; les démons qui travaillent contre votre vie seront détruits. Ces chaînes seront brûlées de votre vie au nom de Jésus ! C'est ce que le Seigneur va faire. Le Seigneur va vous libérer. Vous entendrez le bruit des os pendant que la parole du Seigneur continue. Il y avait du bruit dans la vallée et les os desséchés tremblaient. Vos os trembleront par le Seigneur. Le jugement de Dieu tombera sur vos ennemis. Le Seigneur brisera tout joug dans votre vie. Au nom de Jésus! Que le Seigneur vous libère. Continuez à servir le Seigneur. Le salut est par la puissance de Dieu. Qui est Pharaon qui a dit que le peuple n'irait pas ? Qui est ce diable, qui est cette sorcière ou ce sorcier ? Qu'avez-vous avalé dans votre corps qui résiste à votre liberté de servir le Seigneur ? Qu'ont-ils marqué sur votre corps ? Qu'ont-ils mis dans votre sang pour vous empêcher de servir le Seigneur ? Si vous êtes disposé à obéir au Seigneur, aucun pouvoir ne peut vous retenir.  **\nEsaïe 1 verset 19  **\n« Si vous êtes volontaires et obéissants, vous mangerez les biens du pays »  **\n6.5 Jésus est votre solutionneur de problèmes.  **\nL'Esprit du Seigneur est sur moi, parce qu'il m'a oint pour prêcher l'évangile aux pauvres. Il m'a envoyé pour guérir les cœurs brisés, pour prêcher la délivrance aux captifs et le rétablissement de la vue aux aveugles, et pour remettre en liberté ceux qui sont meurtris.  **\nC'est dommage que vous ayez déjà été blessé. Ils ont fait beaucoup de choses contre vous. Les charmes travaillent contre vous. Vous avez été meurtri. Vous avez été rendu confus dans votre esprit. Votre éducation a été interrompue. Ils vous ont arrêté grâce à des pouvoirs sataniques. Votre vie professionnelle en est affectée. Votre esprit est confus. Mais croyez et invoquez Jésus. De nouvelles choses vous arriveront. Le salut du Seigneur viendra sur vous. La délivrance de Dieu tombera sur vous. Vous serez délivré. Jésus le fera parce que vous l'avez connu. Vous avez connu son nom.  **\nPsaumes 91 verset 14  **\n\"Parce qu'il a mis son amour sur moi, je le délivrerai donc, je le placerai en haut, parce qu'il a connu mon nom.\"  **\nLe Seigneur vous a donné ce livre pour essuyer vos larmes. Il vous a donné ce livre pour réconforter votre cœur. Si vous croyez en sa parole et que vous l'invoquez, il vous délivrera des jougs du diable. Pourquoi? Il a besoin de vous. Il dit à ses disciples   Allez dans la ville, vous trouverez un âne ligoté. Lâchez-le avec son poulain. Quand le propriétaire vous demande, que se passe-t-il ? Dites que le Seigneur en a besoin.  **\nLe Seigneur a besoin de vous. Par conséquent, vos chaînes seront brisées. Toutes ces choses qui ont lié votre vie, la puissance de Dieu les brisera. Le Seigneur a besoin de votre vie, il veut vous utiliser. Le Seigneur veut se glorifier dans votre vie. Le Seigneur veut que vous le glorifiiez devant les hommes. Cet âne, le Seigneur va s'asseoir dessus. Ils vont habiller ce cul. Ils y mettront de beaux vêtements. Il sera décoré de quelques fleurs, pour le rendre plus beau, car il va porter le Grand Roi. Vous allez annoncer la venue du Grand Roi. Votre vie annoncera Jésus. C'est pourquoi vous sortez de cette boue fangeuse et de cette horrible fosse. Vous sortez de ce coven. Vous sortez de la sorcellerie.  **\nTa bouche prêchera Jésus. Vous sortez de la captivité du péché. Vous sortez de la captivité de la masturbation. Tous ces pouvoirs immoraux, ces pensées immorales, cette convoitise immorale dans votre cœur, le Seigneur les brisera. Il vous libérera. Gloire à notre Dieu. C'est ce que Jésus veut comme libérateur et résolveur de problèmes.  **\n6.6 Deux sortes de délivrance de Jésus-Christ.  **\nLe premier aspect est d'être délivré de l'oppression satanique. Le second doit être délivré de l'habitation ou de la possession satanique. Ceux-ci, le Seigneur les fera pour vous par sa grande puissance. Il vous délivrera complètement de l'oppression satanique et de l'habitation.  **\nJean 10 verset 10  **\n\"Le voleur ne vient pas, mais pour voler, et pour tuer, et pour détruire, je suis venu afin qu'ils aient la vie, et qu'ils l'aient plus abondamment.\" **\nPremier Jean 3 verset 8  **\n« Celui qui commet le péché est du diable ; car le diable pèche dès le commencement. Dans ce but, le Fils de Dieu a été manifesté, afin qu'il détruise les œuvres du diable.  **\nLes œuvres du diable dans votre vie, les œuvres du diable dans votre corps, le diable dans votre mariage et votre famille, elles seront détruites au nom de Jésus ! Jésus s'est manifesté afin qu'il puisse détruire les œuvres du diable dans votre vie, dans la mesure où vous êtes prêt à être délivré. Tout ce que vous devez faire pour être libéré de l'esclavage de Satan est de confesser et d'être prêt à abandonner vos péchés.  **\nHébreux 2 verset 14, 15  **\n14 Puisque donc les enfants ont part à la chair et au sang, il a aussi lui-même participé à la même chose ; que, par la mort, il puisse détruire celui qui avait le pouvoir de la mort, c'est-à-dire le diable ;\n15 Et délivrez ceux qui, par peur de la mort, étaient toute leur vie soumis à la servitude.  **\nVous êtes ses enfants. Il ne veut pas que vous soyez sous la servitude de Satan. Satan vous a menacé de mort. Satan a utilisé des hommes pour vous menacer de mort. Les rêves pointent toujours vers vous, que vous mourrez. La Bible dit que la raison pour laquelle Il est devenu un homme est pour qu'Il puisse détruire le diable qui vous a gardé sous la peur de la mort, sous la captivité de la mort. Dieu enverra la destruction sur le diable lui-même, les démons, l'homme, la femme, les enfants, les animaux, quiconque dit que vous allez mourir, ou libère la destruction sur vous ; Le jugement de Dieu viendra sur eux. Il déchaînera la destruction sur ces ennemis de votre âme. Il annulera la mort sur votre vie. La puissance de Dieu se déplacera pour briser vos jougs. Croyez seulement que la puissance de Dieu se déplace autour de vous et brise les jougs. Le Seigneur desserre les liens. Il vous libère. Il a brisé les jougs. Gloire à notre Dieu. Le diable fait beaucoup de choses pour vous apporter du chagrin, pour vous maintenir dans la douleur et la confusion. Les mauvais rêves vous ont dérangé. Cette femme vient toujours à vous pour coucher avec elle, cet homme qui vient à vous dans le rêve en disant qu'il est votre mari ; ce reproche revient au diable. Y a-t-il une force de sorcellerie quelque part par un homme ou une femme contre votre vie ? Vous êtes un enfant de Jésus le grand roi. Où sont-elles? Jésus est le Roi des rois et le Seigneur des seigneurs, le Dieu Jéhovah. Votre temps pour la liberté est venu. Votre Dieu est en colère contre vos ennemis. Tous les poisons circulant autour de votre corps s'arrêteront. Par la puissance de Dieu, ce mal doit cesser ! Vous qui avez perdu la mémoire et ne pouvez plus bien penser, parce que quelque chose a affecté votre cerveau. Le Seigneur vous a amené à son atelier. Vous êtes dans Son atelier et Il vous délivrera.  **\n6.7 Votre créateur vous délivrera.  **\nVous êtes toujours confronté à des échecs. C'est comme si vous n'y arriveriez pas dans la vie. Vous avez tourné à gauche; ça ne marche pas. Vous avez tourné à droite, cela ne fonctionne pas. Vous avez l'air confus et abandonné, aucune aide. Si mon père et ma mère m'abandonnent, le Seigneur me relèvera. Si vous n'avez personne sur terre, vous avez quelqu'un au ciel, Dieu. Celui qui vous a créé, Celui qui vous a formé. Une mère peut-elle oublier l'enfant de son ventre ? Certains peuvent oublier mais votre Dieu est avec vous. Votre lutte contre la masturbation recevra la victoire du Seigneur. Vous ne savez pas comment obtenir la liberté? Croyez Dieu. Invoquez-le avec foi et vous vous verrez libre. Dieu vous aidera. Le Dieu du Ciel connaît votre sincérité et comment vous luttez pour ne pas aller en enfer. Et certaines puissances des ténèbres l'ont entravé. Le Seigneur vient vous aider. Vous êtes toujours plein de peur. Peur de dormir seul, de bouger seul et de voyager. Cela vient du diable. Cet esprit de peur doit vous quitter aujourd'hui au nom de Jésus. Vous pouvez avoir le cas de l'obsession démoniaque. Votre esprit est pris en charge. C'est comme si vous ne pouviez pas tourner dans cette direction ou dans cette direction. Satan vient de s'emparer de votre esprit. Vous ne savez pas quoi faire. Le Seigneur brisera le pouvoir de Satan dans votre esprit et vous donnera la liberté. Tournez votre vie vers Jésus et recevez la liberté.  **\nCertaines personnes ont le problème de l'habitation démoniaque. Ton père, ta mère, tes parents, tes proches t'ont emmené chez un herboriste. Pour eux, ils vous protègent.  **\nIls ont commencé à fixer des démons dans votre corps en vous donnant divers charmes ! Maintenant, les démons sont entrés et vivent dans votre corps, donc vos voies sont corrompues. Vous-même ne pouvez pas bien vivre dans le monde. Vous ne pouvez pas vivre en paix. Vous voyez double. La vie ne vous convient pas parce que vous êtes porteur de mauvais esprits. Vous portez des mauvais esprits à cause de ces charmes dans votre vie, à cause de ces charmes que vous avez avalés dans votre estomac. Vous voyez maintenant les dommages qu'ils causent à votre vie. Vous voyez les êtres qui vous sont apparus dans la nuit. Vous voyez où vous vous trouvez. Très malheureusement, certains d'entre vous se tournent vers les serpents sans le savoir. Avant de savoir que vous vous trouvez dans un sérieux embarras, vous vous tournez vers un animal. Les gens savent que tu es un serpent. C'est dommage! Une vie de misère. Une vie de confusion. Un être humain qui a été confus et chassé de la société de la vie comme Nebucadnetsar, chassé dans la brousse. Ils vous ont gâté en mettant des choses indésirables dans votre vie. Vos yeux ne voient pas bien. Vos oreilles entendent le son de l'eau. Quelle honte d'être possédé ou habité par des démons, et d'être gardé dans le royaume de Satan.\nLe Seigneur fermera vos mauvais yeux. Le Seigneur brisera ces choses et vous libérera. Le Seigneur brisera vos jougs. Le Seigneur vous délivrera complètement. Il vous donnera une nouvelle vie. La puissance de Dieu brisera le joug. Ces choses sortiront de votre vie. Vous pourriez être devenu un esclave de Satan. Partout où des activités sataniques se déroulent, Satan vous envoie pour attaquer. Pouvez-vous résister à Dieu ? Vous êtes devenu un agent ou un garçon de courses pour Satan et les ténèbres. Mauvais emploi !  **\n6.8 Les misères de suivre Satan.  ** \nLes démons qui sont associés à Satan, le Seigneur les a poussés du ciel et ils ont des queues maintenant. Vous les voyez mal à l'aise. Toute gloire a disparu de leur vie. Le Seigneur les a chassés du ciel. Ils sont entrés dans votre vie pour faire de vous une créature maudite comme ils le sont. Alors que d'autres personnes dorment bien la nuit, vous passez une nuit blanche à voler. Mauvaise vie, misérable vie, vie confuse !\nUne histoire malheureuse d'une femme en sorcellerie a été racontée, qu'elle est tombée dans la journée à Lagos. Pauvre femme, Satan l'a embarrassée. Il y a aussi des garçons et des filles pauvres qui sont dans l'occultisme et le diable a enlevé la gloire de Dieu de leur vie. Le diable a mis de mauvais yeux dans leur corps. Le diable a mis diverses choses pour abuser de Dieu dans leur vie. Des gens pauvres et misérables. Pauvres filles, le diable les a emmenées à l'eau et elles les appellent sirènes ou reines de la côte. Ils ressemblent à des poissons; pauvres filles ! Satan a gâché votre vie et vous a rendu malheureux et confus. Si vous ne vous repentez pas, le feu de l'enfer vous attend. La douleur et le malheur de suivre Satan sont déchirants. Fuyez Satan. Criez à Dieu et Il vous délivrera. Le Seigneur vous fera miséricorde et Il changera votre vie ! Le Seigneur vous libérera de l'esclavage du diable. Puisse Dieu renverser cette alliance méchante et vous ramener à la vie, à la beauté et à la gloire de Dieu. Ce livre est l'atelier de Dieu. Vous êtes dans l'atelier du Seigneur. Le Seigneur répare les gens qui se soumettent à sa parole. Je vous prie de vous rendre disponible, afin que vous puissiez être réparé. Sinon, si vous continuez ainsi, votre mariage sera une misère. Votre mariage sera une confusion. Vos enfants souffriront si vous ne vous repentez pas. Ils vous trompent dans le royaume satanique que vous serez promu. Ils vous ont dit que si vous faites plus de mal, ils vous promouvront. Le mal peut-il promouvoir un homme ? L'échec peut-il être la raison de votre promotion dans l'école ? Comment le mal aux yeux de Dieu peut-il être la raison de votre promotion ? C'est un mensonge du diable. Mensonge!   **\n6.9 Rejeter l'habitation satanique et la sorcellerie.  **\nL'habitation démoniaque, la possession démoniaque est une mauvaise chose ! C'est une mauvaise chose à laquelle ils t'ont initié. Mieux vaut crier si vous découvrez qu'un ami vous a initié. Criez que le Seigneur vous sauve. Mais si vous fermez votre bouche, vous mourrez et irez en enfer. Les mêmes personnes vont même vous tuer. Vous avez été initié et au lieu de crier   « Sauvez-moi, sauvez-moi », vous dites que si vous parlez, ils vous tueront.\nQui sont-ils? Sont-ils votre créateur ? Ont-ils le pouvoir de vous tuer ? Confesser! Exclamer! Les ravisseurs vous transportent dans leur véhicule et vous avez rencontré des policiers qui les ont arrêtés pour vérifier le véhicule et les ravisseurs ont dit \"Si vous parlez, nous vous tuerons, nous vous tirerons dessus\". Veuillez crier pour votre délivrance. En présence de la police, ils ne peuvent pas vous tirer dessus. Exclamer! Vous serez sauvé. Criez et dites que je suis une sorcière, je suis un sorcier, je suis dans le royaume marin. Jésus aide, aide, aide ! Alors le Seigneur vous délivrera. Sinon, il n'y a pas de bon avenir pour vous. Votre avenir est mauvais. Votre avenir est regrettable. Satan a fait le pire dans votre vie.  **\n6.10 La puissance de Jésus est supérieure à celle de Satan.  **\nCertaines personnes deviennent folles; ils s'adonnent à la drogue – ils sont accros à la drogue et se déplacent comme des désespérés. Les gens sont raisonnables, mais ils ne le sont pas. Les gens s'habillent raisonnablement mais ils ne le font pas. Vous les trouverez près des ruisseaux, des maisons abandonnées, ainsi que des démons. Bien dommage pour eux. Ils ne sont pas là où sont les gens raisonnables. Ils ont été chassés au coin du monde. Ils ne peuvent sortir que la nuit ! Comment votre vie peut-elle être réduite à un tel niveau ? En tant que personne raisonnable, laisseriez-vous Satan détruire votre vie ? Au lieu de crier, pour sortir de sa main, vous avez plutôt peur qu'ils vous tuent. Le pouvoir de Jésus de vous délivrer est plus grand que le pouvoir de Satan de tuer ou de détruire. Pourquoi Satan ne vous a-t-il pas tué pendant tout ce temps ? C'est parce que Dieu lui résiste. Dieu est celui qui empêche Satan de vous faire du mal.\nIl existe une puissance supérieure à la puissance de Satan. Je vous présente la région de la sécurité. Venez là où il ne 'pleut' pas. La Maison de Dieu vous protégera de la pluie. C'est pourquoi je vous invite. Je vous appelle pour venir vous faire délivrer. N'allez plus dans ces endroits la nuit. Refusez-le. Parlez à Dieu de ces personnes qui vous dérangent. Le Seigneur s'occupera d'eux. Des personnes peuvent être envoyées pour vous surveiller, pour s'assurer que vous ne vous repentez pas, mais les anges de Dieu vous surveillent et sont plus forts que les démons et leurs agents humains. Ne craignez rien. Dieu prendra soin de ces gangs. Pour vous qui êtes envoyés comme agents pour espionner le peuple de Dieu et lui faire du mal, ou pour l'empêcher par la sorcellerie de ne pas servir Dieu, le Seigneur vous connaît et marque vos jours. Si vous n'arrêtez pas ces mauvaises œuvres et ne vous tournez pas vers Dieu, un jugement terrible vous attend et vous serez englouti par le feu de l'enfer. Pulsez et demandez à Jésus une nouvelle vie. Promettez-lui que vous lui obéirez et que vous le servirez pour le reste de votre vie. Cela vous fera profiter de nombreux avantages de Jésus et de la vie éternelle.  ** **\n\n\nCHAPITRE SEPT  **\nJÉSUS EST NOTRE GUÉRISSEUR  **\n7.1 Enlever les péchés et les maladies.  **\nMatthieu 8 verset 16, 17  **\n16 Le soir étant venu, on lui amena beaucoup de démoniaques ; et il chassa les esprits par sa parole, et guérit tous les malades;\n17 Afin que s'accomplît ce qui avait été dit par Ésaïe, le prophète, disant   Lui-même a pris nos infirmités et a porté nos maladies.  **\nJe suis si heureux que toutes les maladies de votre corps aient été déposées sur Jésus sur la croix. Je suis reconnaissant que Jésus soit venu emporter toutes les maladies dans votre corps. Je dis que Jésus est prêt à enlever votre maladie. Comme Il enlève les péchés des gens, Il enlève aussi les maladies des gens.  **\nPsaumes 103 verset 1 à 5  **\n1 Bénis le Seigneur, ô mon âme et tout ce qui est en moi, bénis son saint Nom ;\n2 Bénis le Seigneur, ô mon âme, et n'oublie pas tous ses bienfaits,\n3 Qui pardonne toutes tes iniquités; Qui guérit toutes tes maladies;\n4 qui rachète ta vie de la destruction; qui te couronne de bonté et de tendres miséricordes ;\n5 Qui satisfait ta bouche avec de bonnes choses; afin que ta jeunesse se renouvelle comme celle de l'aigle.  **\n\nLe Seigneur dit qu'il renouvelle votre jeunesse. Comme il enlève les péchés de la vie des gens, Il enlève aussi les maladies. Faites confiance au Seigneur et vous découvrirez que vous avez été guéri. Portez une attention particulière au Seigneur Jésus pendant que vous lisez la suite. Vous verrez vos maladies partir, partir, partir ! Alors qu'Il vous purifie des péchés, les maladies quittent aussi votre vie. C'est ce que Dieu veut faire pour vous. Il y a quelque chose que je veux vous faire savoir   guérir signifie enlever la maladie du corps. Il y a un moyen naturel que Dieu peut faire pour vous. Cela implique de prendre des médicaments, traditionnels ou conventionnels. Dieu utilise des hommes et des moyens pour apporter la guérison naturelle aux gens. Lorsque ces hommes et ces moyens sont purs sans influence démoniaque, vous profitez de leur service pour votre guérison.  **\n7.2 Prise de médicaments.  **\nC'est une bonne chose de prendre des médicaments. Certains membres de certaines églises confessionnelles peuvent croire que c'est un péché de prendre des médicaments. Il se peut qu'il n'y ait pas de gens justes dans de telles églises. C'est la manière du diable d'envoyer les gens en enfer. Par cette interdiction, lorsque l'injuste tombe malade, il ne prendra pas de traitement médical et ainsi mourra dans ses péchés et ira en enfer. Si vous dites dans notre église que nous ne prenons pas de médicaments, vous mourrez et irez en enfer. Vous n'êtes pas encore prêt pour le ciel. Le diable veut écourter votre vie. C'est lui qui a dit à vos aînés ou à vos pères fondateurs d'enseigner contre l'usage de la médecine. Mais que disent les écritures ?\nProverbes 17 verset 22 ; Un cœur joyeux fait du bien comme un médicament, mais un esprit brisé dessèche les os.  **\nUn cœur joyeux fait du bien comme un médicament. La médecine fait du bien à un homme, soulage un homme. Une personne qui rit de tout son cœur est détendue. Cela le soulage des tensions. Ça fait du bien comme un médicament. Et cela vous dit que la médecine est une bonne chose. Cela fera du bien dans votre vie. Il n'y a rien de mal à prendre du Panadol ou du paracétamol. Il n'y a rien de mal à prendre des médicaments pour votre problème d'estomac. Il n'y a rien de mal à aller à l'hôpital et à se faire opérer. Il n'y a rien de mal, car tout est à vous. La sagesse de Dieu nous a donné les médecins et les médecins traditionnels pour en profiter, tout comme vous appréciez les bénédictions de Dieu des autres sciences   la science mécanique, la science chimique, la science biologique et toutes. La science médicale doit aussi être appréciée parce que Dieu l'a pourvue. Toutes les bonnes choses sont à vous.  **\n1 Corinthiens 3 verset 22  **\n« Soit Paul, soit Apollos, soit Céphas, soit le monde, soit la vie, soit la mort, soit les choses présentes, soit les choses à venir ; tout est à vous ; »  **\nN'écoutez pas ces gens qui enseignent autrement en disant   « Je suis un enfant de Dieu, je ne prendrai pas de médicaments, j'ai la foi ». Est-ce vrai ? N'est-ce pas Paul qui a dit à Timothée de ne pas prendre d'eau mais un peu de vin pour ses maux d'estomac ? Est-ce que Timothée n'avait pas la foi ? Paul qui avait prié pour les malades au point que même des mouchoirs de ses mains guérissaient les malades, avait prié pour Timothée. Pourtant, il lui ordonna de prendre un peu de vin sans alcool, un produit naturel que Dieu a créé avec des propriétés curatives. A-t-il dit non au conseil inspiré de Paul ? Qui sait si Dieu a délibérément refusé de guérir Timothée par la prière uniquement afin d'enseigner ce principe aux croyants ?  **\nQuand nous grandissions dans notre vie chrétienne, nous avons dit que nous ne prendrions pas de médicaments. C'est devenu une fierté. Nous témoignions   « En fait, depuis deux ans, je n'ai pas pris de drogue. C'était la fierté, certains pécheurs n'ont même pas pris de drogue depuis dix ans. Qu'en est-il? Ce n'est pas de la foi pour eux mais de la chance. Ce n'est pas le corps de tout le monde qui est sujet à la maladie ! Certaines personnes vivent sainement sans prendre de drogue, pourtant des pécheurs ! Donc, ce n'est pas nécessairement à cause de votre foi. Non pas que la foi ne puisse pas fonctionner. La foi fonctionne parfaitement mais obtenez la sagesse, allez avec sagesse, sinon, vous périrez dans votre maladie.  **\nIl existe certaines maladies qui, si elles sont contractées, peuvent être traitées médicalement. Bien que vous ayez prié sérieusement à ce sujet mais que vous souffriez toujours, le Seigneur a dit que l'hôpital est là pour vous. J'ai également pris cette disposition. Mais vous dites, Seigneur, vous devez me guérir, pas l'hôpital. Allez-vous forcer Dieu ? Allez-vous instruire Dieu ? Plus vous tardez à prendre des médicaments, plus cela est dangereux pour vous. Un point à temps en vaut neuf! Si vous réglez cette affaire maintenant, les dommages qu'elle vous causera à l'avenir seront évités. Mais si vous ne le réglez pas maintenant, cela peut s'aggraver. Cela peut s'aggraver et vous affecter de bien d'autres façons. Cela affectera votre mariage et d'autres activités. Cela peut affecter votre longévité. Cela vous affectera dans de nombreux domaines. Pourquoi? A cause de votre bêtise ! La folie est liée dans le cœur d'un enfant (un novice). C'est pourquoi vous devez le savoir. Là où vous avez besoin d'utiliser des médicaments, soyez libre de le faire. C'est la volonté de Dieu pour vous. Mais si vous avez reçu une forte conviction de guérison de Dieu sans l'usage de drogues, tant mieux. La foi produit des preuves et des manifestations dans un temps donné. Ne laissez pas votre situation s'aggraver lorsque les médicaments peuvent vous apporter une solution.  **\n7.3 Le malade a besoin d'un médecin.  **\nMatthieu 9 verset 12  **\n\"Mais Jésus, ayant entendu cela, leur dit  Ce ne sont pas ceux qui se portent bien qui ont besoin de médecin, mais ceux qui sont malades.\"  **\nComprends-tu cela? Ceux qui sont entiers et en bonne santé n'ont pas besoin de médecin. Mais ceux qui sont malades, dit le Seigneur, ont besoin d'un médecin. Le Seigneur dit qu'ils ont besoin de soins médicaux. Le Seigneur dit que vous avez besoin d'un médecin. Convainquez-vous que vous avez besoin d'un médecin. Mais si vous n'êtes pas malade, vous n'en avez pas besoin. Homme de Dieu, dans la superficialité spirituelle, tu dis   « Je suis le pasteur de ce peuple. S'ils me voient prendre des médicaments, leur foi en sera affectée.'' Es-tu celui qui va édifier la foi en eux ? Êtes-vous le propriétaire de la foi? Pourquoi parles-tu ainsi ? C'est la parole de vérité. Faites la vérité et enseignez la vérité aux gens.\nEncore une fois, dit le Seigneur, celui qui est malade a besoin d'un médecin, d'un docteur. Est-ce que ces médecins sont ceux qui ont fréquenté les facultés de médecine? Les médecins sont-ils uniquement ceux qui fréquentent l'enseignement formel ou les écoles ? Non! Il existe aussi des médecins traditionnels. Ils ne sont pas allés à l'école mais l'ont appris par héritage de leurs pères. Ils ont appris comment les gens peuvent être guéris des maladies ! Ils sont spécialisés dans les médecines alternatives. Vous trouvez des gens qui peuvent panser les os même si la jambe est complètement cassée. Les avez-vous vus quelque part ? Ils peuvent très bien habiller les os. Beaucoup d'entre eux sont meilleurs que les médecins conventionnels dans les hôpitaux. Ce sont aussi des médecins ! Alors que ce soit la médecine conventionnelle ou la médecine traditionnelle ; une fois qu'il n'a aucun lien avec Satan ou les démons, et que l'homme ne s'est pas donné aux démons, ne vous dit pas d'obéir aux lois démoniaques, mais aux lois naturelles, c'est une médecine propre. C'est le don de Dieu pour vous. Le Seigneur l'a donné.  **\nJacques 1 verset 17  **\n\"Tout don bon et tout don parfait vient d'en haut et descend du Père des lumières, chez qui il n'y a ni variation, ni ombre de changement.\"  **\n7.4 La médecine traditionnelle a été la première.  **\nAvant que les gens ne commencent à fréquenter l'éducation formelle ou les écoles, comment se guérissaient-ils ? Dans une société civilisée, ils emmènent les animaux dans les hôpitaux. Mais qu'en est-il des non-civilisés ? Que font les animaux ? Les animaux sauvages sont-ils aussi malades ? Comment se guérissent-ils ? Ils savent quoi faire. Ils connaissent les feuilles à manger. Ils vont cueillir ces feuilles. Avez-vous vu un animal cueillir des feuilles pour se soigner ? Donc, avant l'arrivée de la médecine conventionnelle; avant que les gens n'aillent à l'école pour l'apprendre, il y avait des gens qui connaissaient la combinaison des feuilles et des racines pour soigner diverses maladies. Là où cela se fait naturellement bien et proprement, c'est pour vous. L'Écriture le confirme.   **\nJérémie 30 verset 12, 17  **\n12 Car ainsi dit le Seigneur   Ta meurtrissure est incurable, et ta plaie est grave.\n17 Car je te rendrai la santé, et je te guérirai de tes blessures, dit le Seigneur ; parce qu'ils t'ont appelé un proscrit, disant   c'est Sion, que personne ne recherche.  **\nJe te rendrai la santé. L'une des façons dont cela est fait peut être vue dans l'Écriture suivante.  **\nEzéchiel 47 verset 12  **\n« Et sur le bord du fleuve, au bord de celui-ci, de part et d'autre, pousseront tous les arbres pour la nourriture, dont la feuille ne se fanera pas, et dont le fruit ne se consumera pas, il produira de nouveaux fruits selon ses mois, parce que ils ont sorti leurs eaux du sanctuaire, et leurs fruits seront pour la nourriture, et leurs feuilles pour la médecine.\n Les feuilles de ces arbres peuvent être utilisées pour guérir. La cure à base de plantes est du Seigneur. Vous êtes libre de l'utiliser.  ** **\nCHAPITRE HUIT  **\nLA GUÉRISON PAR LA FOI ET LA PRIÈRE  **\n\n8.0 La foi doit aller avec la prière.  **\nHébreux 11 verset 1,2  **\n1 Or la foi est l'assurance des choses qu'on espère, la preuve de celles qu'on ne voit pas.\n2 Car par elle les anciens ont obtenu un bon rapport.  **\nJacques 2 verset 20, 26  **\n20 Mais sauras-tu, ô homme vain, que la foi sans les œuvres est morte ?\n26 Car, comme le corps sans l'esprit est mort, de même la foi sans les oeuvres est morte aussi.  **\nIl existe divers domaines de guérisons que Dieu donne à ses enfants, comme on peut le voir dans les discussions ci-dessous     **\n8.1 Guérison des maladies et maladies.  **\nDieu guérit aussi de manière surnaturelle par la foi et la prière. C'est ce que Jésus a fait quand il est venu. Cependant, les croyants doivent prier avec ferveur sans cesse pour l'intervention de Dieu dans leurs cas. La guérison par la foi et la prière est ce que Jésus a fait à ses enfants jusqu'à ce jour.  **\nMatthieu 11 verset 2 à 5  **\n2 Or, lorsque Jean eut entendu dans la prison les oeuvres de Christ, il envoya deux de ses disciples,\n3 Et lui dit   Es-tu celui qui doit venir, ou en attendons-nous un autre ? 4 Jésus répondit et leur dit   Allez et rapportez à Jean ce que vous entendez et voyez ;\n5 Les aveugles recouvrent la vue, et les boiteux marchent, les lépreux sont purifiés, et les sourds entendent, les morts ressuscitent, et l'Evangile est annoncé aux pauvres.  **\nLa guérison divine a lieu jusqu'à ce moment parce que Jésus est toujours le Messie. C'est le signe du Messie pour toute l'humanité, pour toutes les générations. Les aveugles retrouvent la vue, les lépreux sont purifiés. Diverses sortes de maladies sont guéries. Tout le monde peut être guéri par la puissance du Seigneur Jésus. Cela vous inclut!  **\nMatthieu 9 verset 27 à 30  **\n27 Et lorsque Jésus partit de là, deux aveugles le suivirent, criant et disant   Fils de David, aie pitié de nous.\n28 Et quand il fut entré dans la maison, les aveugles s'approchèrent de lui, et Jésus leur dit   Croyez-vous que je suis capable de faire cela ? Ils lui dirent   Oui, Seigneur.\n29 Alors il toucha leurs yeux, disant   Qu'il vous soit fait selon votre foi. 30 Et leurs yeux s'ouvrirent; et Jésus leur enjoignit sévèrement, disant   Prenez garde que personne ne le sache.  **\n« Selon votre foi... » Tout ce que le Seigneur veut faire, c'est raviver votre foi ! Au fur et à mesure que vous lisez, préparez-vous à ce que Jésus vous guérisse. Priez pour cela. Comme ces hommes aveugles sont venus à Jésus et ont demandé miséricorde et ont exigé la guérison, afin que leurs yeux puissent être ouverts. Il leur a demandé s'ils croyaient qu'il pouvait le faire. Ils lui ont répondu, nous avons cru. Très simple! Il a dit  \"D'accord, prends-le.\" Leurs yeux s'ouvrirent immédiatement. Votre maladie partira immédiatement. Comme vous confessez une foi très simple en Jésus et dites   « Oui Seigneur, je crois. Cela sera fait et ces choses disparaîtront de votre vie au nom de Jésus!  **\n8.2 Guérir des fardeaux et des souvenirs nocifs.  **\nLe deuxième type de guérison que Jésus donne à ceux qui croient et le cherchent est la guérison des fardeaux et des souvenirs nocifs.  **\nMatthieu11 verset 28 à 30  **\n28 Venez à moi, vous tous qui êtes fatigués et chargés, et je vous donnerai du repos.\n29 Prenez mon joug sur vous, et apprenez de moi ; car je suis doux et humble de cœur et vous trouverez du repos pour vos âmes.\n30 Car mon joug est doux, et mon fardeau est léger.  **\nIl peut y avoir des fardeaux dans votre vie. Vous travaillez sur ce fardeau. C'est dans votre conscience. Vous vous réveillez tous les jours. C'est un fardeau. Il est entré dans votre subconscient. Vous portez un problème sur; quelque chose ne va pas et comment surmonter le problème devient difficile pour vous. Vous vous demandez   « Comment puis-je sortir de ce problème dans ma vie ? Votre vie reste insatisfaite. Ce trouble est entré dans votre subconscient. C'est un problème en quête de guérison. Cela implique des souvenirs passés.\nQuelqu'un a fait quelque chose contre toi, contre quelqu'un que tu aimais. Ça te fait très mal. Chaque fois que vous vous souvenez de cette chose, vous n'êtes pas vous-même. Peut-être que cela s'est transformé en un esprit impitoyable qui travaille maintenant dans votre vie. Vous ne savez même plus quoi faire. Chaque fois que vous voyez cette personne, votre corps tremble. Beaucoup de choses s'y sont accumulées. Cela a toujours un effet sur votre vie.\nC'est peut-être quelque chose que vous avez mal fait. Peut-être que vous avez tué quelqu'un. Tu as fait quelque chose de très mal. Chaque fois que vous vous en souvenez, vous n'êtes pas vous-même. Vous avez essayé d'en rire mais cela ne fonctionne pas. Tu t'es dit   laisse-moi en faire un autre pour que je m'y habitue ; Mais ça ne fonctionne pas. Tu es confus. Vous souffrez à cause du souvenir du passé. Vous avez maintenant peur ! Il y a une peur en vous concernant l'avenir. Ce qui cause cette peur vous a en fait vaincu. Vous êtes assis dans l'église et vous n'êtes pas sécurisé. Vous interagissez entre les membres, mais vous ne vous sentez pas en sécurité, tout cela à cause de quelque chose qui vous est arrivé ou que vous avez mal agi.\nPeut-être qu'en tant que femme, vous avez été violée quand vous étiez jeune. Ton oncle a couché avec toi ou c'est peut-être ton père. Cela vous a profondément endommagé. Maintenant que vous êtes encore mariée, chaque fois que votre mari vous touche, votre corps tremble et vous dites   « Qui me touche ? Jésus vous guérira. Au fur et à mesure que les médecins effectueront des opérations, c'est ainsi que le Fils de Dieu vous opérera et vous enlèvera ce problème ou ce fardeau.  **\n8.3 Guérison du subconscient  **\nEsaïe 43 verset 18, 19  **\n18 Ne vous souvenez pas des choses anciennes, et ne considérez pas les choses anciennes.\n19 Voici, je vais faire une chose nouvelle; maintenant il va jaillir; ne le saurez-vous pas ? Je ferai même un chemin dans le désert, et des fleuves dans le désert.  **\n Un esprit subconscient remarque et mémorise des informations lorsque l'on n'essaie pas activement de se souvenir de l'information et influence son comportement sans s'en rendre compte. Lorsqu'un problème affecte le subconscient d'une personne, son comportement peut également être affecté négativement.  **\nLe Seigneur vous amènera à un point où vous ne vous souviendrez plus de ces choses. Le Seigneur guérira votre culpabilité. Il vous libérera complètement. Lorsque le Fils de Dieu vous libérera, vous serez vraiment libre. C'est ce que le Seigneur veut faire pour vous libérer des souvenirs du passé. Les nombreux péchés commis, l'avortement commis, le mal fait par vous, ou fait par d'autres contre vous, Il va libérer votre conscience et votre subconscient de l'emprise de ces choses, afin que vous puissiez recevoir la liberté intérieure, la paix et l'absence de culpabilité par le pouvoir de Sa parole.  **\n8.4 Recevoir la délivrance et la guérison.  **\nMatthieu 8 verset 1 à 3  **\n1 Lorsqu'il fut descendu de la montagne, de grandes foules le suivirent. 2 Et voici, un lépreux vint et se prosterna devant lui, en disant   Seigneur, si tu le veux, tu peux me rendre pur.\n3 Et Jésus étendit la main, et le toucha, disant   Je veux ; sois pur. Et aussitôt sa lèpre a été nettoyée.  **\n'…Et aussitôt sa lèpre a été nettoyée. '' Que dit ce verset ? Il nous dit que Jésus est pour vous. Il t'aime tellement. Il ressent vos blessures, vos douleurs et il est disposé à vous recevoir. Il est prêt à pardonner et à vous délivrer. Il est prêt à vous guérir. Jésus tend sa main d'amour et de puissance vers vous. Il dit que vous devriez venir à Lui pour votre délivrance. Il dit   « Venez à moi pour être délivré de Satan, des péchés, de la maladie. Il est prêt à vous sauver. Ce que vous devez faire, c'est une véritable confession et un repentir. Abandonnez vos péchés et votre mauvais œil et tournez-vous vers Jésus pour votre salut et votre délivrance. Lorsque ce lépreux dit   Seigneur, si tu veux, rends-moi pur, Jésus dit aussitôt   Mon fils, je le veux. Comment ne serais-je pas disposé ? Je t'ai fait. Je t'ai créé dans le but de ma gloire. La lèpre vous a éloigné des gens. Je suis disposé à ce que vous reveniez dans l'humanité, que vous vous mêliez à eux et que vous fassiez Mon travail, Je veux que vous prêchiez Mon évangile. Je suis disposé, mon fils. Soyez purifié ! Et l'homme a été purifié immédiatement ! \nÀ partir d'aujourd'hui, alors que vous priez Dieu, croyez que vous l'avez et vérifiez les réponses. Pendant que vous priez, vérifiez toujours votre vie chrétienne également. Croyez que vos maladies disparaîtront ; les démons s'envoleront. Demandez à Dieu de vous bénir vraiment. Mais vous devez également remplir les conditions pour recevoir les bénédictions de Dieu. Vous devez vous repentir de votre vie méchante et mauvaise.  **\nActes 8 verset 20 à 23  **\n20\tMais Pierre lui dit   Ton argent périt avec toi, parce que tu as pensé que le don de Dieu peut être acheté avec de l'argent.\n21\tTu n'as ni part ni lot dans cette affaire car ton cœur n'est pas droit devant Dieu.\n22\tRepentez-vous donc de cette méchanceté, et priez Dieu, si peut-être la pensée de votre cœur peut vous être pardonnée.\n23 Car je vois que tu es dans le fiel de l'amertume et dans le lien de l'iniquité.  **\n\nEs-tu lié par l'iniquité ? Le diable a-t-il mis de l'amertume dans ton cœur ? Le diable a-t-il mis de la colère dans ton cœur ? Êtes-vous un pécheur? Le Seigneur dit que vous devez vous repentir. Il est prêt à vous faire miséricorde. Le Seigneur est disposé à vous pardonner. Ne vous attachez pas à la sorcellerie ou à l'occultisme. Ces choses vous damnent, vous et votre famille. C'est pourquoi le Seigneur dit que vous devriez vous repentir et changer votre vie.  **\n\n8.5 Confession pour la délivrance  **\n\nActes 19 verset 18 à 20  **\n18 Et beaucoup de ceux qui avaient cru vinrent, et confessèrent, et montrèrent leurs actions.\n19 Beaucoup d'entre eux aussi, qui usaient d'art curieux, rassemblèrent leurs livres, et les brûlèrent devant tous, et ils en comptèrent le prix, et trouvèrent cinquante mille pièces d'argent.\n20 Ainsi croissait puissamment la parole de Dieu et l'emportait.  **\n\nToutes ces choses magiques que vous avez, ces propriétés de sorcellerie que vous portez ou que vous mettez dans votre corps, soyez disposés à les confesser. Celui que vous portez dans votre poche décide d'avouer et de les laisser partir. Ceux qu'ils ont mis en coven pour vous, révélez-les et renoncez-y. Ceux que vous avez mis dans votre boîte dans votre maison, ceux que vous avez injectés dans votre sang, ceux que vous avez avalés, confessez-les devant Dieu et devant les vrais serviteurs de Dieu pour votre délivrance. Ces instruments de magie, instrument de sorcellerie, de destruction, que vous portez, la marijuana que vous avez encore, les drogues, celles que vous transportez, avouez et jetez ces choses ou brûlez-les. Si vous faites cela, c'est alors que vous cherchez Jésus. C'est alors que vous regrettez votre vie de péché. C'est alors que vous cherchez la miséricorde et le Seigneur vous pardonnera. Il vous recevra. Alors le Seigneur ordonnera au diable de sortir de votre vie parce que vous êtes sincère. Car celui qui cache son péché ne prospère pas. Si vous cachez votre sorcellerie, vous ne prospérerez pas.  **\n\nVous pourriez avoir été dans la sorcellerie avant de devenir un ouvrier d'église et même un prédicateur, et avoir essayé en vain d'en sortir. Vous n'avez pas pu réussir parce que vous l'avez caché tout ce temps. Vous avez géré votre vie dans le péché. Vous êtes comme un homme dans une fosse, une fosse terrible qui ne peut pas se délivrer. Il faut une puissance hors de la fosse pour le délivrer. Vous êtes dans la fosse du diable. Appelez à l'aide de l'extérieur. Laissez votre voix venir aux gens à l'extérieur pour vous aider à sortir de la fosse. Ce sont les gens qui sont à l'extérieur qui peuvent vous faire sortir de cet endroit. Mais si vous gardez le silence dans la fosse parce que vous vous considérez comme un « grand homme », vous y mourrez. Vous mourrez et périrez. Alors, confessez vos péchés ! Faites-le devant l'église et le ministre de Dieu. Si vous recherchez le salut et la délivrance du Seigneur, alors exercez votre foi au Seigneur Jésus. Invoquez-Le pour votre guérison et votre délivrance de toutes les maladies et opérations sataniques. Croyez que la prière de son serviteur oint au nom du Seigneur Jésus vous rendra libre et vous guérira.  **\n\nMatthieu 10 verset 1  **\n« Et quand il eut appelé à lui ses douze disciples, il leur donna le pouvoir contre les esprits impurs, de les chasser et de guérir toutes sortes de maladies et toutes sortes d'infirmités. \"  **\n\nJe suis disciple et serviteur du Christ. Il m'a donné le pouvoir. Je parlerai, et la puissance de Dieu le fera. Je commanderai et le pouvoir le fera. C'est-à-dire, croyez que cela arrivera par le serviteur de Dieu pour votre vie. Et vous le verrez s'accomplir au nom de Jésus.   **\n\nMarc 16 verset 15, 16  **\n15 Et il leur dit   Allez par tout le monde, et prêchez l'Evangile à toute créature.\n16 Celui qui croira et sera baptisé sera sauvé; mais celui qui ne croira pas sera damné.  **\nSi vous n'êtes pas encore baptisé dans l'eau, après avoir satisfait à l'exigence d'être baptisé, et que vous vous vantez d'être chrétien, rappelez-vous que si vous mourez, vous n'irez pas au ciel. N'étant pas baptisé, vous n'obéissez pas à ce commandement. ...Celui qui croit et qui est baptisé... Si vous avez cru, pourquoi n'êtes-vous pas baptisé? C'est de la désobéissance. Si vous vous êtes vraiment repenti de vos péchés et avez accepté Christ, quelle est la raison pour laquelle vous ne vous êtes pas fait baptiser ? Ne jouez pas avec le baptême d'eau. Si vous avez cru en Christ mais n'avez pas été baptisé correctement ou avez été baptisé alors que vous étiez incroyant ou enfant, maintenant que vous avez cru ou atteint l'âge de la majorité, faites-vous baptiser. C'est la volonté de Dieu pour vous.  **\n\nMarc 16 verset 17 à 20  **\n17 Et voici les miracles qui accompagneront ceux qui auront cru ; En Mon Nom ils chasseront les démons ; ils parleront de nouvelles langues;\n18 Ils prendront des serpents; et s'ils boivent quelque chose de mortel, cela ne leur fera pas de mal; ils imposeront les mains aux malades, et ils seront guéris.\n19 Ainsi donc, après que le Seigneur leur eut parlé, il fut élevé au ciel et s'assit à la droite de Dieu.\n20 Et ils sortirent et prêchèrent partout, le Seigneur agissant avec eux et confirmant la parole par des signes qui suivaient. Amen.    **\n\nLe Seigneur vous donnera des signes. Il confirmera sa parole dans votre vie. Il entendra et répondra à vos prières pour vous-même et pour les autres. Priez que le Seigneur accompagne votre vie et votre service avec des signes et des prodiges. Apprenez à témoigner et rendre gloire à Jésus. Souvenez-vous de ces neuf lépreux qui ont été guéris ! Aucun d'eux n'a témoigné. Aucun d'eux n'est revenu pour remercier Dieu sauf un, qui était un Samaritain. Je prie pour que vous ne soyez pas comme eux au nom de Jésus !  **\n\n8.6 Le pouvoir de la foi pour guérir.  **\n\nLa Bible nous parle de la puissance de la foi qui est au nom de Jésus pour guérir les malades      **\nActes 3 verset 16  **\n« Et son nom par la foi en son nom a fortifié cet homme, que vous voyez et connaissez, oui, la foi qui est par lui lui a donné cette parfaite santé en présence de vous tous.  **\n\n'...La parfaite santé... ' La parfaite santé sera toujours votre part par Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur si vous croyez selon la parole de Dieu. Vous avez besoin d'une foi solide pour vous permettre de puiser dans la parole de Dieu et de recevoir de la puissance qu'elle contient. Votre foi vous apportera la délivrance.\n\nSi vous êtes un pécheur, vous vous connaissez. Confessez vos péchés et repentez-vous. Alors, donnez votre vie à Jésus. Dites-lui d'entrer dans votre vie. Promettez-lui que vous ne reviendrez plus à votre péché. Dites-lui de prendre le contrôle de votre vie. Croyez qu'il est entré dans votre vie. Si vous le faites, vous serez un enfant de Dieu.

C'est une exposition approfondie de la parole de Dieu sur les faits saillants du mariage comme     **\n(i)\tTête et soumission dans le mariage\n(ii)\tVivre la vie pieuse devant un conjoint impie\n(iii)\tObéissance à la parole de Dieu et sagesse pour une vie sainte dans le mariage  **\nLe livre est rempli de connaissances, de sagesse et de pouvoir pour amener le croyant à vaincre le péché, Satan et la chair qui empêchent de nombreux chrétiens mariés de faire le paradis. Offrez ce livre à beaucoup de gens et faites la promotion de la justice et de la sainteté de Dieu dans l'union conjugale et la vie de famille des disciples de Christ. Le livre montre à l'épouse croyante le genre d'obéissance qu'elle est censée offrir à son mari. Elle doit soumettre sa vie dans l'obéissance à son mari comme l'église vraie et juste le fait à Christ. Sa soumission et son obéissance à son mari doivent être dans la justice. Elle ne doit pas céder à son mari dans ses exigences et ses ordres pécheurs à cause de son honneur envers son Seigneur supérieur et Maître Jésus-Christ. Les maris sont également chargés d'aimer leurs femmes comme Christ aime aussi l'église. Il doit l'aimer avec passion et sacrifice comme le Christ l'a fait pour l'Église.  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 22 à 27  **\n22. Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme au Seigneur.\n23. Car le mari est le chef de la femme, comme Christ est le chef de l'Église et il est le sauveur du corps.\n24. C'est pourquoi, comme l'Église est soumise à Christ, ainsi les femmes le sont en toutes choses à leurs maris.\n25. Maris, aimez vos femmes, comme le Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle.\n26. Afin qu'il la sanctifie et la purifie par le lavage d'eau par la parole.\n27. Afin qu'il puisse se la présenter comme une église glorieuse, sans tache, ni ride, ni rien de semblable ; mais qu'il soit saint et sans défaut.  **\nLe livre est plein de nouvelles idées et de paroles de sagesse qui ravissent le lecteur et vous persuadent, obligent à obéir à la parole de Dieu et à vivre saintement dans le mariage.  **\n \nCHAPITRE 1  **\nCHEF DE FILE DANS LA FAMILLE  **\nPar chef, j'entends celui qui dirige et supervise la maison, le pasteur de la maison et le commandant en chef. C'est l'homme ou le mari. Dieu lui a donné la direction par la création, dans le mariage chrétien et le foyer.  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 3 à 5  **\n3Mais je voudrais que vous sachiez que le chef de tout homme, c'est Christ; et le chef de la femme est l'homme; et le chef de Christ est Dieu.\n4 Tout homme qui prie ou prophétise, la tête couverte, déshonore sa tête.\n5 Mais toute femme qui prie ou prophétise la tête découverte déshonore sa tête, car c'est même une seule comme si elle était rasée.  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 3  **\nMentionne trois chefs ; Dieu comme chef au-dessus de Christ, Christ comme chef au-dessus de l'homme, et l'homme comme chef au-dessus de la femme.  **\n1.1.\tDIEU, LE TÊTE DE LA TRINITÉ  **\nLe Père est le chef de la Trinité   Le Père, le Fils Jésus et le Saint-Esprit. Bien qu'ils soient un et égaux, nous voyons ici dans le dessein de rédemption que le Père est le chef de Christ. Quand Jésus est venu au monde, Il a clairement montré que le Père était Son chef. Le Père était l'autorité qui L'avait envoyé. Il l'a montré très clairement. Le chef de la Divinité, bien qu'une seule personne, est le père.\nLa direction nous a été révélée par la rédemption. Quelqu'un doit être le leader qui commande les actions. D'autres sont les disciples, bien que nous sachions que le Père, le Fils et le Saint-Esprit sont une seule Personne.     **\n Jean 14 verset 28  **\n28Vous avez entendu comment je vous ai dit   Je m'en vais et je reviens vers vous. Si vous m'aimiez, vous vous réjouiriez parce que j'ai dit   Je vais au Père, car mon Père est plus grand que moi.\nMon Père est plus grand que moi parce qu'il m'a envoyé dans le monde en vue de la rédemption. J'ai mis de côté mon égalité avec Lui. Je suis ici pour faire sa volonté.  **\nPhilippiens 2 verset 5 à 9  **\n5 Que cette pensée soit en vous, qui était aussi en Jésus-Christ ; 6Qui, étant sous la forme de Dieu, n'a pas pensé que ce n'était pas un vol d'être égal à Dieu; 7Mais s'est fait sans réputation, et a pris sur lui la forme d'un serviteur, et a été fait à la ressemblance des hommes; 8 Et étant trouvé à la mode en tant qu'homme, il s'est humilié et est devenu obéissant jusqu'à la mort, même la mort de la croix. 9 C'est pourquoi Dieu aussi l'a souverainement élevé et lui a donné un nom qui est au-dessus de tout nom  **\nJésus a mis de côté le rang de Dieu qu'il avait auprès du Père depuis le début, a pris la forme d'un serviteur et est devenu obéissant.  **\n1.2.\tLA SOUMISSION DE JESUS AU PERE  **\nQuelque chose doit être mis de côté pour atteindre le résultat désiré   et c'était la forme de Dieu. L'autorité que Jésus avait en tant que Dieu, Il l'a mise de côté. Pourquoi? Il était devenu un homme et était devenu un serviteur. Il était soumis au Père et lui est devenu obéissant et soumis. Vous pouvez voir cette soumission à partir de Sa parole.  **\nJean 15 verset 9 à 10  **\n9. Comme le Père m'a aimé, je vous ai aimés ; continuez dans Mon amour. 10. Si vous gardez Mes commandements, vous demeurerez dans Mon amour ; de même que j'ai gardé les commandements de mon Père et que je demeure dans son amour.  **\nIl y a une raison pour laquelle le Père M'aime ! Il m'aime parce que je garde ses commandements. Il est Ma tête ; Il est Mon chef ; Il est Mon Superviseur ; Il est Mon Capitaine ; Il est mon directeur. Je reçois des soins affectueux du Père parce que je garde ses commandements.    **\nJean 15 verset 14 à 16  **\nVous êtes mes amis, si vous faites tout ce que je vous commande. Désormais je ne vous appelle plus serviteurs ; car le serviteur ne sait pas ce que fait son Seigneur; mais je vous ai appelés amis; car tout ce que j'ai entendu de mon Père, je vous l'ai fait connaître.  **\nN'est-il pas Dieu pour avoir parlé de lui-même ? Au lieu de cela, dit-il, j'ai entendu parler de mon Père, j'écoute mon Père, je reçois de mon Père, je fais tout ce que vous me voyez faire par mon Père. Pouvez-vous voir la soumission à l'autorité? Il a mis de côté la forme de Dieu en Lui. Maintenant qu'il s'est abaissé à la forme d'un homme, il a montré la soumission et l'obéissance au Père dans l'action, la vie et le caractère.  **\nJean 5 verset 37 à 44  **\n37. Et le Père lui-même, qui m'a envoyé, a rendu témoignage de moi. Vous n'avez jamais entendu sa voix, ni vu sa forme.\n38. Et vous n'avez pas sa parole demeurant en vous, pour qui il a envoyé, vous ne croyez pas en lui.\n39. Sondez les Écritures ; car en eux vous pensez avoir la vie éternelle et ce sont eux qui rendent témoignage de moi.\n40. Et vous ne venez pas à moi pour avoir la vie. 41 Je ne reçois pas l'honneur des hommes.\n42. Mais je vous connais, que vous n'avez pas l'amour de Dieu en vous. 43 Je suis venu au nom de mon Père, et vous ne me recevez pas, si un autre vient en son propre nom, vous le recevrez.\n44. Comment pouvez-vous croire, vous qui recevez l'honneur les uns des autres, et ne cherchez pas l'honneur qui vient de Dieu seul ?  **\nIl rendit témoignage, disant   le Père m'a envoyé. Plus il envoie, moins il y en a. Vous n'avez pas Sa Parole en vous; parce qu'il m'a envoyé, mais vous ne me recevez pas. Il m'a autorisé, mais vous n'acceptez pas mon autorité. Je suis venu au nom de mon Père, sous l'autorité de mon Père. C'est pourquoi les premiers croyants ont été baptisés au nom de Jésus   l'autorité de Jésus, selon Matthieu 28 verset 19.  **\nJésus dit qu'il est venu au nom de son Père, c'est-à-dire que le Père m'a envoyé. Je fais tout cela dans Son autorité, en Lui obéissant. Je ne fais rien en mon nom. Les disciples ne baptisaient pas les gens en leur nom mais au nom de Jésus, qui les autorisait à prêcher parce qu'il leur en avait donné l'autorité.   **\nMatthieu 28 verset 19  **\nAllez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit  **\nLeur baptême n'était pas en leur nom ou leur autorité, mais au nom de Jésus   par l'autorité de Jésus. Jésus a dit, je suis venu au nom de mon Père, mais vous me rejetez. Je ne cherche pas mon honneur mais celui de mon Père.  **\n1.3.\tLES FEMMES DOIVENT SOUMETTRE A LEUR MARI  **\nJésus parle ici de la façon dont il se comporte envers le chef au-dessus de lui pendant qu'il est sur terre. La femme doit illustrer le langage de soumission de Jésus. Ce caractère doit être reflété parce que Jésus est sous l'autorité du Père, comme la femme est aussi sous l'autorité de l'homme.  **\nJésus dit   « J'ai le Père pour chef et je me soumets à lui. Depuis que je suis devenu un homme et un serviteur de Dieu, je suis inférieur à mon Père, qui est toujours sur le trône en tant que Dieu. Je lui obéis et je le sers.'' C'est le caractère pieux d'une personne sous autorité. Vous devriez rechercher la gloire de votre tête et écouter votre tête. Ne faites pas les choses sous votre autorité. Vous ne faites pas les choses en votre pouvoir parce qu'il y a une tête au-dessus de vous. Consultez toujours votre tête.  **\nLe mari est le chef de la femme. En honneur et soumission envers lui, que la femme démontre ouvertement sa loyauté devant l'église, les voisins et la famille.  **\nJean 14 verset 7 à 11  **\n7 Si vous m'aviez connu, vous auriez aussi connu mon Père, et désormais vous le connaissez et vous l'avez vu.\n8 Philippe lui dit   Seigneur, montre-nous le Père, et cela nous suffit.\n9 Jésus lui dit   Il y a si longtemps que je suis avec vous, et tu ne me connais pas, Philippe ? Celui qui m'a vu a vu le Père; et comment dis-tu donc   Montre-nous le Père ?\n10 Ne crois-tu pas que je suis dans le Père, et que le Père est en moi ? Les paroles que je vous dis, je ne parle pas de moi mais du Père qui habite en moi, il fait les oeuvres.\n11 Croyez-moi que je suis dans le Père, et le Père en moi, ou bien croyez-moi à cause des œuvres mêmes.  **\nIci, Jésus parle d'égalité et d'unité avec le Père. Il a ajouté   « Je suis inférieur au Père parce que je suis devenu homme ; sinon, il n'y a pas de différence entre le Père et Moi. Le Père et moi sommes un. Je suis une réplique du Père à tous points de vue. Par sa vie, ses paroles et ses actions, Jésus a clairement montré que le Père est le chef ou le chef de la trinité en ce qui concerne la rédemption humaine.  **\nPremier Jean 5 verset 7  **\nCar il y en a trois qui rendent témoignage dans les cieux, le Père, la Parole et le Saint-Esprit, et ces trois sont un.  **\n Jean 14 verset 28  **\nVous avez entendu comment je vous ai dit   Je m'en vais et je reviens vers vous. Si vous m'aimiez, vous vous réjouiriez parce que j'ai dit   Je vais au Père, car mon Père est plus grand que moi.  **\n1.4.\tLE CHEF DE CHRIST SUR L'HOMME/MARI  **\nNous voyons aussi la direction de Christ sur l'homme.  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 3  **\n3 Mais je voudrais que vous sachiez que le chef de tout homme, c'est Christ ; et le chef de la femme, c'est l'homme, et le chef de Christ, c'est Dieu.  **\nL'homme devrait-il se comporter envers Christ de la même manière que Christ se comporte envers le Père ? Oui, c'est ce que cela signifie. Comme le Christ l'a fait au Père, en disant   « Je ne suis pas ici pour montrer ma gloire, mes prouesses, ma puissance, ma sagesse ; Je suis ici comme un homme envoyé », c'est ainsi que l'homme devrait faire dans le mariage et la famille. Vous ne devez pas montrer à la famille que vous êtes quelqu'un dont tous doivent trembler ou craindre servilement. Vous devriez dire   « Je suis ici comme quelqu'un que le Seigneur a reconnu et qui m'a donné la position de chef.  **\n1.5.\tLE MARI OU LE PÈRE NE DOIT PAS ÊTRE REDOUTÉ OU ADORÉ  **\nL'homme ne doit pas être adoré à la maison. L'homme ne doit pas traiter les membres de la famille, la femme, les enfants et les occupants de la maison comme s'ils étaient ses captifs ou ses esclaves. L'homme doit veiller à maintenir la douceur dans la famille afin que sa femme ne devienne pas une esclave tremblante devant lui. Ses enfants ne doivent pas devenir esclaves, tremblant au son de sa voix.   **\nHomme, Christ est ta tête. Pourquoi votre famille devrait-elle s'incliner et vous adorer ? Non pas qu'ils ne doivent pas s'incliner par respect   il y a une différence entre s'incliner par respect et s'incliner par adoration. Leur respect pour vous devrait être dans l'amour et non par la menace. Pierre a refusé d'être adoré parce qu'il était un homme. Vous aussi, vous devez y résister. Pourquoi votre famille vous redoute-t-elle ? Pourquoi votre femme vous redoute-t-elle ? Pourquoi ne peut-elle pas vous parler, vous raconter ou même vous reprocher vos méfaits ? Pourquoi ne l'acceptez-vous pas ? N'es-tu pas un homme ? Es-tu devenu Dieu ? Parce que Dieu t'a établi au-dessus de la femme, tu deviens Dieu ? Non!  **\nActes 10 verset 25 à 29  **\n25 Et comme Pierre entrait, Corneille le rencontra, se prosterna à ses pieds et se prosterna devant lui.\n26 Mais Pierre le fit monter, en disant   Lève-toi ; Moi aussi je suis un homme. 27 Et comme il parlait avec lui, il entra et trouva beaucoup de personnes qui étaient réunies.\n2 8 Et il leur dit   Vous savez qu'il est interdit à un Juif de tenir compagnie ou d'aller chez quelqu'un d'une autre nation ; mais Dieu m'a montré que je ne dois appeler aucun homme souillé ou impur.\n29 C'est pourquoi je suis venu vers vous sans contredire, dès que j'ai été envoyé chercher, je vous demande donc dans quel but vous m'avez envoyé chercher ?  **\nPierre a dit   « Je suis un homme comme toi. Dieu m'a dit de ne pas t'appeler infidèle, impur ou inférieur. De même, Dieu te dit, mari, ne traite pas ta femme selon les coutumes des hommes. Ne traitez pas votre femme selon les traditions de votre tribu, de votre race ou de votre culture, et n'imitez pas les hommes naturels en traitant votre femme comme ils le font. Elle mérite le respect et l'honneur, bien que sous votre direction. Soumettez-vous entièrement à Christ qui est votre tête. Suivez sa parole dans votre relation avec votre femme.  **\nDès que tu m'as envoyé chercher, dit Pierre, je suis venu parce que le Seigneur m'a demandé d'y aller. C'est pourquoi je suis venu; sinon, je ne serais pas venu. Je ne fais rien par moi-même. Je fais seulement ce que je vois du Seigneur, ce que j'entends du Seigneur. Tout ce que je fais ne relève pas de mon autorité. Je dois demander au Seigneur. Je le fais par le Seigneur. Que le mari s'abandonne donc pleinement à Christ dans la famille. Le Christ est votre chef   le chef de la famille. Certaines familles ont un portrait qui dit, le Christ est le chef de cette maison, l'auditeur silencieux de toute conversation. Alors rappelez-vous toujours que Jésus est votre tête et ne sera pas satisfait de vous si vous faites des actions qui ne lui apportent pas la gloire. Si vous faites des demandes qu'il ne veut pas, il ne sera pas content de vous.    **\nLes enfants d'Israël se sont plaints de Salomon après sa mort qu'il avait rendu leur service douloureux. Salomon a rétrogradé, recherchant la beauté et la gloire humaine et accablant les gens. Il ne cherchait plus à Dieu pour guider ses voies. Il suivait plutôt les désirs de son cœur. Mais le peuple en a souffert. De même, lorsque le mari régresse, la femme et les membres de la famille souffrent   la femme et les enfants souffrent parce qu'il n'est plus lié à Dieu et ne reçoit pas d'instruction de Lui. Maris, recevez vos instructions de Dieu. Ce que vous apportez à la famille devrait être ce que Jésus permet. Les règles que vous introduisez dans la famille doivent être conformes aux instructions de la Parole de Dieu. Cela montrera clairement à votre famille et aux autres que vous êtes sous la direction de Christ, et alors votre mariage résistera aux défis de la vie si vous obéissez et vous soumettez à Christ et les gouvernez par la Parole de Dieu.  **\nLuc 6 verset 46 à 49  **\n46 Et pourquoi m'appelez-vous Seigneur, Seigneur, et ne faites-vous pas ce que je dis ?\n47 Quiconque vient à moi, et entend mes paroles, et les met en pratique, je vous montrerai à qui il est semblable ;\n48 Il est comme un homme qui bâtit une maison, et qui creusa profondément, et posa les fondations sur un roc, et quand le déluge se leva, le torrent se rua sur cette maison avec véhémence, et ne put l'ébranler, car elle était fondée sur un roc. .\n49 Mais celui qui écoute et ne fait pas, est comme un homme qui, sans fondement, a bâti une maison sur la terre ; contre lequel le courant a battu avec véhémence, et immédiatement il est tombé; et la ruine de cette maison était grande.\n1.6.\tHEADSHIP DU MARI SUR LA FEMME  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 3  **\n3 Mais je voudrais que vous sachiez que le chef de tout homme, c'est Christ ; et le chef de la femme est l'homme; et le chef de Christ est Dieu.\nLa tête de la femme est l'homme. Comme Christ se soumet au Père, l'homme, le mari, doit faire de même pour Christ, et la femme, la femme, pour l'homme (mari). C'est l'ordre. Christ a-t-il déjà désobéi au Père ?     **\nJean 8 verset 29  **\n29Et celui qui m'a envoye est avec moi, le Pere ne m'a pas laisse seul; car je fais toujours les choses qui lui plaisent.  **\nJésus a dit, mon Père m'aime aussi parce que je fais toujours les choses qui lui plaisent. Si vous voulez profiter du mariage, femme, faites toujours les choses qui plaisent à votre mari. Encore une fois, écoutez Jésus parler   « Mon Père m'aime parce que je garde ses commandements.  **\n Jean 15 verset 10  **\n10 Si vous gardez mes commandements, vous demeurerez dans mon amour; de même que j'ai gardé les commandements de mon Père et que je demeure dans son amour.  **\nPar conséquent, une femme doit garder les commandements ou les instructions de son mari pour provoquer son amour pour elle-même. La désobéissance à son mari le pousse à se mettre en colère contre elle. Cela entrave la libre circulation de l'amour envers elle. Je ne cherche pas ma gloire mais la gloire de Celui qui m'a envoyé   Jésus-Christ a dit.  **\nJean 8 verset 50  **\n50 Et je ne cherche pas ma propre gloire, il y en a un qui cherche et qui juge.  **\nCherchez la gloire de votre mari. Ne cherchez pas votre reconnaissance ; cherchez la reconnaissance de votre mari.\nNe vous magnifiez pas dans la famille ; au lieu de cela, magnifiez votre mari. Cela lui fera savoir que vous vous soumettez à sa direction.  **\nProverbes 31 verset 23  **\nSon mari est connu aux portes, lorsqu'il est assis parmi les anciens du pays.  **\nDe cette façon, votre mari vous aimera et vous promouvra à la maison et devant les hommes.  **\n Proverbes 31 verset 28 à 29  **\n28Ses enfants se lèvent et la disent bienheureuse; son mari aussi, et il la loue. 29Beaucoup de filles ont agi avec vertu, mais tu les surpasses toutes.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 2  **\nDÉSOBÉISSANCE À LA TÊTE  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 4  **\n4 Tout homme qui prie ou prophétise, la tête couverte, déshonore sa tête.  **\nCette Écriture nous dit qu'il peut y avoir désobéissance à la direction. L'homme peut déshonorer sa tête, qui est Dieu ou Christ, tandis que la femme peut déshonorer sa tête, c'est-à-dire le mari. Christ n'a jamais déshonoré Son chef, Dieu le Père.  **\n2.1. DESHONNEUR A CHRIST PAR LE MARI  **\nQui est le chef du mari? Christ est sa tête. Mais cela peut arriver dans un mariage où le mari déshonore Christ.\nDe nombreux témoignages et récits de désobéissance à Christ par les hommes abondent. Ici, c'est au sens physique. Si l'homme est dans l'église pour le culte et couvre sa tête avec une casquette, un chapeau ou un tissu, il dit qu'il n'est pas sous Christ ; il ne se soumet pas à Christ. Cela signifie qu'il a couvert Jésus, sa tête, et prive Jésus d'être vu et honoré par les hommes dans sa vie. Finalement, il dit   « Je couvre la présence de Christ, je couvre la gloire de Christ, je couvre l'autorité de Christ en ce lieu, je reste seul. C'est ce que cela implique lorsqu'un homme se couvre la tête dans l'église ou pendant la prière. C'est la même chose que lorsque certaines personnes entrent dans votre chambre et que vous prenez un morceau de tissu et couvrez quelque chose pour qu'elles ne voient pas. C'est précisément ce qu'un homme fait au Christ lorsqu'il met une casquette, un chapeau ou une couverture sur sa tête pendant la prière ou le culte à l'église.  **\nAu sens spirituel, beaucoup d'hommes déshonorent Christ lorsqu'ils rejettent le contrôle de Christ dans leur famille. Lorsque votre désir ou votre autorité remplace celle de Christ dans le foyer, vous avez déshonoré Christ. Lorsque ce que vous demandez à votre femme ou à vos enfants de faire pour vous est contraire à ce que Christ enseigne dans les Écritures, vous méprisez Christ. Lorsque vous demandez à votre femme ou à vos enfants d'aller au-delà de la justice vers le royaume du mal, vous avez couvert Christ. Vous dites maintenant   « Je suis le seul responsable dans ma famille. Je rejette la direction de Jésus-Christ sur moi. \nLorsque vous demandez aux enfants de faire quelque chose de mal que Christ ne permettra pas, vous dites   « Vous n'êtes pas sous Christ ; vous rejetez Sa direction. Christ n'a jamais désobéi à Son Père; Il n'a jamais parlé ou n'a fait aucune action qui apporterait du mépris au Père. Il ne nous a jamais appris à désobéir au Père.  **\nLuc 18 verset 18, 19  **\n18. Et un chef l'interrogea, disant   Bon Maître, que ferai-je pour hériter la vie éternelle ? 19. Et Jésus lui dit   Pourquoi m'appelles-tu bon ? Nul n'est bon, sauf un, c'est-à-dire Dieu.  **\nRendez honneur au Père; le reconnaître. Voyez comment Jésus a rendu honneur au Père ? Pourquoi donc, homme, déshonores-tu le Christ ? Femme, pourquoi déshonorez-vous votre mari ?\nLorsque vous refusez à votre mari l'honneur que vous devriez lui accorder, vous perturbez la présence ou l'impact de Dieu dans votre famille. Lorsque vous vous battez, que vous vous disputez, que vous criez, que vous faites preuve de charnalité, que vous vous vantez et que vous maudissez votre mari, vous le déshonorez et, selon les Écritures, vous avez déshonoré Christ. C'est un rejet direct de la présence de la justice dans votre mariage et votre famille.\nVous êtes-vous déjà demandé comment cela se serait passé si Christ avait désobéi à son Père ? Comment cela aurait-il été si Christ n'avait jamais fait ce qui plaisait au Père ? Dieu n'aurait évidemment pas été satisfait de Lui. Pourquoi ne respectez-vous pas Christ dans votre mariage et votre foyer ? Pourquoi exiger des choses que vous savez que Christ ne soutiendrait pas ou n'approuverait pas ?  **\nComment pouvez-vous exiger une sorte d'obéissance que vous savez que Jésus n'aimerait pas ?\nLorsque vous demandez à votre femme d'avoir des relations sexuelles orales (d'utiliser sa bouche, ses lèvres ou sa langue pour stimuler votre partie intime ou votre anus), n'est-ce pas une désobéissance à l'autorité et à la justice de Christ ? Pourquoi lui reprochez-vous de vous avoir refusé une telle obéissance ? Ne doit-elle pas être soumise au Christ, votre chef ?  **                                                                 \nLorsque vous accomplissez avec votre femme des actes que vous ne devriez pas dans la sainteté de Christ, dans la pureté de Christ et prononcez des paroles que vous ne devriez pas prononcer, n'êtes-vous pas en train de déshonorer Christ ? En effet, Il ne vous acceptera pas ; Il se détournera de vous et ne vous regardera pas. Maintenant que vous avez déshonoré Christ, qu'attendez-vous qu'il se passe ? Les épouses chrétiennes ne doivent pas se soumettre à leurs maris lorsqu'ils exigent l'obéissance, ce qui les conduit à pécher contre Dieu, le Suprême.   **\n2.2. DESHONNEUR AU MARI PAR LA FEMME  **\nLes femmes déshonorent aussi leur chef, le mari.  **\n 1 Corinthiens 4 verset 5  **\nNe jugez donc rien avant le temps, jusqu'à ce que le Seigneur vienne, qui à la fois mettra en lumière les choses cachées des ténèbres, et rendra manifestes les conseils des cœurs, et alors chacun recevra la louange de Dieu.\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 5  **\n5 Mais toute femme qui prie ou prophétise la tête découverte a déshonoré sa tête, car c'est même une seule comme si elle était rasée.  **\nToute femme qui prie la tête découverte déshonore sa tête. Qu'est-ce que cela signifie? Vous déshonorez l'homme, votre tête, ce qui ne devrait pas être fait. L'homme est honoré devant Dieu lorsque la femme couvre son chef en couvrant sa tête en présence de Dieu. Laisser votre tête découverte dans l'adoration et la prière signifie que vous voulez dire à Dieu que l'homme est égal à Lui dans la gloire et la direction. C'est une offense à Dieu. Vous êtes censé couvrir la direction et la gloire de l'homme lorsque vous venez devant Dieu. Cela se fait en vous couvrant la tête avec un serre-tête.  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 7  **\n7En effet, l'homme ne doit pas se couvrir la tête, puisqu'il est l'image et la gloire de Dieu, mais la femme est la gloire de l'homme.  **\nEn présence de Dieu, couvrez la gloire de l'homme. Si vous n'êtes pas prêt à le faire, vous déshonorez l'homme en désobéissant à l'ordre établi par le Seigneur, son chef. Vous entendrez même certaines femmes demander   « Pourquoi dois-je me couvrir la tête alors que l'homme ne couvre pas la sienne ? L'homme ne couvre pas sa tête parce que le Seigneur lui a dit de la laisser découverte. Sa tête ouverte est un moyen physique de montrer la présence de Jésus et son autorité sur de telles activités spirituelles. Puisque l'homme ne peut pas contrôler de tels moments, sa présence et son autorité doivent être couvertes. Cela se fait en couvrant la tête de la femme avec un serre-tête. Refuser de le faire montre que vous n'êtes soumis ni à l'homme ni à Dieu dans votre vie chrétienne. Ce problème s'étend à certains foyers, où la femme rivalise avec l'homme. \"Vous laissez votre tête découverte, alors je laisserai également la mienne découverte. C'est de la concurrence, c'est de l'irrespect. Vous ne voulez pas reconnaître que l'homme est plus grand que vous et a été fait votre tête par Dieu Lui-même ?   **\nJésus a ouvertement reconnu la grandeur de son Père sur lui, en disant   « Mon Père est plus grand que moi.  **\nJean 14 verset 28  **\n28Vous avez entendu comment je vous ai dit   Je m'en vais et je reviens vers vous. Si vous m'aimiez, vous vous réjouiriez parce que j'ai dit   Je vais au Père, car mon Père est plus grand que moi.  **\nL'homme ne devrait jamais prendre la gloire de Dieu. Qu'il apprenne de Christ et de Pierre aussi, comme on le voit dans l'Écriture ci-dessous  \nActes 10 verset 25 à 26  **\n25 Et comme Pierre entrait, Corneille vint à sa rencontre, se jeta à ses pieds et se prosterna devant lui.\n26Mais Pierre le fit monter, disant  Lève-toi; Moi aussi je suis un homme.  **\nLa femme doit comprendre qu'elle est la gloire de l'homme et cesser d'essayer de rivaliser avec lui. Dieu a donné à l'homme un privilège au-dessus d'elle. Quand la femme refuse et dit   « Non ! Pourquoi doit-il être au-dessus de moi ? Lorsque vous défiez l'homme que Dieu a autorisé, vous défiez aussi Jésus et le Père. C'est une loi spirituelle.  **\nMatthieu 10 verset 40  **\n40Celui qui vous reçoit me reçoit, et celui qui me reçoit reçoit celui qui m'a envoyé. Si vous obéissez à votre mari, c'est à Dieu que vous obéissez.  **\nSi vous vous soumettez à votre mari, c'est à Christ que vous êtes soumise. Pouvez-vous voir la chaîne? Celui qui vous méprise me méprise; il méprise aussi le Père qui m'a envoyé. Maintenant que vous êtes têtue envers l'homme et que vous ne vous soumettez pas mais luttez avec égalité, refusant d'honorer votre mari, vous déshonorez le Christ et le Père   Le Dieu qui vous a créée. Lorsque vous avez des problèmes pour vous soumettre à votre mari, qui est votre chef, lui répondant quand il parle, pensant que vous avez la même autorité, vous ne suivez pas l'ordre de Dieu. Dieu dit que l'homme est le chef de la femme. Obéissez à Dieu et soumettez-vous à Lui dans tous les domaines de la justice et de la sainteté. C'est la volonté de Dieu pour toi, femme.\nQuand une femme refuse de se soumettre à son mari, elle refuse de se soumettre à Christ. Lorsque vous répondez à l'homme, c'est à Christ que vous répondez. Vous vous rebellez contre Jésus lorsque vous refusez d'obéir à une instruction divine de votre mari. Ne pensez pas que vous vous rebellez uniquement contre votre mari. Si vous ne pouvez pas obéir à votre mari, que vous voyez de vos propres yeux, comment pouvez-vous obéir à Jésus, que vous ne voyez pas ? Lorsque vous obéissez à votre mari, vous obéissez à Christ. A qui obéissez-vous lorsque vous vous couvrez la tête ? Soyez peu à vos propres yeux et obéissez à votre mari qui est aussi sous Christ.   **\nEphésiens 5 verset 22 à 24  **\n22 Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme au Seigneur.\n23Car le mari est le chef de la femme, comme Christ est le chef de l'Eglise et il est le Sauveur du corps.\n24C'est pourquoi, comme l'Eglise est soumise au Christ, ainsi les femmes le sont en toutes choses pour leurs maris.  **\nPouvez-vous voir la position que Dieu place votre mari dans le mariage et le foyer ? Comment alors dites-vous   « Je vais au ciel, que cela plaise ou non à Satan », et péchez-vous contre votre mari ? Qui te donnera le paradis ? Vous n'êtes pas qualifié pour le paradis ! Jésus est Celui qui place votre mari dans sa position au-dessus de vous dans le mariage et la famille. Sa Parole dit que vous devez vous soumettre à votre mari comme au Seigneur. Votre mari est la représentation physique de Jésus. Il est facile d'examiner si vous allez au ciel ou non parce que vous avez une image physique ou une personne dans votre mari en tant que représentant de Dieu. Ce que vous lui faites détermine où vous serez. Il détermine où vous passerez l'éternité. Écrivez l'examen et corrigez le papier; vous saurez si vous avez bien écrit ou non puisque vous avez la réponse. Demandez à votre mari si vous le servez bien selon les Écritures pour connaître votre destin éternel. Il en est ainsi si votre mari marche selon les Écritures et exige uniquement votre obéissance aux Écritures. Vous pouvez vous noter. C'est comme faire des exercices dans un manuel, avec les réponses à la fin du livre. Lorsque vous répondez à une question, allez à la fin du livre et vérifiez si vous avez bien répondu. En ce qui concerne votre personnage, allez à la fin du livre et déterminez si vous avez bien répondu. Votre mari est la dernière page du livre 34 qui vous aide à voir si vous avez la bonne réponse, si vous êtes qualifié pour le ciel. C'est aussi simple que cela. Vous pouvez dire que les exigences de l'homme sont trop exigeantes. Jésus pensait autant au Père, mais comment a-t-il répondu ? Il a dit   « Père, cette coupe est terrible pour moi ; c'est lourd pour moi; J'aimerais que tu puisses me l'enlever. Mais ce n'était pas la fin parce qu'il a aussi dit   « Néanmoins, que ma volonté ne soit pas faite, mais que ta volonté soit faite.   **\nLuc 22 verset 42  **\n42 Disant   Père, si tu le veux, éloigne de moi cette coupe, néanmoins, que ma volonté ne soit pas faite, mais la tienne.  **\nMême Jésus a souffert. Il aurait souhaité en tant qu'homme ne pas obéir à certaines exigences que le Père lui demandait, notamment aller à la croix. C'était difficile pour Lui, mais voyez la soumission   ''Pas ma volonté, mais la Tienne, soit faite ! Alors, quelles sont ces choses dont vous accusez votre mari ? Vont-ils vous tuer ? Pouvez-vous les nommer? Rappelez-vous que Jésus a obéi au Père, jusqu'à la mort de la croix ! Il s'est soumis à la volonté du Père. Pratiquez une obéissance coûteuse et gagnez l'amour durable de votre mari.  **\n2.3. QU'EN EST-IL DE LA SOUMISSION DE L'HOMME AU CHRIST  **\nEst-ce facile? Considérez le cas de l'apôtre Pierre, qui, au lieu de se tenir courageusement pour Jésus, lui a tourné le dos avec peur, niant le connaître à trois reprises. Le Seigneur ne l'a pas abandonné. Il a réintégré Pierre après sa résurrection, lui donnant le pouvoir de marcher dans l'obéissance parce qu'il n'y a pas de place pour la rébellion dans notre marche avec Dieu. Ce n'est pas facile. Considérez les souffrances de Paul. Considérez les souffrances des apôtres. Qui d'entre eux s'est retiré ?  **\n Jacques 5 verset 10 à 11  **\n10 Prenez, mes frères, les prophètes qui ont parlé au nom du Seigneur, pour exemple d'affliction et de patience.\n11 Voici, nous comptons heureux ceux qui endurent. Vous avez entendu parler de la patience de Job, et vous avez vu la fin du Seigneur ; que le Seigneur est très miséricordieux et d'une tendre miséricorde.  **\nVous devez être patient avec votre mari. Laissez patiemment votre mari entre les mains de Dieu. Endurez les épreuves entre les mains de votre mari comme Jésus-Christ a enduré les épreuves entre les mains des hommes.  **\n2.4. RAISONS POUR LESQUELLES DE NOMBREUSES FEMMES SOUFFRENT DANS LE MARIAGE  **\nSoumettez-vous à votre mari. Agar, pourquoi es-tu dans le désert ? Je fuis ma maîtresse. Pourquoi? Elle était si dure avec moi. Pourquoi était-elle dure avec toi ? Votre personnage l'a causé. Retournez et soumettez-vous à elle. Vous étiez têtu avec elle; tu l'as méprisée parce que tu es enceinte, et elle ne l'est pas ? Alors, vous l'avez dédaignée ; tu oublies que tu es une bonne? La grossesse peut-elle maintenant vous donner le leadership sur elle ?   **\nGenèse 16 verset 8 à 9  **\n8 Et il dit   Agar, la servante de Saraï, d'où es-tu venue ? Et où iras-tu ? Et elle dit   Je fuis devant ma maîtresse Sarai.\n9Et l'ange de l'Eternel lui dit  Retourne vers ta maitresse, et soumets-toi sous sa main.  **\nFemme, n'avez-vous pas causé ce trouble dans votre vie ? Maintenant, votre mari a des problèmes avec vous. La vie est difficile pour vous car il vous traite d'une main de fer. Vous n'êtes pas responsable ? N'est-ce pas parce que vous le méprisez et le dédaignez ? N'est-ce pas pour cela qu'il vous traite durement ? Sarah a dit à Abraham   ''Mon péché soit sur toi. Pourquoi as-tu accepté quand je t'ai dit que tu devais prendre une autre femme, ma bonne ? Tu savais que c'était à cause de mon impatience que je te pressais d'épouser ma bonne. Pourquoi n'avez-vous pas refusé ? Ne saviez-vous pas que cela entraînerait le mal? Dieu vous a-t-il dit d'épouser quelqu'un d'autre ? N'est-ce pas moi qui te l'ai dit ? Pourquoi avez-vous accepté? Je vous tiens pour responsable du mal qui s'est produit entre cette dame et moi.  **\nCette femme me donne du fil à retordre. Je vais m'occuper d'elle. Elle a vu qu'elle était enceinte et m'a méprisé; elle m'a déclassé. Je vais m'occuper d'elle. Qu'a dit Abraham ? « Voici, ta servante est entre tes mains. N'est-ce pas vous qui m'avez demandé de l'épouser ? Je ne t'ai pas rabaissé à cause d'elle. Vous traitez avec elle d'une manière qui, selon vous, la fera se soumettre à vous. Je ne suis pas la raison de sa fierté envers toi. Quelle grande leçon les hommes et les dirigeants devraient apprendre. Ne soutenez pas les idées de votre femme ou de vos suiveurs, peu importe la pression. Assurez-vous que c'est la volonté de Dieu.  **\nAlors, femme, découvrez pourquoi les choses sont comme elles sont dans votre mariage et votre foyer.  **\n2.5. SOUMETTRE A VOTRE MARI  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 22 à 23  **\n22 Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme au Seigneur.\n23 Car le mari est le chef de la femme, comme Christ est le chef de l'Église, et il est le Sauveur du corps.  **\nChrist est le Sauveur du corps, pas vous ! Lorsque vous faites des déclarations telles que « c'est moi qui achète de la nourriture ; Je suis celui qui paie les factures, achète des vêtements ; c'est moi qui paye les frais de scolarité de mes enfants ; la question est, pourquoi êtes-vous le seul? Comment avez-vous obtenu l'argent? C'est parce que vous avez refusé de soumettre l'argent que vous avez à votre mari pour qu'il fasse ce qui doit être fait. Pourquoi avez-vous gardé l'argent? Es-tu le sauveur de la famille ? N'est-ce pas l'argent que vous avez gagné dans cette maison, dans ce mariage ? N'êtes-vous pas un avec votre mari?  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 31  **\n31C'est pourquoi l'homme quittera son père et sa mère, et s'attachera à sa femme, et les deux deviendront une seule chair.    **\nParce que vous avez gardé l'argent, vous appelez votre nom dessus. Jésus cherchait-il sa gloire ? Pourquoi n'avez-vous pas remis l'argent à votre mari ? Pourquoi ne pas faire toutes ces choses au nom de votre mari ? Pourquoi l'appelez-vous votre argent? Pourquoi ne pas appeler ça l'argent de votre mari ?  **\nJe dis qu'en faisant cela, vous avez refusé de vous couvrir la tête. Par une telle action, vous dites   « La tête de mon mari est nue ; le mien aussi sera nu. je ne le couvrirai pas; Je suis comme lui. C'est là qu'est le problème   l'insubordination. Apprenez la soumission, et vous trouverez la paix et la vie éternelle. Si vous faites cela, votre mari rétrograde viendra ; Il reviendra.  **\nLorsque Naomi apprit que le Seigneur avait visité Israël, elle retourna à Bethléhem. Soumettez-vous, et le Seigneur vous visitera. Vous verrez des changements dans votre foyer ; vous verrez des changements chez votre mari. Il reviendra vers vous pour vous aimer et prendre soin de vous.  **\n\nCHAPITRE 3  **\nCHEF DE CHRIST SUR LA FAMILLE  **\n3.1. OBÉISSANCE ET SOUMISSION EN FAMILLE  **\nLes deux parents ont la direction des enfants. La famille chrétienne doit reconnaître la direction de Christ et se soumettre volontairement à lui, et lui obéir pleinement dans toute sujétion. Le ménage doit reconnaître Jésus et se soumettre à lui.  **\nMatthieu 22 verset 37 à 39  **\n37 Jésus lui dit   Tu aimeras le Seigneur, ton Dieu, de tout ton cœur, de toute ton âme, et de toute ta pensée. 38C'est le premier et le plus grand commandement.\n39Et le second lui est semblable  Tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi-meme.  **\nLa première chose à laquelle une famille chrétienne doit se consacrer est d'aimer le Seigneur Dieu de tout son cœur. Dieu doit venir en premier et non le mari, la femme ou les enfants. Tu aimeras le Seigneur ton Dieu est le premier commandement. Donc, tout d'abord. Femme, c'est le Seigneur ton Dieu d'abord, pas ton mari. Vous devriez l'aimer, mais Dieu d'abord. L'homme doit aimer sa femme mais secondairement à Christ. Les enfants doivent aimer leurs parents, mais leur premier amour doit être pour Christ. Le premier amour de chacun dans la famille devrait être envers le Seigneur Dieu. Les parents doivent chérir leurs enfants, ce qui est le deuxième commandement et doit venir après le premier commandement.  **\nLe premier est le Seigneur votre Dieu. Si la famille a Jésus pour chef, elle doit l'aimer de tout son cœur, son âme, sa puissance et sa force.  **\nLe premier devoir du mari dans la famille est de diriger l'amour de la femme et des enfants vers Dieu. Pas à lui-même mais à Dieu d'abord. Pas votre volonté, mais la volonté de Dieu ; parce qu'il est votre chef. Jésus est votre tête; Jésus est votre Dieu. Que votre premier amour soit dirigé vers Lui. N'empêche pas ta femme d'aimer le Seigneur. Donnez-lui le temps d'adorer Dieu. C'est l'une des façons dont vous montrerez votre amour pour le Seigneur. Donnez-lui le temps de prier et d'étudier les Écritures et de connaître son Dieu. C'est une expression de votre amour pour Dieu. Donnez-lui du temps pour fraterniser et assister à des conférences dans son amour sincère pour Dieu.  **\nDonnez à votre femme et à vos enfants de l'argent pour le transport ou transportez-les vous-même aux réunions chrétiennes. Dieu doit venir en premier en tout, et nos actions doivent refléter cela. Quand vos enfants ne sont pas sérieux dans la maison de Dieu mais sont sérieux à l'école ; lorsque vous dépensez beaucoup d'argent pour les envoyer à l'école mais que vous les laissez à la maison au moment de la communion fraternelle, cela reflète à quel point vos priorités sont mal placées. Tout d'abord   Aimez Dieu, dirigez-les vers l'amour de Dieu.  **\nFemme, tu dois faire passer Dieu avant ton mari. Adam, pourquoi pas Dieu d'abord ? Pourquoi mettre votre femme à la première place devant Dieu ?  **\nAdam, Dieu a dit que tu ne devrais pas manger ce fruit, mais tu as obéi à ta femme pour désobéir à Dieu et tu en as mangé. Dieu d'abord! N'écoutez pas votre femme si cela contredit la Parole de Dieu. Ne vous occupez pas de ses pleurs; sinon, elle mettra son blâme sur vous comme Sarah l'a fait. Abraham a demandé   « N'est-ce pas toi qui m'as conseillé ? Sarah a répondu, alors que vous saviez que mon conseil était mauvais, pourquoi l'avez-vous suivi ? Pourquoi l'avez-vous accepté alors que vous saviez que mon conseil vous éloignerait de la volonté de Dieu ? « Mais vous pleuriez. « Si je pleure, est-ce que je ne me fatiguerai pas ? Ai-je pleuré dans votre maison pendant 24 heures ? Ignorez mon cri; faites ce que Dieu vous dit. Maintenant que vous ne l'avez pas fait, c'est devenu un problème à la maison. Dieu d'abord, pas ta femme. Ne faites pas attention à ce qu'elle pleure   « Je vais quitter cette maison ; tu ne m'aimes pas…\"    **\nDieu d'abord   Dieu la ramènera si elle s'en va parce que Dieu serait de votre côté. Aimez Dieu d'abord, puis votre femme. L'amour n'est pas divisé. La façon dont vous aimez Dieu se répercutera naturellement sur votre femme. Si vous aimez Dieu en premier, cela rejaillira sur votre femme. De même, si vous, femme, aimez Dieu en premier, cela reviendra à votre mari. L'amour pour votre conjoint sera pur parce que l'amour de Dieu est pur. De même, il coulerait frais et pur pour les enfants.  **\nAimez Dieu d'abord, puis vous pourrez aller de l'avant et aimer votre femme et vos enfants, ce qui est le deuxième commandement.  **\nMatthieu 22 verset 39  **\n39Et le second lui est semblable  Tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi-meme.  **\nEn tant qu'épouse, vous pouvez aimer votre mari après avoir fait le premier devoir   aimer le Seigneur. Lorsque vous êtes connecté à Lui, l'amour coulera. Dieu est debout; l'homme est à terre. Jetez l'amour vers Dieu, et il tombera sur l'homme. Le Seigneur permettra que cela tombe sur votre mari et vos enfants alors que vous lui lancez de l'amour.  **\nDieu d'abord! L'homme ne doit pas lutter avec Jésus pour la direction. Puisque Jésus donne volontairement sa direction sur le mariage et la famille, l'homme ne doit pas rivaliser avec lui pour la direction.  **\nHomme, ne lutte pas pour la direction de Jésus. Laissez la tête ouverte   découverte. Jésus est la tête. Ne luttez pas avec Jésus pour la gloire dans votre foyer. Vous êtes la gloire de Jésus. Ce n'est pas la volonté du mari mais celle de Jésus qui doit être faite dans cette maison. Comme le Seigneur a dit au Père   « Non pas ma volonté mais la tienne », toi aussi tu dois dire à Jésus   « Non pas ma volonté mais la tienne », et ta femme doit te dire la même chose. C'est la direction et la soumission dans le mariage pour votre paix, votre joie et votre bénédiction. Par conséquent, tous les membres de la famille doivent d'abord obéir au Seigneur Jésus, le rémunérateur de leur âme. Qu'avez-vous pour votre femme, homme, qui ne mourra pas lorsque la fleur disparaîtra dans la chaleur brûlante du lever du soleil ? Quelle récompense avez-vous ? Votre récompense peut-elle couvrir son âme, que vous vouliez l'éloigner de Jésus, son Seigneur, son Dieu, le rémunérateur ? Puisque vous voulez détourner ses yeux de Jésus, pouvez-vous lui donner la vie éternelle ? Vous voulez la retirer du culte de Jésus; pouvez-vous donner la vie éternelle à votre femme? Pouvez-vous même lui donner la tranquillité d'esprit, pouvez-vous guérir son corps et pouvez-vous la protéger de Satan ? Par conséquent, permettez à votre femme de se soumettre à la volonté de Jésus, pas à la vôtre. Jésus est le rémunérateur de son âme; Il est le rémunérateur de ceux qui le cherchent avec diligence. Permettez à votre femme de le chercher afin qu'elle puisse recevoir des récompenses, à la fois terrestres et éternelles.   **\n3.2. PERMETTRE A VOTRE FEMME DE SE SOUMETTRE AU COURS DE DIEU  **\nPermettez à votre femme de payer la dîme ; c'est à son Dieu et Maître. Aussi, permettez-lui de soutenir des projets concernant le nom de Jésus, bien que vous deviez vérifier qu'elle ne contribue pas au détriment du bien-être de votre famille. Ne l'empêchez pas d'être gentille. Ne l'empêchez pas d'être charitable. Ne la menacez pas au point qu'elle vous cache ses actions caritatives, et cela deviendrait un péché pour elle. Laissez votre femme avoir la liberté en Christ de servir Dieu et de pratiquer la justice. C'est ce que le Seigneur exige d'un vrai mari chrétien.  **\nLa femme et les enfants ne doivent pas hésiter à donner la priorité à l'obéissance à Jésus, qui est plus grand que l'homme à la maison. Ils doivent être prêts à refuser à l'homme la soumission et l'obéissance s'il contredit Jésus. Oui, le Seigneur a fait de lui le chef, mais il ne doit pas essayer de conduire sa famille contre Dieu, qui lui a donné l'autorité. Quelle est donc votre sécurité si vous obéissez maintenant à quelqu'un qui doit mourir ? Après sa mort, où irez-vous ? Avec qui vous laissera-t-il si vous abandonnez Dieu pour le suivre ? Mon mari a dit que je ne devais pas venir à l'église ; mon mari a dit que je ne devrais pas venir au Holiness Revival Movement; mon mari a dit que je ne devrais pas quitter l'Église catholique; mon mari a dit…, Quand il mourra, où seras-tu, toi qui renonces à l'éternel pour le temporel ? Comment pouvez-vous tourner le dos au Dieu éternel pour un homme à court terme ? Vous ne pouvez pas vous tenir debout ? Refusez-lui l'obéissance dans les affaires qui contredisent la volonté de Dieu, la Parole de Dieu et les commandements du Père.  **\n3.3. DIEU EST PLUS GRAND ET MEILLEUR  **\nActes 4 verset 7 à 13  **\n7. Et lorsqu'ils les eurent placés au milieu, ils demandèrent   Par quel pouvoir ou par quel nom avez-vous fait cela ?\n8 Alors Pierre, rempli du Saint-Esprit, leur dit   Chefs du peuple et anciens d'Israël,\n9 Si aujourd'hui nous sommes interrogés sur la bonne action faite à l'homme impuissant, par quel moyen il est guéri ;\n10 Sachez à vous tous, et à tout le peuple d'Israël, que c'est par le nom de Jésus-Christ de Nazareth, que vous avez crucifié, que Dieu a ressuscité des morts, que par lui cet homme se tient ici entier devant vous.\n11 C'est la pierre qui a été rejetée par vous, bâtisseurs, qui est devenue la tête de l'angle.\n12 Il n'y a de salut en aucun autre, car il n'y a sous le ciel aucun autre nom donné parmi les hommes, par lequel nous devions être sauvés.\n13 Lorsqu'ils virent la hardiesse de Pierre et de Jean, et qu'ils virent qu'ils étaient des hommes sans instruction et ignorants, ils s'étonnèrent et reconnurent qu'ils avaient été avec Jésus.  **\nPourquoi avez-vous peur de votre mari lorsqu'il vous défie sur les questions de Dieu ; bijoux et coiffure impie? Pourquoi lui obéir quand il vous dit que vous devriez vous habiller en pantalon (pantalon) et porter un short pour sortir avec lui parce qu'il aime ça ? Pourquoi te tais-tu devant cet homme qui peut mourir à tout moment, parlant comme s'il valait mieux que Dieu ? Pourquoi n'es-tu pas audacieux ? Pourquoi as tu peur? Pourquoi caches-tu la vérité ? Ouvre ta bouche parce que tu as un père. Dieu a soutenu les trois enfants hébreux. Le mariage qui vous a réuni peut prendre fin à tout moment. Lorsque le roi de Babylone, Belshazzar, a promis à Daniel d'être le troisième commandant s'il interprétait l'écriture qu'il avait vue sur le mur, Daniel a interprété le rêve mais lui a dit de garder ses cadeaux.  **\nDaniel 5 verset 16 à 17  **\n16 Et j'ai entendu parler de toi, que tu peux faire des interprétations et dissoudre des doutes, maintenant si tu peux lire l'écriture et m'en faire connaître l'interprétation, tu seras vêtu d'écarlate et tu auras une chaîne d'or autour de toi. cou, et tu seras le troisième souverain du royaume.\n17 Alors Daniel répondit et dit devant le roi   Que tes dons soient pour toi-même, et donne tes récompenses à un autre ; cependant je lirai l'écriture au roi, et je lui en ferai connaître l'interprétation.  **\nLe royaume fut enlevé au roi, qui mourut cette nuit-là. Que peut faire votre mari ? Combien de temps vivra-t-il pour que vous vouliez abandonner Jésus pour lui ? Il peut mourir subitement dans un accident ou pour toute autre cause. Vous ne pouvez pas abandonner Jésus pour des hommes mortels. S'il vous plaît, ne laissez pas la peur des hommes vous empêcher de lui parler de Jésus.   **\nVoyez ce que les disciples ont dit lorsqu'on leur a demandé par quel nom les malades étaient guéris   « Par le nom de Jésus, que vous avez crucifié. Et nous vous disons qu'il n'y a pas d'autre nom, sous le ciel, par lequel l'homme puisse être sauvé, si ce n'est par le nom de Jésus.  **\nIls frissonnaient en eux-mêmes en disant   ces gens sont hardis ; ils ont été avec Jésus. Jésus était un homme courageux. Le Seigneur nous aide à former des femmes audacieuses et courageuses, des épouses audacieuses et courageuses, qui défendront Jésus et ignoreront le pouvoir des hommes rebelles.  **\nActes 4 verset 17 à 20  **\n17 Mais pour qu'elle ne se répande plus parmi le peuple, menaçons-le fermement de ne plus parler à personne en ce nom.\n18 Et ils les appelèrent, et leur recommandèrent de ne point parler ni enseigner au nom de Jésus.\n19 Mais Pierre et Jean répondirent et leur dirent   S'il est juste aux yeux de Dieu de vous écouter plus que Dieu, jugez-vous.\n20 Car nous ne pouvons que dire les choses que nous avons vues et entendues.  **\nFemme, pourquoi es-tu importunée par les menaces de ton mari ? Enfant, pourquoi t'inquiètes-tu que ton père ou tes parents ne paient pas tes frais de scolarité ? Faut-il aller à l'école avant d'aller au paradis ? Femme, dois-tu épouser cet homme avant d'aller au ciel ? N'avez-vous pas vu des gens sortir avec succès de l'esclavage du mariage et arriver au ciel ? Pour cette raison, beaucoup préfèrent rester célibataires.  **\nLa veuve, Anna, est restée célibataire jusqu'à l'âge de quatre-vingt-quatre ans, après avoir été mariée pendant seulement sept ans. Elle a passé soixante-dix-sept ans à aimer et à servir le Seigneur dans le jeûne et la prière dans le temple, et elle a finalement embrassé Jésus, le Dieu d'éternité. Ne voulez-vous pas embrasser Jésus au ciel ? S'il vous plaît, connaissez bien Dieu, ainsi vous n'accorderez pas autant de valeur au mariage. Vous me direz, que vais-je faire de mes enfants ? Jésus a dit, si quelqu'un vient à moi et ne s'abandonne pas, elle-même, son mari, sa femme, ses enfants, ses biens, il n'est pas apte à être mon disciple     **\nLuc 14 verset 26 à 27  **\n26 Si quelqu'un vient à moi et ne hait pas son père, sa mère, sa femme, ses enfants, ses frères et ses sœurs, oui, et sa propre vie aussi, il ne peut être mon disciple.\n27 Et quiconque ne porte pas sa croix et ne me suit pas ne peut être mon disciple. Votre mari a-t-il vraiment le pouvoir de vous envoyer ? Le Seigneur a dit que les cheveux de votre tête sont comptés ; personne ne tombera à terre si le Seigneur ne le permet.  **\nLuc 12 verset 7 à 8  **\nMais même les cheveux de votre tête sont tous comptés. Ne craignez donc rien ; vous valez plus que beaucoup de moineaux.  **\nPremiers Rois 1 verset 52  **\n52 Et Salomon dit   S'il se montre un homme digne, il ne tombera pas un cheveu de lui à terre ; mais si du mal se trouve en lui, il mourra.  **\n3.4. SOYEZ AUDACIEUX ET COURAGEUX DEVANT VOTRE MARI  **\nAucun de vos cheveux ne tombera à terre, sauf si le Seigneur le permet pour votre bénédiction. Une femme a avoué l'adultère à son mari. En colère, il a attrapé un couteau, l'a emmenée dans la chambre, a menacé de la tuer et lui a demandé de dire ses derniers mots. La femme ferma les yeux et dit   « Je dois à maman Jemima   n'oublie pas de la payer ; rappelez-vous ceci et rappelez-vous cela. J'ai fini. Tu peux aller de l'avant et me tuer. Il a jeté le couteau et s'est mis à pleurer. Il sert maintenant avec sa femme dans la foi et dans le Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide (HOREMOW)  ** \nComment voulez-vous convertir l'homme si vous n'êtes pas prêt à souffrir ? Abandonnez-vous après des menaces mineures ? Les apôtres n'étaient-ils pas menacés ? Leurs ennemis n'avaient pas le pouvoir de les tuer parce que Dieu est plus élevé et plus fort que leur pouvoir. En outre, ils opéraient sous un gouvernement organisé qui remettait en question leurs actions. Votre mari ne peut pas aller contre Dieu ou le gouvernement de la nation pour vous tuer. Alors pourquoi es-tu plein de peur ?  **\nActes 5 verset 27 à 29  **\n27 Lorsqu'ils les eurent amenés, ils les placèrent devant le conseil et le souverain sacrificateur leur demanda  \n28 Disant   Ne vous avons-nous pas formellement commandé de ne pas enseigner en ce nom ? Et voici, vous avez rempli Jérusalem de votre doctrine, et vous avez l'intention de faire venir sur nous le sang de cet homme.\n29 Alors Pierre et les autres apôtres répondirent et dirent   Nous devons obéir à Dieu plutôt qu'aux hommes.  **\nN'obéissez à aucune des demandes de votre mari qui sont contraires aux Écritures. Sinon, vous récolterez de mauvaises récompenses de la part de Dieu. Vous lui expliquerez pourquoi vous avez élevé votre mari au-dessus de Lui, le Créateur. Pourquoi avez-vous fait de votre mari une idole et ne supportez-vous pas Jésus ? Obéir à votre mari contre Dieu vous fera souffrir dans cette vie et la prochaine vie après la mort.  **\nLuc 9 verset 62  **\n62 Et Jésus lui dit   Personne, ayant mis la main à la charrue et regardant en arrière, n'est digne du royaume de Dieu.  **\nRespectez votre direction et apprenez à votre mari à respecter Dieu, sa direction. Il devrait respecter Jésus en ne vous demandant pas de désobéir à la parole et à l'ordre de Jésus. Les trois enfants hébreux dirent au roi Nebucadnetsar   « Ô roi, nous ne prenons pas soin de te répondre à ce sujet. » En d'autres termes, nous n'avons pas besoin de nous défendre devant vous. En tant que notre roi, vous êtes notre chef. Mais il y en a un qui est plus grand que vous et votre dieu. Notre Dieu nous délivrera si vous nous jetez au feu. S'Il choisit que nous mourrions, alors vous pouvez aller de l'avant. Quant à nous, nous ne vous obéirons pas dans cette affaire.  **\nDaniel 3 verset 10 à 18  **\n10 Toi, ô roi, tu as décrété que tout homme qui entendra le son du cornet, de la flûte, de la harpe, de la saqueboute, du luth et du dulcimer, et de toutes sortes de musiques, se prosternera et adorera l'image d'or,\n11 Et quiconque ne se prosterne pas et n'adore pas, afin d'être jeté au milieu d'une fournaise ardente.\n12 Il y a des Juifs que tu as établis sur les affaires de la province de Babylone, Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego ; ces hommes, ô roi, ne t'ont pas regardé, ils ne servent pas tes dieux et n'adorent pas la statue d'or que tu as dressée.\n13 Alors Nebucadnetsar, dans sa rage et sa fureur, ordonna d'amener Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego. Puis ils amenèrent ces hommes devant le roi.\n14 Nebucadnetsar prit la parole et leur dit   Est-il vrai, ô Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego, ne servez-vous pas mes dieux, et n'adorez-vous pas la statue d'or que j'ai érigée ?\n15 Maintenant, si vous êtes prêts à entendre le son du cornet, de la flûte, de la harpe, de la saqueboute, du luth et du dulcimer, et de toutes sortes de musiques, vous vous prosternez et vous adorez l'image que j'ai faite ; bien, mais si vous n'adorez pas, vous serez jetés à la même heure au milieu d'une fournaise ardente; et quel est ce Dieu qui vous délivrera de mes mains?\n16 Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego répondirent et dirent au roi   Ô Nebucadnetsar, nous ne prenons pas soin de te répondre sur cette affaire.\n17 S'il en est ainsi, notre Dieu que nous servons peut nous délivrer de la fournaise ardente, et il nous délivrera de ta main, ô roi.\n18 Mais sinon, sache, ô roi, que nous ne servirons pas tes dieux, et que nous n'adorerons pas la statue d'or que tu as dressée.  **\nPourquoi ne dites-vous pas la même chose à votre mari, qui exalte le mariage au-dessus de la vie ? Pourquoi avez-vous peur parce qu'il a menacé de vous enfermer ? Qu'est-ce que le mariage ? Est-ce la meilleure chose que les femmes apprécient en dehors de Christ ? Quelle gloire ont-ils ? Vous serez surpris d'apprendre que de nombreuses femmes souhaitent rester en dehors du mariage pour servir Jésus. Se comporter comme si vous étiez un orphelin sans Dieu est un péché. Si vous avez Dieu et que votre mari vous renvoie, sachez qu'il vous envoie à Dieu. Dieu aime ce défi parce que si vous restez juste, Il vous prendra et fera honte à cet homme. Il ne vous abandonnera pas.  **\nPsaume 27 verset 10  **\n10 Quand mon père et ma mère m'abandonneront, alors le Seigneur me relèvera.  **\nEn d'autres termes, Dieu, dans sa justice, prendra soin de moi lorsque mon mari m'abandonnera.  **\n3.5. LA TÊTE DU MARI DOIT ÊTRE RECONNUE  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 22 à 24, 33  **\n22 Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme au Seigneur.\n23 Car le mari est le chef de la femme, comme Christ est le chef de l'Église, et il est le sauveur du corps.\n24 C'est pourquoi, comme l'Église est soumise à Christ, ainsi que les femmes soient en toutes choses à leurs maris.\n33 Néanmoins, que chacun de vous en particulier aime sa femme comme lui-même ; et la femme veille à ce qu'elle respecte son mari.    **\nLa direction de l'homme sur sa femme et la famille doit être reconnue et volontairement soumise et obéie. La femme doit obéir à son mari en toutes choses qui ne contredisent pas l'obéissance à Jésus. La soumission à son mari doit être comme à Christ.  **\nParleriez-vous grossièrement à Jésus ? Frapperiez-vous, cracheriez-vous ou verseriez-vous de l'eau sur Jésus ? Si Jésus était couché étroitement, le regarderiez-vous avec mépris ? Lui refuseriez-vous de la nourriture ? Emmèneriez-vous Jésus dans le monde et le crucifieriez-vous avec des critiques ? Diriez-vous du mal de Jésus ? Pourquoi faites-vous cela de votre mari ? Voici un aperçu d'un type de femme. Pendant qu'elles étaient rassemblées, certaines femmes critiquaient leurs maris. Chacun tour à tour. La femme dont le mari avait été bon pour elle n'avait pas de mauvaise réputation. Elle pensait que si je dis à ces femmes que mon mari a été bon avec moi, elles m'envieront. Alors, elle les a rejoints avec des critiques inventées. Elle n'était pas prête à rendre gloire à Dieu pour ce que son mari faisait pour elle. Elle ressentait le besoin d'appartenir, d'être acceptée, même dans la congrégation des démons. Qu'est-ce qui vous a amené là-bas ? Pourquoi êtes-vous parmi les femmes capricieuses au point qu'elles vous font appeler le bien le mal ? Malheur à ceux qui appellent le bien mal.  **\nEsaïe 5 verset 20 à 21  **\n20 Malheur à ceux qui appellent le mal bien, et le bien mal ! qui a remplacé les ténèbres par la lumière et la lumière par les ténèbres ; qui mettent l'amer pour le doux, et le doux pour l'amer !  **\nLe Seigneur a été bon pour vous. Il t'a donné un bon mari et t'a donné une belle vie. Mais juste parce que vous devez plaire aux pécheurs, vous dites des folies. Est-ce de la gratitude envers Dieu pour ce qu'il a fait pour vous ? Vous avez prié et le Seigneur vous a donné un bon mari, mais vous voulez le dédaigner et l'embarrasser. Ne suivez pas les coutumes de cette vie.  **\nLorsqu'un homme a parlé de sa femme, il a dit qu'elle lui reprochait de ne pas l'aimer et de ne jamais lui acheter de vêtements. Un autre homme a demandé si les femmes sont programmées pour être ainsi parce que sa femme fait de même. Ne sont-elles pas capables de parler en bien de leurs maris ? C'est la voie du monde. Arrêtez ce genre de plainte; autrement, dit le Seigneur, j'ai entendu ce que vous avez dit. C'est le genre de murmure qui a privé les enfants d'Israël de la Terre Promise. Appréciez ce que Dieu fait pour vous.     **\nLes hommes et les femmes devraient apprendre à s'apprécier mutuellement et à apprécier ce que Dieu fait dans leur vie. Pourquoi lui dis-tu   \"Je regrette de t'avoir épousé ?\" Est-ce le même homme dont vous avez témoigné et dont vous exprimez maintenant des regrets ? Qu'est-ce que l'homme a fait qui vous a fait regretter ? Pouvez-vous les compter ? Pourquoi condamneriez-vous votre mari pour une seule erreur ? L'homme ne s'efforce-t-il pas, ne perfectionne-t-il pas la sainteté et n'apprend-il pas davantage en Christ ? Arrêtez les choses qui provoquent la colère des conjoints et ruinent un mariage. Parlez bien de votre conjoint.  **\nEphésiens 4 verset 29  **\n29 Qu'aucune communication corrompue ne sorte de votre bouche, mais celle qui est bonne à l'usage d'édifier, afin qu'elle apporte la grâce aux auditeurs.  **\n3.6. LA SOUMISSION DEMANDÉE AUX ÉPOUSES  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 22 à 24  **\n22 Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme au Seigneur.\n23 Car le mari est le chef de la femme, comme Christ est le chef de l'Église, et il est le sauveur du corps.\n24C'est pourquoi, comme l'Eglise est soumise à Christ, ainsi que les femmes soient en toutes choses à leurs maris.  **\nPrenez note du fait que vous devez vous soumettre EN TOUT. Le Seigneur attend de vous que vous obéissiez à TOUS les commandements car vous êtes en Christ. Parce que vous êtes mariée, le Seigneur attend de vous que vous obéissiez à TOUS les commandements de votre mari.  **\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 5 à 7  **\n5 Car c'est ainsi qu'autrefois les saintes femmes, qui se confiaient en Dieu, se paraient elles-mêmes, étant soumises à leurs propres maris.\n6 De même que Sara obéit à Abraham, l'appelant Seigneur, dont vous êtes les filles, pourvu que vous agissiez bien et que vous ne craigniez aucun étonnement.\n7 De même, vous les maris, demeurez avec eux selon la connaissance, honorant la femme, comme au vase le plus faible, et comme étant héritiers ensemble de la grâce de la vie ; que vos prières ne soient pas entravées.  **\n\nSara a appelé Abraham, Seigneur ! Cela montre le degré d'honneur qu'elle avait pour son mari. Cela montre le degré d'humilité qu'elle a exercé envers son mari. Elle ne s'est pas contentée de l'appeler seigneur, mais l'a montré dans ses actions en obéissant à ses conseils même lorsqu'ils étaient inappropriés. C'est la preuve qu'elle respectait son mari.  **\nDans votre cas, ne péchez pas contre Dieu dans votre obéissance à votre mari ; exercer ce degré d'honneur et de respect. Exercez-le dans vos paroles et vos actions. C'est ce que Dieu attend ou exige de vous. Couvrez-vous la tête. Ne soyez pas fier, ne dites pas que vous êtes égal à lui. Quels que soient votre diplôme, vos qualifications ou votre situation financière, couvrez-vous la tête. Ne laissez pas votre tête nue comme l'homme. Comprenez cela, pratiquez-le. Les enfants aussi doivent être obéissants et soumis à leur père ; c'est leur devoir.  **\nLa femme ne doit pas accepter l'autorité indue du mari sur elle, ce qui la conduirait au péché et à la rébellion contre le Christ, leur chef suprême. Elle doit résister à cela jusqu'à la séparation. Elle ne doit pas usurper l'autorité du mari dans la maison, ce que Dieu interdit. La femme incroyante voudrait retenir son mari, en utilisant des pouvoirs de sorcellerie naturels et non naturels. Les croyants doivent s'assurer qu'ils épousent des croyants. Pour une femme, considérer son mari comme commun est un péché.  **\nPremier Timothée 2 verset 12 à 14  **\n12 Mais je ne permets pas à une femme d'enseigner, ni d'usurper l'autorité sur l'homme, mais de se taire.\n13 Car Adam a été formé le premier, puis Eve.\n14 Et Adam n'a pas été trompé, mais la femme trompée était dans la transgression.  **\nLa femme, Eve, s'est transmise et a contracté Satan dans le jardin. N'oubliez pas le contrôle de votre mari pour vous sauver, vous et votre famille, de la chute. Satan savait qu'il n'aurait pas trompé Adam, alors il est allé voir Eve.  **\nVous êtes désormais aux commandes des affaires familiales tandis que votre mari vous suit. Cette famille s'effondrera parce que Dieu ne vous a pas donné la direction. Même les démons le savent. Satan respecte l'homme parce que c'est l'ordination de Dieu. Femme, cède à ton mari ; ne sous-estimez pas son entendement parce qu'il est doux et calme ; lui laisser la place d'exercer son autorité; Ecoute le.   **\n« J'écoute mon Père, j'entends de mon Père, et j'annonce ce que j'entends de mon Père. » C'est ce que Jésus a dit. Suivez son exemple. Ne soyez pas bavard. Vous ne pouvez pas être un bon auditeur quand vous parlez trop. Vous usurpez l'autorité. Le chemin vers le ciel est étroit ; beaucoup de femmes le manquent à cette époque de régression.  **\n\nDEUXIEME PARTIE  **\nVIVRE LA VIE PIEUSE DANS LE MARIAGE AVEC UN PARTENAIRE IMPIE (CONJOINT)  **\n\nCHAPITRE 4  **\nMARIAGE AVEC UN PARTENAIRE IMPIE  **\nSi vous êtes croyant et que votre partenaire ne l'est pas, quelque chose ne va pas. Qu'est-ce que c'est? Vous avez épousé un incroyant. Comment pouvez-vous encore être pieux ? Comment pouvez-vous être saint et qualifié pour l'enlèvement ? Comment pouvez-vous réussir avec cet incroyant ? Les mêmes principes ne contrôlent pas votre conjoint incroyant comme vous l'êtes. C'est la cause profonde de vos difficultés. La Bible nous dit de ne pas être sous un joug inégal avec les incroyants.  **\n2 Corinthiens 6 verset 14 à 16  **\n14 Ne soyez-vous pas sous un joug inégal avec les non-croyants, car quelle relation y a-t-il entre la justice et l'injustice ? Et quelle communion a la lumière avec les ténèbres ?\n15 Et quelle concorde a Christ avec Bélial ? Ou quelle part a celui qui croit avec un infidèle ?\n16 Et quel accord le temple de Dieu a-t-il avec les idoles ? Car vous êtes le temple du Dieu vivant ; comme Dieu l'a dit, j'habiterai en eux et je marcherai en eux; et je serai leur Dieu, et ils seront mon peuple.  **\nQu'est-ce qui vous a amené à cette relation ? Nous ne pouvons pas dire sortir du mariage. C'est une union qui vous a unis jusqu'à la mort.   **\n4.1. RAISONS DES MARIAGES IMPIES  **\nQu'est-ce qui vous a amené dans cette relation conjugale impie ? Ce qui suit peut expliquer cela.  **\n4.1.1. VOUS VOUS MARIEZ AVANT LA CONVERSION AU CHRIST  **\nDeux d'entre vous étaient incroyants, vous étiez donc libres de vous marier sans l'aide divine. Vous vous êtes marié en tant que pécheur et vous vous êtes converti pendant le mariage. Vous êtes sauvé, mais votre conjoint ne l'est pas. Dans un tel cas, vous êtes en union de mariage avec une personne impie.  **\n 4.1.2. VOUS VOUS MARIEZ EN CHRIST, MAIS VOTRE PARTENAIRE RÉCUPÈRE APRÈS LE MARIAGE  **\nVous étiez tous les deux dans la lumière, suivant la vérité, adhérant aux Écritures, servant Dieu, adorant Dieu et croyant en la Bible. La Bible vous contrôlait, mais plus tard, votre partenaire a rétrogradé. Maintenant, vous commencez à vous demander ce qui s'est passé. Il a été emporté par la tentation. Cela a commencé sur de bonnes bases, mais c'est maintenant terminé, vous seul maintenant votre droiture. Louez Dieu, vous demeurez en Christ. Mais il a quitté Jésus et est maintenant avec Satan. Il est actuellement dans les ténèbres vous apportant tourments et chagrins.  **\n4.1.3. VOUS VOUS MARIEZ EN CHRIST MAIS AVEC UNE PERSONNE PAS VRAIMENT CONVERTIE  **\nVous avez été trompé. Peut-être n'avez-vous pas bien prié ou avez-vous pensé que la personne était de Dieu parce qu'elle était active dans l'église, enseignant, prêchant et évangélisant, mais n'était pas vraiment convertie. Les sensations de votre corps vous émouvaient ; vous avez marché à vue ou vous étiez pressé et n'avez pas prié jusqu'au bout. Vous n'avez pas eu assez de temps pour prier efficacement pour le mariage, alors vous l'avez choisi ou accepté parce que vous êtes ensemble dans la chorale et l'équipe d'évangélisation. Mais maintenant, vous savez qu'elle n'est pas vraiment convertie. Celui qui est né de la chair est chair. Elle ne peut pas poursuivre la justice parce qu'elle est charnelle. Ceux qui sont charnels ne peuvent plaire à Dieu ; ce n'est pas possible.\nRomains 8 verset 8 Ainsi donc ceux qui sont dans la chair ne peuvent plaire à Dieu.  **\n4.1.4. VOUS AVEZ EPOUSE VOLONTAIREMENT UN INCROYANT EN PENSANT A CONVERTIR VOTRE PARTENAIRE  **\nVous faites partie de ceux qui croient qu'ils peuvent convertir les gens et pensent à tort qu'ils ont le pouvoir de conversion. Vous pensez que vous êtes une machine spirituelle capable de transformer n'importe quoi en poudre ; vous pouvez transformer la poudre en solide, transformer l'eau en gaz ou condenser le gaz en solide. Vous avez dit   « … donnez-moi quelqu'un, et je m'occuperai de lui. Es-tu plus sage que Dieu ? Vous n'avez pas considéré l'Écriture. Alors Dieu t'a permis d'être comme le fils prodigue. Vous avez rétrogradé. Mais Dieu merci, la miséricorde vous a ramené à la justice. Vous avez trouvé le mari que vous vouliez. Comment va votre mari? Il va bien, mais la vie ne va pas bien. C'est un incroyant; vous avez découvert que tous vos principes, votre pouvoir et vos stratégies pour le convertir ne fonctionnent pas. Vous êtes quotidiennement face à face avec un incroyant !  **\n4.1.5. VOUS AVEZ ÉTÉ FORCÉ PAR UNE CIRCONSTANCE DE VOUS MARIER.  **\nPeut-être avez-vous rétrogradé et couché avec une femme, elle est tombée enceinte et vous avez été contraint ou obligé de l'épouser. C'est une tentation dans laquelle tu es tombé. Oui, vous avez continué jusqu'au mariage; vous avez cédé à la pression extérieure et vous vous êtes marié. Maintenant, vous êtes rétabli, mais vous avez une femme incroyante.  **\n4.2. QUI EST UN INCROYANT ?  **\n2 Corinthiens 6 verset 14 à 16  **\n14 Ne soyez-vous pas sous un joug inégal avec les non-croyants, car quelle relation y a-t-il entre la justice et l'injustice ? et quelle communion a la lumière avec les ténèbres ?\n15 Et quelle concorde a Christ avec Bélial ? ou quelle part a celui qui croit avec un infidèle?\n16 Et quel accord le temple de Dieu a-t-il avec les idoles ? car vous êtes le temple du Dieu vivant; comme Dieu l'a dit, j'habiterai en eux et je marcherai en eux; et je serai leur Dieu, et ils seront mon peuple.  **\nCe mot est plus haut qu'une montagne, plus profond qu'une vallée, plus large que le désert. Ayons une idée de qui est un incroyant. Quel type de péché l'incroyant commet-il ? Le conjoint incroyant a la liberté de commettre le genre de péchés qu'il veut parce qu'il n'est pas sous le contrôle de Dieu. Il ne connaît pas Jésus. Il ne connaît pas le Saint-Esprit, la vérité ou le chemin.  **\nEphésiens 2 verset 11 à 12  **\n11 C'est pourquoi, souvenez-vous que vous, étant dans le temps passés Gentils dans la chair, qui sont appelés incirconcisions par ce qu'on appelle la circoncision dans la chair faite par les mains ;\n12 qu'en ce temps-là vous étiez sans Christ, étrangers à la communauté d'Israël et étrangers aux alliances de la promesse, sans espérance et sans Dieu dans le monde  **\nL'incrédule est encore incirconcis de cœur ; le cœur n'a pas été altéré par le pouvoir de la justice. Il ne connaît pas Jésus. Jésus n'est pas Seigneur et Sauveur pour votre conjoint. Il n'est pas conscient des promesses de Dieu, des promesses de jugement qui rendent les gens conscients du péché et l'évitent, des promesses de bénédiction qui donneront envie aux gens de servir Dieu. Il n'est pas conscient du ciel et de l'enfer. Il ne connaît pas l'enfer et ne s'en soucie pas. Elle n'a pas peur de l'enfer. Elle n'a aucun espoir du ciel et n'a pas hâte d'aller au ciel, car quiconque a cet espoir se purifie. Elle n'a aucun espoir d'hériter d'un manoir au paradis. Pour elle, Dieu n'existe pas. Dieu ne la contrôle pas; elle ne craint pas Dieu et ne sert pas Dieu.  **\nQui est un incroyant ? Que dit l'Écriture ? L'incroyant est injuste. Ils prennent plaisir à l'injustice, à faire ce qui est mal et pas bien, ce qui nuirait à votre vie et vous conduirait à la honte, à la disgrâce et bien plus encore.  **\nL'incroyant est ténèbres. Comment marcher avec les ténèbres ? Comment vivez-vous dans les ténèbres, là où il n'y a pas de lumière ? Comment vivez-vous dans une maison sans lumière, sans bougies ? Lorsque la lumière du jour se lève, elle n'atteint pas votre maison. Ne soyez pas inégalement attelés ! Vous, qui n'êtes pas encore mariés, prenez cela au sérieux.  **\nL'incroyant est Bélial, ou Satan, un enfant de Satan. Celui avec qui vous devez lutter dans ce mariage est Satan. Votre conjoint appartient à Satan et travaille pour lui. Dieu n'a pas encore vaincu votre conjoint ! Les actes de Satan, il les fera.  **\nL'Écriture ci-dessous montre certaines des pratiques de l'incroyant    **\nGalates 5 verset 19 à 21  **\n19 Or les oeuvres de la chair sont manifestes, lesquelles sont celles-ci; L'adultère, la fornication, l'impureté, la luxure,\n20 Idolâtrie, sorcellerie, haine, désaccord, émulations, colère, querelles, séditions, hérésies,\n21 Les envies, les meurtres, l'ivrognerie, les débauches, et autres choses semblables, dont je vous parle auparavant, comme je vous l'ai aussi dit dans le passé, que ceux qui commettent de telles choses n'hériteront pas le royaume de Dieu.  **\nL'incroyant est dans la chair. Ils servent des idoles et pratiquent la sorcellerie à laquelle ils ont peut-être été initiés dès l'enfance. Ils ont la haine dans le cœur et manquent d'amour véritable   ils sont contrôlés par l'esprit de compétition dans la maison car personne ne doit être plus grand qu'eux. Ils boivent et s'enivrent, vomissent, tombent par terre et se battent, dansent et tuent. L'incroyant a tendance à faire ces choses. Leur conscience peut ne pas les condamner parce qu'ils ne connaissent pas Dieu ou les Écritures.  **\nLa Bible avertit que le croyant ne doit pas épouser un incroyant. Le conjoint incroyant est tenu de commettre ces péchés à cause de la présence du péché dans sa vie. Tels que   l'adultère, l'idolâtrie, l'ivresse, le mensonge, la sorcellerie, la haine, la colère, la désobéissance, la polygamie, la polyandrie et la méchanceté. Voler fait partie de leur mode de vie, et la vérité est loin d'eux. Comment vivre avec quelqu'un qui ne dit pas la vérité ?  **\nAvec tous ces défis, quelle est l'exigence morale de Dieu envers ses enfants qui doit être respectée ? Dieu ne veut pas que vous envisagiez d'avoir un conjoint incroyant.  **\n\nCHAPITRE 5  **\nLES EXIGENCES DE DIEU DANS LE MARIAGE  **\nQuelles sont les exigences de Dieu dans votre vie, peu importe avec qui vous êtes marié ?  **\n5.1.1. NE FAITES PAS VOTRE VIE APRÈS VOS ANCIENNES FAÇONS  **\nNe vivez pas comme vous viviez dans le passé.  **\nPremier Pierre 1 verset 14  **\n14Comme des enfants obéissants, ne vous façonnant pas selon les anciennes convoitises dans votre ignorance  **\nNe vivez pas le type de vie que vous avez vécu lorsque vous ignoriez Dieu et ne connaissiez pas Jésus. Vous pourriez alors combattre ou comploter le mal et battre votre partenaire. Vous devez arrêter de telles pratiques en tant que croyant parce que vous êtes une nouvelle personne.   **\n2 Corinthiens 5 verset 17  **\n17 C'est pourquoi, si quelqu'un est en Christ, il est une nouvelle créature, les choses anciennes sont passées ; voici, toutes choses sont devenues nouvelles.  **\nNe façonnez donc pas votre vie d'après le passé. Si vous voulez maintenir votre victoire en tant qu'enfant de Dieu, ne vous fâchez pas, ne vous battez pas et ne soyez pas abusif. N'utilisez pas de charmes pour que votre partenaire vous aime. Vous ne pouvez plus faire cela; vous êtes maintenant en Christ.  **\n5.1.2. METTEZ LE NOUVEL HOMME  **\nEn présence de votre partenaire incroyant, vivez la vie de l'homme nouveau que vous êtes en Jésus-Christ. À cette époque, vous vous battiez et vous échangeiez des coups. Vous saviez comment vous comporter avec votre mari pendant qu'il dormait. Mais vous ne pouvez plus faire cela parce que vous avez revêtu l'homme nouveau.  **\nEphésiens 4 verset 23 à 32  **\n23Et sois renouvelé dans l'esprit de ton esprit;\n24 Et que vous revêtiez l'homme nouveau, qui selon Dieu est créé dans la justice et la vraie sainteté.\n25C'est pourquoi, renonçant au mensonge, dites chacun la vérité à son prochain, car nous sommes membres l'un de l'autre. 26 Soyez en colère, et ne péchez pas. Que le soleil ne se couche pas sur ta colère ; 27 Ni donner lieu au diable.\n28 Que celui qui a volé ne vole plus, mais qu'il travaille plutôt, travaillant de ses mains\n73 bonne chose, afin qu'il doive la donner à celui qui en a besoin.\n29 Qu'aucune communication corrompue ne sorte de votre bouche, mais celle qui est bonne à l'usage d'édifier, afin qu'elle apporte la grâce aux auditeurs.\n30 Et n'attristez pas le saint Esprit de Dieu, par lequel vous êtes scellés pour le jour de la rédemption.\n31 Que toute amertume, et colère, et colère, et clameur, et médisance soient éloignées de vous, avec toute malveillance ;\n32 Et soyez bons les uns envers les autres, compatissants, vous pardonnant les uns aux autres, comme Dieu vous a pardonné à cause de Christ.    **\nMême si votre partenaire ne craint pas Dieu, ne vous obéit pas, ne vous aime pas, pratique le mal et abuse de vous en présence d'amis et d'enfants, vous devez revêtir l'homme nouveau qui, après Dieu, est créé dans la justice et la vérité. sainteté. Vous devez être juste et saint en présence de votre partenaire conjugal et des maux commis. Dites la vérité avec votre conjoint. Ne faites pas semblant d'avoir de l'argent alors que vous n'en avez pas. Ne mentez plus.  **\nLorsque votre conjoint vous provoque, ne vous fâchez pas et ne parlez pas de manière abusive. En tant que femme, ne privez pas votre mari de nourriture. Suivez l'instruction scripturaire qui dit que si votre ennemi a faim, nourrissez-le ; donnez-lui de l'eau à boire s'il a soif.  **\nRomains 12 verset 20 à 21  **\n20 Si donc ton ennemi a faim, nourris-le; s'il a soif, donne-lui à boire, car en agissant ainsi tu amasseras des charbons ardents sur sa tête.\n21 Ne te laisse pas vaincre par le mal, mais surmonte le mal par le bien.  **\nEn tant que mari, ne privez pas votre femme d'argent pour la nourriture parce que vous n'êtes pas satisfait d'elle. Qu'elle donne naissance à des enfants ou non, vous devez la nourrir et la vêtir. C'est votre responsabilité divine. Dans l'Ancien Testament, le Seigneur dit à Osée d'épouser une prostituée. Dieu lui a ordonné de supporter ses péchés et son mauvais caractère. En tant qu'Israélite, la prostituée était éligible au mariage en étant un enfant de l'alliance. Cela ne peut pas être fait aujourd'hui parce que tous les chrétiens professés ne sont pas des enfants de l'alliance.  **\nLorsque votre conjoint vole votre argent, ne volez pas l'argent de votre conjoint ou quoi que ce soit en représailles. Ne vous cachez pas vos dépenses les uns aux autres. Vous êtes une nouvelle créature (verset 28).  **\nAvec tout son entêtement, prononcez des paroles de bénédiction reflétant Christ en vous. Ne crachez pas d'insultes sur votre partenaire. C'est un langage corrompu. Si votre conjoint incroyant vous parle ainsi, ne répondez pas. S'il vous plaît, ne dites rien qui puisse le mettre davantage en colère. Quoi que votre partenaire incroyant vous fasse, ce n'est pas pire que l'enfer. S'il vous plaît, ne vous joignez pas à eux dans leur comportement injuste.\nNe répondez pas au langage corrompu de l'injustice. Vous n'avez pas d'autre choix que de rechercher la justice dans votre mariage et votre famille (verset 29).  **\nVous êtes scellé. Ne prenez aucune mesure que le Saint-Esprit ne voudra pas, ce qui l'attristera et finira par vous quitter (verset 30). Etre gentil. Ne portez pas l'offense de l'année dernière, du mois dernier, de la semaine dernière, d'hier à aujourd'hui (verset 31). Cela aiderait si vous appreniez à pardonner à votre partenaire. Lorsque vous voyagez, revenez avec un cadeau pour montrer votre amour et votre prévenance même lorsque vous êtes séparés (verset 32).  **\n5.1.3. VOUS DEVEZ VIVRE DANS L'AMOUR  **\nVous devez apprendre à vivre dans l'amour avec votre partenaire incroyant.  **\nPremier Jean 4 verset 7 à 8  **\n7 Bien-aimés, aimons-nous les uns les autres car l'amour est de Dieu, et quiconque aime est né de Dieu et connaît Dieu.\n8 Celui qui n'aime pas ne connaît pas Dieu; car Dieu est amour.  **\nSi vous aimez tout le monde sauf votre partenaire incroyant à cause de son comportement envers vous, vous avez échoué en tant qu'enfant de Dieu. Celui qui n'aime pas n'est pas de Dieu ; n'est pas né de nouveau. Si vous allez dans une maison et entendez l'homme dire des mensonges à sa femme, cela signifie que le christianisme a été affecté. Dis la vérité à ta femme. Soyez gentil et compatissant avec elle. Abstenez-vous de toutes les apparences du mal. S'abstenir de tout mal ou d'avoir de mauvaises intentions.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 5 verset 22  **\t \nAbstenez-vous de toute apparence de mal.  **\nQue le Seigneur vous accorde sa grâce si vous êtes marié à un ivrogne car vous devrez faire face à la puanteur de l'ivresse. Vous devez le supporter parce que vous ne pouvez pas refuser votre corps à votre épouse même si elle est une incroyante ou une femme à femmes. S'il vous plaît, ne dites pas que je ne mangerai pas sa nourriture; Je ne lui donnerai pas mon corps.  **\n5.1.4. SOYEZ SAINT COMME DIEU EST SAINT  **\nPremier Pierre 1 verset 14 à 17  **\n14 Comme des enfants obéissants, ne vous façonnant pas selon les anciennes convoitises dans votre ignorance ;\n15 Mais comme celui qui vous a appelés est saint, soyez saints dans toutes sortes de conversations ; 16 Parce qu'il est écrit   Soyez saints ; car je suis saint.\n17 Et si vous invoquez le Père, qui, sans égard pour les personnes, juge selon l'œuvre de chacun, passez le temps de votre séjour ici dans la crainte  **\nNe vivez pas avec votre partenaire dans la peur. La timidité ou un cœur craintif vous feront faire des compromis avec lui et vous pousseront hors des limites de la justice.\nMême si vous trouvez votre conjoint compromettant avec une autre personne, par exemple, en rentrant à la maison et en voyant qu'il a une relation extraconjugale, assurez-vous de ne pas vous éloigner de la droiture. Brillez comme une lumière sur cette obscurité ou ce défi dans votre mariage.  **\nPhilippiens 2 verset 15 à 17  **\n15Afin que vous soyez irréprochables et innocents, fils de Dieu, sans reproche, au milieu d'une nation perverse et perverse, au milieu de laquelle vous brillez comme des flambeaux dans le monde;\n16 Proclamant la parole de vie; afin que je me réjouisse au jour de Christ, de n'avoir pas couru en vain, ni travaillé en vain. 17 Oui, et si je suis offert en sacrifice et au service de votre foi, je me réjouis et je me réjouis avec vous tous.  **\nEn tant que mari, vous devez rester irréprochable devant votre femme. Ne soyez pas un instrument entre les mains de Satan pour la blesser. En tant qu'enfant de Dieu, vous devez être pur et servir de lumière.  **\nEn tant qu'épouse, vous devez vous assurer que vous n'avez pris aucune mesure pour blesser, empoisonner, tuer, critiquer ou répandre ses erreurs dans la société. Ne lui faites pas de commérages et ne le médisez pas. C'est mal et cela ne peut apporter une solution au problème. L'homme vous accusera de ternir sa réputation. Dire à tous vos amis et relations les faiblesses de votre mari n'aidera pas la situation. Annoncez la parole de vie; pratiquez cette parole de vie   les doctrines de la justice et de la vérité. Votre droiture doit rester parfaite dans votre attitude envers votre conjoint et vos enfants.  **\nPourquoi enseigne-t-on cela ? Nous le faisons pour vous empêcher de travailler en vain. Nous ne voulons pas guider des gens qui n'iront pas au ciel. Nous ne voulons pas travailler, enseigner, prier et jeûner pour des gens qui n'iront pas au ciel. Nous prions que Dieu vous délivre de toute sorte de péché et de mal.  **\n5.2. INSTRUCTIONS A LA FEMME D'UN MARI IMPIE  **\nQue dit Dieu à vous qui êtes mariées à un mari incroyant ?  **\n5.2.1 OBÉISSEZ À VOTRE MARI EN TOUTES CHOSES.  **\nVoici ce que dit l'Écriture.  **\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 1 à 5  **\nDe même, femmes, soyez soumises à vos propres maris ; que, si quelqu'un n'obéit pas à la parole, il peut aussi, sans la parole, être gagné par la conversation des épouses ; 2 Pendant qu'ils contemplent ta conversation chaste accompagnée de peur.\n3 Dont la parure ne soit pas cette parure extérieure de tresser les cheveux, et de porter de l'or, ou de se vêtir ;\n4 Mais que ce soit l'homme caché du cœur, dans ce qui n'est pas corruptible, même l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille, qui est de grand prix aux yeux de Dieu.\n5 Car de cette manière dans les temps anciens aussi les saintes femmes, qui se confiaient en Dieu, se paraient elles-mêmes, étant soumises à leurs propres maris  **\nLes saintes femmes font face à des situations difficiles, mais elles font confiance à Dieu. Votre mari n'est peut-être pas croyant ou il est d'une autre religion. C'est un pécheur à 100%, faisant le mal impensable; vous avez toujours la responsabilité de lui obéir.  **\nPratiquez la droiture et la sainteté pendant que vous vivez avec votre mari. Respectez-le même dans son péché ou son mal. Vivez avec droiture afin que pendant qu'il regarde votre vie, même s'il ne vous apprécie pas, Dieu qui est avec vous le convaincra par votre vie. Le Seigneur doit passer par vous pour le convertir. Ne pensez pas que si vous vous habillez comme il veut, en incroyant, ou si vous vous coiffez comme les femmes du monde, vous le gagnerez. Si vous faites cela, vous mécontenterez Dieu, la seule personne qui peut convertir votre mari et le délivrer de Satan.  **\nSi vous suivez le chemin du péché, vous le manquerez. C'est pourquoi l'Écriture ci-dessus dit que vous ne pouvez pas le gagner en tressant vos cheveux avec des coiffures impies. Les saintes femmes d'autrefois, qui souffraient de la même condition que vous, n'ont jamais surmonté leur situation de cette façon. Elles n'ont pas surmonté leurs difficultés en portant de l'or ou des bijoux devant leurs maris.  **\nMettre des vêtements de fantaisie ou exposer votre corps à travers la façon dont vous vous habillez ne vous aidera pas non plus. Vous pourriez dire   « Ne cherche-t-il pas des femmes nues ? Alors, je vais m'habiller pour le séduire. Cela signifie que vous vivez pour votre mari, pas pour Dieu.  **\nMalheureusement, il connaît trop bien votre soupe et veut maintenant une soupe cuisinée par une autre femme. Donc, quelle que soit la façon dont vous garnissez votre soupe, ce n'est pas la solution. C'est la grâce de Dieu seule qui le sauvera. Maintenez la voie de la vérité, de la justice et de la sainteté dans votre relation avec lui afin que Dieu lui-même intervienne dans votre cas.  **\nC'est pourquoi votre parure doit être l'homme caché du cœur. C'est la justice qui plaît à Dieu.\nVotre mari peut le dédaigner, mais cela plaît à Dieu. Vous devez embellir votre cœur avec ce qui n'est pas corruptible Ne parez pas votre corps d'ornements en pensant que vous vous ferez plus belle devant votre mari, pour être acceptée et chérie par lui. Satan vous combat à travers votre mari, et vous ne pouvez pas le vaincre en suivant la voie de la chair. Votre parure doit être l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille. Quelle belle chose d'avoir une femme calme, douce et humble ! Cela brisera l'homme; cela l'humiliera. Quand tu es en bas, pour descendre vers toi, ton mari doit se baisser. Par conséquent, vous le tirez vers vous avec votre humilité. Vous devez avoir un esprit doux et calme ; cet esprit ne répond pas; il ne répond pas durement. Soyez aussi silencieux que Jésus devant le tribunal de jugement. Ils s'émerveillaient de sa tranquillité à son honneur.  **\nPrésentez un caractère pieux, et Dieu l'utilisera sur votre mari pour son salut parce que les saintes femmes d'autrefois vivaient de cette façon. Ils s'habillaient modestement, pas de manière flamboyante, pas de bijoux, pas de nudité. Ils ne dépendaient pas des styles ou des coiffures selon la mode du monde. C'est ce que veut ton mari quand tu mets de faux cheveux chinois et indiens ? Ce n'est pas la voie de l'Écriture. Suivez la voie de Dieu comme indiqué dans les Écritures, et Dieu viendra à votre rencontre pour votre salut, votre protection et votre confort.  **\n5.2.2. NE DIVORCE PAS, SAUF POUR SÉPARATION, EN RAISON DE SITUATIONS INSUPPORTABLES.  **\n1 Corinthiens 7 versets 10 à 13  **\n10 Et aux mariés, je n'ordonne pas à moi, mais au Seigneur, que la femme ne se sépare pas de son mari,\n11Mais si elle s'en va, qu'elle reste célibataire ou qu'elle se réconcilie avec son mari , et que le mari ne répudie pas sa femme.\n12Mais c'est moi, et non le Seigneur, qui dis aux autres  Si un frère a une femme qui ne croit pas, et qu'il lui plaise d'habiter avec lui, qu'il ne la répudie pas.\n13 Et la femme qui a un mari qui ne croit pas, et s'il lui plaît d'habiter avec elle, qu'elle ne le quitte pas.  **\nNotez la différence entre les conseils de l'apôtre Paul et le commandement du Seigneur. Il a d'abord donné le commandement du Seigneur dans les versets 10 et 11. Mais pour le reste, il a donné des conseils, pas un commandement du Seigneur.  **\nSi un homme a une incroyante pour épouse, il ne doit pas divorcer d'elle parce qu'elle est une ivrogne, une sorcière, un adultère ou tout autre péché qu'elle commet volontairement. Parce qu'elle est incroyante, elle peut commettre n'importe quel péché, y compris l'adultère. Ceux qui disent que si votre femme commet un adultère, vous devez la répudier ne comprennent pas l'Écriture. Il en va de même si l'homme est l'adultère. Si l'homme désire toujours vivre avec vous en tant qu'époux, la Bible est claire   ne divorcez pas.  **\nSi votre femme s'habille de manière mondaine, porte des pantalons, porte des cheveux de démons, mais elle est toujours disposée à rester dans le mariage, à cuisiner pour vous, à se donner à vous ou à s'occuper de vos enfants, ne la renvoyez pas .  **\nQue faire si vous avez un mari qui ne connaît pas Dieu et ne veut pas connaître Dieu mais choisit de rester marié avec vous ? Ne pensez pas que vous devez le quitter pour servir Dieu. L'homme vous a-t-il demandé de partir ? Tu n'es pas obligé d'y aller. Selon son incrédulité, il peut même prendre plus d'épouses, une deuxième, une troisième ou une quatrième, vous faisant le partager avec d'autres femmes ; vous devrez peut-être attendre deux semaines qu'il fasse sa tournée avant de vous rejoindre. S'il est toujours prêt à être votre mari, vous n'avez pas à manifester de la colère et de la fierté et à quitter le mariage.  **\nC'est le conseil de Paul pour vous, et c'est un conseil scripturaire. Ensuite, il donne les raisons pour lesquelles le conjoint ne devrait pas partir.  **\n1 Corinthiens 7 versets 14 à 15  **\n14 Car le mari incroyant est sanctifié par la femme, et la femme incroyante est sanctifiée par le mari, sinon vos enfants seraient impurs ; mais maintenant ils sont saints.\n15 Mais si l'incrédule s'en va, qu'il s'en aille. Un frère ou une sœur n'est pas asservi dans de tels cas ; mais Dieu nous a appelés à la paix.  **\nDieu est en vous; Jésus est en vous. En conséquence, les gens de cette maison se retrouvent en présence du Seigneur. Il peut les toucher à tout moment. Dieu travaille aussi avec vous. Lorsque vos frères vous rendent visite et partagent la Parole, votre mari en profite, même s'il ne semble pas y prêter attention. Il est mieux loti qu'un pécheur qui n'entend pas la Parole. La présence de Dieu le couvre donc aussi. S'il pleut, l'abri que Dieu vous offre le protégera aussi. Les sorcières et les sorciers ne peuvent pas lui faire de mal car vous êtes là. Il est protégé.  **\nDe même, votre présence est une bénédiction pour votre femme incroyante parce que la présence du Seigneur la couvre. Elle est en présence du Seigneur à cause de vous. Lorsque vos frères vous rendront visite à vous et à elle, ils la salueront, partageront avec elle, la béniront et prieront pour elle. Alors, s'il vous plaît, ne la renvoyez pas. Elle vous respectera et sera disposée à rester dans le mariage lorsqu'elle observera votre vie juste et sainte et verra que vous ne répondez pas durement à ses péchés.  **\nQu'arrive-t-il aux enfants si elle part? Elle peut les emmener avec elle, et les enfants iront dans l'obscurité totale. Si elle est musulmane, vous perdrez entièrement les enfants. Si elle part, elle les emmène dans la servitude de l'Islam. Mais si elle reste avec vous, ils peuvent entendre la Parole, prier avec vous et copier de nombreuses autres attitudes pieuses, et peuvent être convertis à Jésus.  **\nPourquoi voulez-vous renvoyer la femme ? Pourquoi veux-tu quitter l'homme ? Cela affectera les enfants. L'homme peut accompagner les enfants ou vous traduire en justice pour les enfants. Les tribunaux peuvent lui accorder la garde des enfants, et vous les perdez. Par conséquent, restez avec l'homme puisqu'il le veut, ou pour le bien des enfants qui peuvent être sauvés en Christ à cause de votre présence.  **\nLe verset 15 conseille que si le partenaire incroyant veut partir, qu'il parte pour la paix. Laissez partir le fils prodigue. Pourquoi doit-il vous troubler au détriment de votre paix alors que Dieu vous a appelé à la paix ? Si votre mari vous maltraite régulièrement, vous frappe, vous terrifie, puis vous demande de partir, s'il vous plaît, partez et gardez la paix ; sinon, vous ne pourrez pas pratiquer la vie chrétienne car vous serez constamment harcelé et tenté. Un jour, vous arriverez à riposter, à échanger des coups, et pourrez même réussir à le vaincre physiquement. Mais votre christianisme aura disparu. Partez et Dieu prendra soin de vous.  **\n1 Corinthiens 7 verset 16  **\n16 Car que sais-tu, femme, si tu sauveras ton mari ? Ou comment sais-tu, ô homme, si tu sauveras ta femme ?  **\nPourquoi continuer à vous soumettre à la torture, à la douleur ou à la souffrance ? Partir   mais vous dites « je veux qu'il se convertisse ». Qui vous a dit que vous finiriez par réussir à convertir votre partenaire ? Est-ce tout le monde qui se convertit ? Tout le monde ne sera pas converti. Vous avez des relations à qui vous avez prêché et travaillé pour leur salut. Beaucoup de vos parents sont morts dans leurs péchés, malgré vos efforts. ont-ils été convertis ? Permettez à votre conjoint de partir pour que vous puissiez vous sauver.  ** \nElle peut revenir si elle part et se convertit demain comme le fils prodigue. Permettez-lui d'aller apprendre les expériences de la vie qui peuvent l'amener à se repentir. Il est sage de laisser partir le fils prodigue. Si vous quittez l'homme et qu'il se convertit demain, il peut revenir pour vous. Vous pouvez l'avoir à nouveau.  **\nUne femme qui se sépare de son mari ne peut se remarier de son vivant. Il peut se convertir et souhaiter que vous reveniez. Par conséquent, vous n'êtes pas autorisé à épouser quelqu'un d'autre. Si vous épousez un autre homme, vous serez considéré comme un adultère devant Dieu.  **\n Romains 7 verset 2 à 3  **\n2 Car la femme qui a un mari est liée par la loi à son mari tant qu'il vit; mais si le mari est mort, elle est déliée de la loi de son mari.\n3 Ainsi donc, si, du vivant de son mari, elle est mariée à un autre homme, elle sera appelée adultère ; mais si son mari est mort, elle est libre de cette loi ; de sorte qu'elle n'est pas adultère, bien qu'elle soit mariée à un autre homme.  **\nCela signifie qu'au moment où une femme mariée se convertit, elle doit quitter le second mariage et retourner auprès de son mari afin qu'elle ne soit plus adultère. Ainsi, elle peut revenir comme l'a fait le fils prodigue. Il a dit que je retournerai vers mon père et confesserai que j'ai péché contre Dieu et contre lui. En conséquence, le mari ne doit pas se remarier si sa femme le quitte.  **\nDe même, comme le fils prodigue dans un pays lointain, le mari peut rencontrer Dieu et retourner auprès de sa femme. Elle ne doit pas se marier mais rester séparée selon la Parole de Dieu. La réconciliation peut ou non être possible. Le croyant doit rester célibataire pour servir le Seigneur selon sa volonté et sa grâce.\nCe sont les commandements de Dieu pour les maris et les femmes dans les cas où l'un est croyant et l'autre non. Mari, aime ta femme, et femme, obéis à ton mari en toutes choses.    **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 6  **\nDÉMONSTRATIONS PRATIQUES DE LA FEMME COMME SERVIETTE ET DU MARI COMME MAÎTRE  **\nSarah a appelé Abraham seigneur et maître. Il y a une relation de serviteur à maître entre la femme et le mari. Christ a pris la forme d'un serviteur pour faire la volonté de Son Père, le chef de la Trinité  **\nPhilippiens 2 verset 7  **\n7 Mais s'est fait sans réputation, et a pris sur lui la forme d'un serviteur, et a été fait à la ressemblance des hommes  **\nLa femme doit également prendre la forme d'une servante pour lui permettre de servir son mari et de faire sa volonté avec joie. De même, Christ est le chef de l'homme, mais pour les servir et les sauver du péché et de Satan, Il s'est fait serviteur des hommes.  **\nJean 13 verset 12 à 15  **\n12 Ainsi, après qu'il leur eut lavé les pieds, et qu'il eut pris ses vêtements, et qu'il se fut de nouveau assis, il leur dit   Savez-vous ce que je vous ai fait ?\n13Vous m'appelez Maître et Seigneur, et vous dites du bien; car je le suis.\n14 Si donc moi, votre Seigneur et Maître, je vous ai lavé les pieds, vous aussi vous devez vous laver les pieds les uns les autres.\n15 Car je vous ai donné un exemple, afin que vous fassiez comme je vous ai fait.  **\nDe même, le mari est le maître de sa femme mais doit démontrer une vie d'humilité et de servitude semblable à celle de Christ devant sa femme pour la sauver des habitudes pécheresses et de la désobéissance.  **\n6.1. LE SERVITEUR LEADERSHIP DU MARI  **\nLe mari est serviteur de Christ et maître de sa femme. En tant que serviteur de Christ, il doit obéir au commandement de Christ envers sa femme.\nIl y a des attributs de justice pour un maître serviteur qui vit en paix et en harmonie avec sa femme et arrive au ciel.  **\n6.1.1. SACRIFICE  **\nMatthieu 20 verset 28  **\n28 De même que le Fils de l'homme est venu, non pour être servi, mais pour servir et donner sa vie en rançon pour plusieurs.  **\nChrist est venu pour servir, pour donner sa vie en rançon, en payant le sacrifice ultime de nos péchés. Pour être le Sauveur du monde, il s'est livré volontairement, endurant la croix jusqu'à la mort. Pour que l'homme soit le sauveur de la famille, il doit être prêt à se donner entièrement à sa femme et à sa famille.  **\nIl est de votre responsabilité en tant qu'homme de subvenir aux besoins de la maison. Ne pas le faire vous rend désobéissant à Christ, votre Maître.  **\nPremier Timothée 5 verset 8  **\n8 Mais si quelqu'un ne pourvoit pas aux siens, et surtout à ceux de sa propre maison, il a renié la foi, et il est pire qu'un infidèle.  **\nDonnez-vous joyeusement à votre femme et à vos enfants en subvenant à leurs besoins que vous soyez assistée ou non, même si les bonnes épouses soutiennent volontiers leur mari dans les affaires familiales. Vous devez faire cela, que votre femme vous apprécie ou non, qu'elle soit croyante ou non. Bien qu'elle puisse ne pas être disponible pour vous quand vous le souhaitez, en raison du péché dans sa vie, si vous ne vous donnez pas entièrement à elle et à la famille, cela affectera votre position devant le Seigneur.  **\n6.1.2. SOYEZ SÉCURISÉ DANS VOTRE POSTE  **\nVous êtes le chef de la femme, comme Christ est votre chef. Pensez-vous que Christ doute de sa position ?  **\nJean 13 verset 3  **\n3 Jésus, sachant que le Père avait tout remis entre ses mains, qu'il était venu de Dieu et qu'il était allé à Dieu.  **\nJésus savait qui il était et était suffisamment en sécurité pour laver les pieds de ses disciples. Il n'a pas vu l'action comme le réduisant à leurs yeux. Au lieu de cela, ce fut une action glorieuse digne de leurs louanges. L'homme est la tête comme ordonné par Dieu. Personne ne peut enlever cela, et personne ne peut le changer. Même si votre femme vous provoque verbalement ou par ses actes, n'allez pas charnellement prouver que vous êtes le chef. Vous êtes le chef; soyez en sécurité et confiant en cela.    **\n6.1.3. SACHEZ OÙ VOUS ALLEZ  **\nJésus savait où il allait et l'a communiqué à l'église. Il a fixé une direction devant l'église, qui était le ciel. Il leur a promis la vie éternelle s'ils le servaient jusqu'à la fin. Soyez visionnaire. Dirigez en sachant où vous allez et attendez-vous à ce que votre femme et votre famille suivent sans manquer d'étapes. Demandez à Dieu de vous aider.  **\nProverbes 29 verset 14  **\n14 Le roi qui juge fidèlement les pauvres, son trône sera affermi pour toujours.  **\nQuelle vision avez-vous de vous-même, de votre femme et de votre famille ? Quelle vision avez-vous de l'avenir qui puisse donner de l'espoir à votre famille ? Avez-vous une? Communiquez-vous la vision? Christ a prêché l'évangile et a promis la vie éternelle.  **\nPremier Jean 2 verset 25  **\n25Et c'est ici la promesse qu'il nous a faite, la vie eternelle.  **\nLes promesses, l'espérance et la confiance de la vie éternelle nous incitent à suivre le Christ, à le rechercher davantage et à demeurer en lui. Quelles raisons donnez-vous à votre femme et à votre famille pour vous suivre, pour vous obéir comme l'exige la Parole de Dieu ? Mettre le ciel devant eux. Promettez-leur votre engagement pour leur bien.  **\n6.1.4. MENER PAR L'EXEMPLE  **\nJean 13 verset 15 à 17  **\n15Car je vous ai donné un exemple, afin que vous fassiez comme je vous ai fait.\n16 En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, le serviteur n'est pas plus grand que son maître ; ni celui qui est envoyé plus grand que celui qui l'a envoyé.\n17 Si vous savez ces choses, heureux êtes-vous si vous les faites.  **\nJésus a conduit par l'exemple. Il a démontré un leadership de serviteur à ses disciples en leur lavant les pieds. Êtes-vous l'homme qui dit  \"Faites ce que je dis, pas ce que je fais?\" Si vous voulez qu'elle vous respecte, montrez-lui du respect. Si vous voulez que vos enfants vous respectent, respectez-les. Si vous ne voulez pas qu'ils soient impolis envers vous ou les autres, ne le soyez pas envers eux. C'est aussi simple que ça!   **\n6.1.5. AMOUR INCONDITIONNEL, JUSQU'À LA FIN  **\nFaites-vous partie de ceux qui n'aiment que les bons moments ? Quand la vie est belle, vous aimez votre femme ; quand la vie est terrible, vous ne le faites pas. Jésus a aimé inconditionnellement jusqu'à la fin.  **\nJean 13 verset 1 à 2  **\nOr, avant la fête de la Pâque, lorsque Jésus sut que son heure était venue de passer de ce monde au Père, ayant aimé les siens qui étaient dans le monde, il les aima jusqu'à la fin.  **\nJésus avait été trahi et était sur le point d'être crucifié. Pourtant, Il a aimé jusqu'à la fin. Cela inclut Judas Iscariot, qui L'a trahi. Quand votre femme fait quelque chose de mal ou commet une erreur, l'aimez-vous toujours ? Verbaliser sa colère en disant   « Je te déteste, je ne t'aime plus ou je n'aurais jamais dû t'épouser », n'est pas le reflet de l'amour. Christ a aimé jusqu'à la fin ! Tu dois faire la même chose.  **\n6.2. QUEL EST L'ORDRE DU SEIGNEUR AUX SERVITEURS ?  **\nColossiens 3 verset 18 à 25  **\n18 Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme il convient dans le Seigneur. 19 Maris, aimez vos femmes et ne soyez pas amers contre elles.\n20 Enfants, obéissez en toutes choses à vos parents, car cela est agréable au Seigneur.\n21 Pères, n'irritez pas vos enfants, de peur qu'ils ne se découragent. 22Serviteurs, obéissez en toutes choses à vos maîtres selon la chair; pas avec un service oculaire, comme des hommes-plaisirs; mais dans la simplicité de cœur, craignant Dieu ;\n23Et quoi que vous fassiez, faites-le de bon coeur, comme pour le Seigneur, et non pour des hommes;\n24 Sachant que vous recevrez du Seigneur la récompense de l'héritage, car vous servez le Seigneur Christ.\n25Mais celui qui fait le mal recevra pour le mal qu'il a fait , et il n'y a pas d'estime pour les personnes.  **\nMari, aime ta femme même si ta femme est une pécheresse. Ne sois pas amer envers elle. Vous devez travailler sur votre cœur à ce sujet.  **\n6.3. LA FEMME COMME SERVIETTE DE SON MARI  **\nSarah a appelé son mari seigneur. Vous êtes une fille de Sarah, en toute humilité si vous agissez comme elle. Comment vous évaluez-vous maintenant ? Serviteurs, obéissez en toutes choses à votre maître selon la chair. Vous n'avez pas à discriminer. Votre maître ne connaît peut-être pas encore Christ. Vous devez obéir au commandement de Dieu d'obéir à votre maître en tant que serviteur. Votre mari n'est peut-être pas en Christ, mais il est votre mari; il est votre maître (Sarah a appelé Abraham maître). Obéissez comme Dieu l'ordonne. C'est la bonne chose à faire. Et Dieu sera glorifié.  **\n6.3.1. VIVRE AVEC LUI, PAS AVEC EYESERVICE.  **\nQue Dieu sache aussi que vous aimez votre mari. On a raconté l'histoire d'un homme méchant qui est mort dans une communauté, et un homme de cette communauté ne dirait du mal d'aucun homme ; il ne parlerait que du bien. Mais tous les gens de la communauté savaient que cet homme qui est décédé était méchant. Lorsque le bonhomme est venu à la maison endeuillée, il a été mis au défi de parler de l'homme mort. « Toi qui ne dis du mal d'aucun homme, que dis-tu de cet homme ? Il vint et examina le mort ; sa bouche était ouverte. L'homme a alors dit  \"Cet homme a de belles dents.\"  **\nIl y a beaucoup de bonnes choses que votre mari a faites et vous fait. Dites aux gens ces bonnes choses à son sujet. Remerciez Dieu pour ces bonnes choses en lui.  **\n6.3.2. AMOUR AVEC SIMPLE CŒUR  **\nEn tant qu'épouse, il doit y avoir quelque chose que vous pouvez aimer, peu importe à quel point votre mari est méchant. Fixez vos yeux sur ce qui est bon et consolez-vous. Priez que Dieu vous donne le cœur d'aimer votre mari. Vaincre ses maux, sa haine et ses maux par l'amour, qui couvre une multitude de péchés. Vous pouvez y parvenir par la prière et la pratique.  **\nPremier Pierre 4 verset 8  **\n8 Et par-dessus tout, ayez entre vous une fervente charité, car la charité couvrira la multitude des péchés.  **\nVotre mari peut passer des nuits à l'extérieur. Oui, ce n'est pas bien, mais s'il vous nourrit et vous habille, fixez vos yeux sur le bien qu'il fait en vous fournissant de la nourriture et des vêtements. Sa méchanceté n'est pas à cent pour cent, soit dit en passant ! Aimez avec unicité de cœur.  **\n6.3.3. FAIRE LUI COMME AU SEIGNEUR  **\nFaites tout ce que vous devez faire pour votre mari comme pour le Seigneur. Bien qu'il ne le mérite pas, Dieu le mérite. Faites-le lui, pour l'amour de Dieu. Faites savoir à Dieu que vous êtes juste, et Il vous récompensera.  **\nJe connais une femme, une employée du gouvernement, dont le mari l'a abandonnée. Il a abandonné le mariage pour épouser une autre femme, laissant la femme et leurs enfants pendant environ douze ans. Alors le mari rencontra Jésus, se repentit, renvoya la seconde femme et retourna vers sa femme. Il s'agenouilla devant sa femme et demanda pardon. Dieu merci, le mari est revenu après douze ans et a trouvé la femme toujours fidèle à Dieu et à lui.  **\n6.3.4. SACHEZ QUE DIEU VOUS RÉCOMPENSERA.  **\nDieu vous récompensera, vous restaurera et vous rachètera lorsque vous ferez le bien.  **\n1 Corinthiens 10 verset 13  **\n13Il ne vous a été tenté que ce qui est commun à l'homme, mais Dieu est fidèle, qui ne permettra pas que vous soyez tentés au-delà de votre capacité; mais avec la tentation, vous préparerez aussi un moyen d'échapper, afin que vous puissiez la supporter.  **\nAussi dur que puisse être l'incroyant, quoique enfant de Satan, Dieu vous fera vaincre dans cette maison. Pourquoi? Vous êtes avec Dieu et ses promesses doivent s'accomplir dans votre vie. Il sait diviser les eaux de la mer Rouge pour que vous les traversiez. Mais donnez-Lui la justice, la vérité, la sainteté, l'engagement, la servitude et l'amour, et vous verrez ce qu'Il fera. Votre cas sera différent. Vous serez à l'intérieur du feu mais vous vous sentirez détendu. Le Fils de Dieu sera avec vous dans le feu. Vous serez dans la fosse aux lions, mais le Seigneur scellera leur bouche contre vous pour sa louange et sa gloire et votre promotion aux yeux des hommes.  **\n 6.4. LE PARTENAIRE DE MARIAGE IMPIE  **\nFaites à votre mari, le pécheur, comme Dieu dit que vous devriez lui faire. Faites à votre femme, la pécheresse, comme Dieu dit que vous devriez lui faire. Vous verrez Dieu avec vous et vous arriverez au ciel quand vous le ferez.  **\nActes 4 verset 18 à 20  **\n18 Et ils les appelèrent, et leur recommandèrent de ne point parler ni enseigner au nom de Jésus.\n19 Mais Pierre et Jean répondirent et leur dirent   S'il est juste aux yeux de Dieu de vous écouter plus que Dieu, jugez-vous.\n20 Car nous ne pouvons que dire les choses que nous avons vues et entendues.  **\nVoici une femme devant un incroyant autoritaire semblable à un lion, un mari dont la voix libère la peur de Satan. « Je t'avais dit de ne plus aller dans cette église. Si vous le faites, je m'occuperai de vous. Chaque fois que je te verrai y aller, tu verras ce que je ferai ! Oubliez cette voix et parlez comme Pierre et Jean l'ont fait. « Dieu m'a créé et m'a amené à vous. Si tu ne veux pas de moi, je vais à lui. Votre méchanceté ne m'enverra pas en enfer. J'irai à l'église dans cette maison parce que je sers Dieu, qui m'a créé. Tu n'es pas mon créateur !\"  **\nN'ayez pas peur, et Dieu prendra soin de votre relation. Vous n'êtes pas l'esclave de votre mari. Vous n'êtes pas obligée de marcher nue dans la rue parce que votre mari le dit. Vous n'êtes pas obligée de mettre un pantalon parce que votre mari le dit. Vous irez en enfer ! Vous vous tiendrez devant Dieu et lui direz qui est le plus grand   votre mari ou lui ? Qui a la charge de votre vie éternelle ? Votre mari vous a épousée dans la chair; il n'a pas épousé votre âme.  **\nEzéchiel 18 verset 4  **\n4 Voici, toutes les âmes sont à moi; comme l'âme du père, ainsi aussi l'âme du fils est à moi, l'âme qui pèche, elle mourra.  **\nDevriez-vous pécher et désobéir à Dieu à cause de votre mari ? Alors vous avez perdu le ciel. Toi aussi, tu es devenu incroyant ! Vous vous disqualifiez du ciel en désobéissant à Dieu en faisant de votre mari votre dieu. Les épouses chrétiennes ne doivent pas faire attention aux menaces de leur mari de peur qu'il ne devienne une idole pour elles pour provoquer la jalousie, la colère et le jugement de Dieu.\nLes trois enfants hébreux dirent au roi Nebucadnetsar   « Ô roi, nous ne te parlerons pas avec prudence ou honneur à ce sujet. Si vous dites que vous nous jetez au feu, notre Dieu nous délivrera. Nous sommes prêts à mourir s'il ne le fait pas, mais nous n'adorerons pas ton image. Femme, dis ça à ton mari.  **\nSi votre mari veut que vous accomplissiez des actes sexuels pécheurs comme le sexe anal, dites à votre mari le but de votre anus. Dites-lui que c'est un port de sortie uniquement pour évacuer les excréments, et qu'il n'est pas autorisé à y insérer sa virilité. Ce n'est pas pour cela que Dieu vous a envoyé dans sa maison. Si vous n'êtes pas prêt, je me fermerai; c'est tout ce qu'il y a à faire. Il peut dire   « Je vais te quitter pour quelqu'un d'autre. \"Allez vers d'autres qui sont prêts à périr avec vous. Mais pas moi.\" Parlez avec audace en tant qu'enfant de Dieu que vous êtes. Les justes sont audacieux comme le lion.   **\nEt toi homme, ne sois pas l'esclave d'une femme. « Ma femme a dit avant de se donner à moi, je ne dois pas aller à l'église. Ma femme a dit avant ceci et cela. N'avez-vous pas appris d'Adam, qui a mangé le fruit de sa femme, et tous deux sont devenus nus ? Écoutez-vous une femme incrédule, obéissant à ses ordres ? Elle décide quand vous devriez lire la Bible et quand ne pas le faire ; quand aller à l'église et quand ne pas aller ; quand servir Dieu et quand ne pas le faire ; quand voyager pour une conférence et quand ne pas le faire. Vous avez quitté le chemin ! C'est ce que cela signifie. Répondez-lui hardiment ; répondez hardiment à votre conjoint incrédule. C'est toi le chef, pas elle. C'est vous qui contrôlez, pas elle. Vous ne la respecterez pas dans de telles affaires.  **\n 6.5. APPRENEZ D'ABIGAIL, LA FEMME DE NABAL  **\nPremier Samuel 25 verset 14 à 23, 32 à 35, 37 à 38  **\n14 Mais l'un des jeunes hommes parla à Abigaïl, femme de Nabal, en disant   Voici, David a envoyé des messagers du désert pour saluer notre maître ; et il s'en est pris à eux. 15 Mais les hommes ont été très bons envers nous, et nous n'avons pas été blessés, et nous n'avons rien manqué, tant que nous étions à l'aise avec eux, quand nous étions dans les champs ;\n16Ils étaient pour nous une muraille de jour comme de nuit, pendant tout le temps que nous étions avec eux à garder les brebis. 17Maintenant donc, sache et considère ce que tu feras; car le mal est déterminé contre notre maître et contre toute sa maison, car il est tellement fils de Bélial qu'on ne peut lui parler.\n18 Alors Abigaïl se hâta de prendre deux cents pains, et deux outres de vin, et cinq moutons tout préparés, et cinq mesures de blé grillé, et cent grappes de raisins secs, et deux cents gâteaux de figues, et les posa sur des ânes. . 19 Et elle dit à ses serviteurs   Passez devant moi ; voici, je viens après toi. Mais elle n'en a rien dit à son mari, Nabal.\n20 Et il arriva, comme elle montait sur l'âne, qu'elle descendit par le couvert sur la colline, et voici, David et ses hommes descendirent contre elle ; et elle les a rencontrés. 21 Or David avait dit   Assurément, c'est en vain que j'ai gardé tout ce que cet homme a dans le désert, de sorte que rien n'a été perdu de tout ce qui lui appartenait et il m'a rendu le mal pour le bien.\n22 Ainsi et plus encore Dieu fait aux ennemis de David, si je laisse de tout ce qui lui appartient à la lumière du matin quelqu'un qui pisse contre le mur.\n23 Et quand Abigaïl vit David, elle se hâta d'abattre l'âne, et tomba face contre terre devant David, et se prosterna à terre,…\n32 Et David dit à Abigaïl   Béni soit le Seigneur, le Dieu d'Israël, qui t'a envoyé aujourd'hui à ma rencontre ; 33 Et béni soit ton conseil, et béni sois-tu, qui m'as empêché aujourd'hui de venir verser le sang et de me venger de ma propre main.\n34 Car en effet, aussi vivant que soit le Seigneur, le Dieu d'Israël, qui m'a empêché de te faire du mal, si tu ne t'étais précipité et ne venais à ma rencontre, certainement il n'était resté à Nabal, à la lumière du matin, personne qui pisse contre le mur.\n35 Alors David reçut de sa main ce qu'elle lui avait apporté, et lui dit   Monte en paix dans ta maison ; vois, j'ai écouté ta voix, et j'ai accepté ta personne…\n37 Mais il arriva, le matin, quand le vin fut sorti de Nabal, et que sa femme lui eut dit ces choses, que son cœur mourut en lui, et il devint comme une pierre. 38 Et il arriva environ dix jours après que l'Éternel frappa Nabal, qui mourut.  **\nQuelle était l'histoire? Dans le désert, David protégea les brebis de Nabal ; il a ordonné à ses hommes de ne pas toucher les moutons de Nabal. Généralement, dans le désert, les gens pillent les bergeries. Mais à cause de David et de ses hommes autour d'eux, les voleurs avaient peur de piller les moutons de Nabal. Un moment est venu où Nabal a célébré la fin de l'année, offrant des cadeaux et remerciant les personnes qu'il aimait. Il appela tous ses bergers à manger et à se réjouir. David envoya aussi des hommes à Nabal pour lui demander quelque chose à manger.  **\nNabal a refusé et a dit du mal de David. Quand David en a entendu parler, il était furieux et a décidé de détruire Nabal et tout ce qu'il avait. La décision de David a atteint Abigail. Elle ne savait pas que David avait demandé à son mari de les aider dans le désert. Qu'a-t-elle fait? A-t-elle attendu l'autorisation ? Est-elle allée voir le mari pour lui dire que je voulais apaiser David ? Cela aurait été un non-sens pour le Nabal. Il n'aurait pas écouté, et encore moins répondu gentiment à cela. Cela aurait été un problème, mais cela était nécessaire pour la justice et la paix. Abigail a fait ce qui était juste pour se sauver, son mari et sa famille.  **\nC'est une leçon pour les femmes qui peuvent se trouver dans des situations similaires. Vous ne devez pas tout dire à votre mari, surtout quand vous savez qu'il est un homme méchant, insensé et impie. Pourquoi devez-vous dire à votre mari avant de donner vos dîmes ou avant de soutenir la cause de Christ ? Cela signifie-t-il que vous ne pouvez pas pratiquer la justice à moins que votre mari ne le permette ? Abigaïl a pratiqué la justice, et cette justice a sauvé sa vie et sa famille. Lorsqu'elle vint plus tard expliquer ce qui s'était passé pour amener son mari au repentir, elle tendit au contraire à sa mort, récompense de sa méchanceté.\nQue dit la Bible sur le fait de ne pas faire ce que vous savez que vous devez faire ? Refuser de faire le bien ou de sauver une vie quand on peut être un péché.  **\nJacques 4 verset 17  **\n17C'est pourquoi, pour celui qui sait faire le bien et ne le fait pas, c'est un peche.  **\nNe vous cachez pas derrière votre mari et ne devenez pas improductif. Parce que votre homme ne servira pas Dieu, ne craindra pas Dieu, ni ne sera charitable envers Lui, ce n'est pas une excuse pour que vous fassiez la même chose. Vous devez utiliser la sagesse pour servir Dieu dans la justice. Abigaïl était une femme juste qui obéissait à son mari malgré sa méchanceté.\nLorsque le Seigneur vous conduit à pratiquer la justice, et que vous savez que vous ne le faites pas par orgueil, et que vous ne gaspillez pas les ressources familiales, allez-y, faites-le et rendez gloire à Dieu. Lorsque vous le ferez, vous vous sauverez, vous, vos enfants et tous ceux de votre foyer. Ce n'est pas un péché de faire le bien dirigé par Dieu.  **\n6.6. APPRENDRE D'OBADIAH  **\n Premiers Rois 18 versets 1 à 13  **\n1 Et il arriva, après plusieurs jours, que la parole de l'Éternel fut adressée à Élie la troisième année, disant   Va, montre-toi à Achab ; et j'enverrai la pluie sur la terre. 2 Et Élie alla se montrer à Achab. Et il y eut une grande famine à Samarie. 3 Et Achab appela Abdias, qui était le gouverneur de sa maison. (Or Abdias craignait beaucoup l'Éternel; 4 car il arriva que lorsque Jézabel retrancha les prophètes de l'Éternel, Abdias prit cent prophètes, les cacha par cinquante dans une caverne et les nourrit de pain et d'eau.)\n5 Et Achab dit à Abdias   Va dans le pays, vers toutes les sources d'eau et vers tous les ruisseaux, peut-être trouverons-nous de l'herbe pour sauver les chevaux et les mulets, afin que nous ne perdions pas toutes les bêtes.\n6 Ils se partagèrent donc le pays pour le traverser. Achab s'en alla seul dans un sens, et Abdias s'en alla seul dans un autre sens.\n7Et comme Abdias etait en chemin, voici, Elie le rencontra, et il le reconnut, et tomba sur sa face, et dit  Es-tu ce mon seigneur Elie? 8 Et il lui répondit   Je le suis ; va, dis à ton seigneur   Voici, Elie est ici.\n9Et il dit  Qu'ai-je peche, pour que tu aies livre ton serviteur entre les mains d'Achab, pour qu'il me tue? 10 Aussi vivant que soit l'Eternel, ton Dieu, il n'y a ni nation ni royaume où mon seigneur n'ait envoyé pour te chercher; et quand ils dirent   Il n'est pas là ; il a fait jurer au royaume et à la nation qu'ils ne t'ont pas trouvé. 11 Et maintenant tu dis   Va, dis à ton seigneur   Voici, Élie est ici.\n12 Et il arrivera, dès que je serai parti loin de toi, que l'Esprit du Seigneur te conduira où je ne sais pas ; et ainsi, quand je viendrai le dire à Achab, et qu'il ne te trouvera pas, il me tuera, mais moi, ton serviteur, je crains le Seigneur depuis ma jeunesse.\n13 N'a-t-on pas dit à mon seigneur ce que j'ai fait quand Jézabel a tué les prophètes de l'Éternel, comment j'ai caché cent hommes des prophètes de l'Éternel par cinquante dans une grotte, et les ai nourris de pain et d'eau ?  **\nAbdias était un homme juste, servant dans le gouvernement d'Achab et de Jézabel. Comme une femme est la servante de son mari, ainsi Abdias l'était pour son maître Achab. Mais Achab était méchant. Il a commencé à tuer les prophètes du Seigneur. Abdias a-t-il obtenu de lui la permission de cacher certains prophètes ? Lui aussi aurait pu être tué s'il l'avait osé. Il cacha cent prophètes et les nourrit chaque jour de nourriture et d'eau.  **\nD'où obtenait-il la nourriture ? Cela aurait pu venir du gouvernement parce qu'il était sous le gouvernement d'Achab. Cela aurait pu provenir de ses ressources. Mais il faisait cela sous le gouvernement d'Achab, un gouvernement injuste, pollué et impie. Néanmoins, Abdias a pratiqué la sainteté, la justice et la charité.  **\nVous pouvez servir dans un environnement impie et être toujours pieux. Même lorsque les conditions sont contraires, vous pouvez faire le bien.  **\n6.7. QUE FAIRE LORSQUE VOTRE PARTENAIRE EST IMPIE  **\n6.7.1. DEMANDEZ DE L'AIDE  **\nSi vous êtes marié à un partenaire impie, cela ne devrait pas vous empêcher d'être une bénédiction pour les gens, l'église et votre communauté. Être marié à un partenaire impie ne devrait pas vous rendre stérile en ce qui concerne les bonnes œuvres. Si vous avez un conjoint qui ne vous le permettra pas, s'il vous plaît, demandez de l'aide à Dieu, et Il vous donnera faveur, sagesse et conseil.  **\nTa justice te fera toujours vaincre. Même quand c'est risqué, le pouvoir de la justice en vous triomphera ; vous servirez le Seigneur avec succès dans la sagesse et l'audace même avec un conjoint impie.  **\n6.7.2. DEMANDEZ GRACE  **\nQui est cette personne qui a épousé un incroyant et qui a réussi ? Ce n'est pas par la force ou le pouvoir, seulement par Dieu. Demandez la grâce de Dieu pour vous aider si vous avez un conjoint incroyant.  **\n2 Corinthiens 12 verset 8, 9  **\n8Pour cette chose, j'ai supplié le Seigneur trois fois, afin qu'elle s'éloigne de moi.\n9Et il me dit  Ma grace te suffit, car ma force s'accomplit dans la faiblesse. C'est pourquoi je me glorifierai plutôt volontiers de mes infirmités, afin que la puissance de Christ repose sur moi.  **\nBeaucoup souhaitent que leurs conjoints soient partis ou morts   « J'attends que tu meures ; Je vais épouser une autre femme. La femme dit aussi   « Je veux que tu meures pour pouvoir épouser un autre homme. Souhaiter la mort de quelqu'un est mal, alors ne le faites pas. Ne souhaite pas de mal à quelqu'un.\nQue devrais tu faire? Sa grâce te suffit. La grâce du Seigneur est ce dont vous avez besoin. Si vous avez un conjoint incroyant, demandez la grâce.  **\nHébreux 4 verset 15 à 16  **\n15 Car nous n'avons pas de souverain sacrificateur qui ne puisse être touché par le sentiment de nos infirmités ; mais nous avons été tentés en tous points comme nous, mais sans péché.\n16 Approchons-nous donc avec assurance du trône de la grâce, afin d'obtenir miséricorde et de trouver grâce pour être secourus en cas de besoin.  **\nAllez à Dieu et demandez la grâce si votre conjoint est un incroyant afin que vous n'irez pas en enfer. Si votre force est défaillante, la grâce de Dieu est la seule solution. Priez et demandez de l'aide à Dieu. Sa grâce est suffisante.   **\n6.7.3. VIVRE UNE VIE DE PRIÈRE  **\nVous devez vivre une vie de prière. Prenez la prière car la personne atteinte de diabète prend des médicaments pour survivre. Prenez la prière comme les hypertendus prennent des médicaments pour contrôler leur tension artérielle. Priez jour et nuit pour pouvoir vaincre ces démons, pour les soumettre, pour pouvoir amener les anges à venir vous aider dans cet environnement hostile.  **\n6.7.4. DEMANDEZ LA SAGESSE  **\nDemandez la sagesse de Dieu pour vous permettre de vivre avec un conjoint incroyant. La Bible nous dit les parties vitales de la sagesse.  **\nDeuxième Chroniques 1 verset 10  **\n10 Donne-moi maintenant la sagesse et la connaissance, afin que j'aille et que j'entre devant ce peuple, car qui peut juger ton peuple, qui est si grand ?  **\nDonne-moi la sagesse afin que je sache comment sortir et entrer avec cette femme ou cet homme. Comment pouvez-vous vivre avec une personne aussi mauvaise, si ce n'est par sagesse ? Demandez la sagesse.  **\nProverbes 4 verset 5 à 13  **\n5 Obtenez la sagesse, obtenez la compréhension   ne l'oubliez pas ; ni déclin des paroles de ma bouche. 6 Ne l'abandonne pas, et elle te gardera; aime-la, et elle te gardera.\n7 La sagesse est la chose principale; par conséquent, acquiert la sagesse, et avec tout ce que tu obtiens, acquiers l'intelligence. 8 Exalte-la, et elle te fera grandir, elle t'honorera, quand tu l'embrasseras.\n9 Elle donnera à ta tête un ornement de grâce; elle te remettra une couronne de gloire. 10 Écoute, ô mon fils, et reçois mes paroles; et les années de ta vie seront nombreuses.\n11 Je t'ai enseigné dans la voie de la sagesse; Je t'ai conduit dans de bons chemins. 12 Quand tu iras, tes pas ne se redresseront pas; et quand tu cours, tu ne trébucheras pas.\n13 Accrochez-vous à l'instruction ; qu'elle n'aille pas la garder; car elle est ta vie.  **\nObtenez la sagesse; demande-le. Salomon a prié pour que la sagesse administrative l'aide à savoir comment diriger les gens. Vous aussi, vous avez besoin de sagesse pour vivre avec votre conjoint. Le Dieu du ciel vous aidera; Dieu vous accordera grâce et sagesse.  **\n\n\n\nPARTIE III  **\nL'OBEISSANCE ET LA SAGESSE POUR LA SAINTETE DANS LE MARIAGE ET LA VIE FAMILIALE  **\n\nCHAPITRE 7  **\nDIEU EXIGE L'OBEISSANCE A SA PAROLE  **\nL'Écriture ci-dessous nous dit que Dieu attend la perfection dans la vie de ses enfants. Faites toutes choses bien, ne laissez pas la souillure dans votre vie, votre marche avec Dieu et votre discours. Ne laissez pas des mensonges ou des mots abusifs ou corrompus sortir de votre bouche. Marchez dans la voie de Dieu. Marchez dans la Parole de Dieu. Vous serez bénis lorsque vous garderez les témoignages de Dieu, lorsque vous garderez les commandements de Dieu et lorsque vous deviendrez un témoignage pour les autres afin de promouvoir le nom du Seigneur.  **\nPsaumes 119 verset 1 à 6  **\n1 Heureux ceux qui ne sont pas souillés dans le chemin, qui marchent dans la loi du Seigneur.\n2Heureux ceux qui gardent ses temoignages et qui le cherchent de tout leur coeur.\n3Ils ne commettent pas non plus d'iniquité, ils marchent dans ses voies. 4Tu nous as commandé de garder tes préceptes avec diligence.\n5 Que mes voies aient été dirigées vers l'observance de tes statuts !\n6 Alors je n'aurai pas honte, quand j'aurai du respect pour tous tes commandements.  **\nDieu veut que vous le cherchiez de tout votre cœur. Ne cédez pas à la tentation. Soyez parfait dans votre relation conjugale, même si vous êtes marié à un incroyant. Même si vous êtes marié à un chrétien charnel, soyez parfait afin qu'il n'y ait pas de faute en vous. Eloignez de vous l'iniquité. Ne mentez pas et ne soyez pas injurieux. Que vos paroles soient justes. Marchez dans les voies de Dieu. Gardez la colère et la méchanceté loin de vous.  **\nDemandez l'aide de Dieu dans la prière pour refléter le Christ devant votre conjoint. Aussi, priez pour que vous obéissiez à la Parole de Dieu et que vous n'ayez pas honte devant ceux à qui vous professez votre foi.\nObéissez à la parole, aux commandements de Dieu concernant le mariage. La sagesse est nécessaire lorsque les choses ne coulent pas librement à cause de circonstances contraires.  **\nVous pouvez rencontrer des obstacles qui peuvent vous obliger à vouloir compromettre votre sainteté et votre droiture dans votre mariage. Appliquez la sagesse de Dieu pour vous permettre de sauter par-dessus ou de contourner ces obstacles. L'obéissance et la sagesse vous feront vivre la vie sainte et juste dans votre mariage que Dieu attend de vous. Il s'attend à ce que vous soyez parfait et saint dans le mariage et la vie de famille.  **\n7.1. À QUI L'APÔTRE PAUL ÉCRIT-IL ?  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 2 à 27  **\n22 Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme au Seigneur. 23Car le mari est le chef de la femme, comme Christ est le chef de l'Eglise, et il est le sauveur du corps.\n24 C'est pourquoi, comme l'Église est soumise à Christ, ainsi les femmes le sont en toutes choses à leurs maris. 25 Maris, aimez vos femmes, comme Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle;\n26 afin qu'il la sanctifie et la purifie par le lavage d'eau par la parole, 27 afin qu'il se la présente comme une église glorieuse, sans tache, ni ride, ni rien de semblable; mais qu'il soit saint et sans défaut.  **\nÀ qui Paul écrivait-il dans ce livre ? Il nous raconte en  **\nEphésiens 1 verset 1 à 2  **\n1 Paul, apôtre de Jésus-Christ par la volonté de Dieu, aux saints qui sont à Éphèse et aux fidèles en Jésus-Christ ; 2 Grâce et paix vous soient accordées de la part de Dieu notre Père et de la part du Seigneur Jésus Christ.  **\nCette épître a été écrite aux saints (hommes et femmes) et aux croyants fidèles en Jésus-Christ. Paul leur donnait une instruction. Si vous êtes croyant, c'est ce que Dieu attend de vous en tant que femme ou homme marié   la fidélité.  **\nPaul n'écrit pas à des saints ordinaires mais à des saints fidèles qui ont accepté de suivre diligemment la Parole de Dieu. Il a dit  «Frère, je m'attends à cela dans votre maison, dans votre famille. Sœur, par votre confession et votre témoignage que vous êtes chrétienne, je m'attends à cela dans votre mariage et votre foyer.  **\n7.2. INSTRUCTIONS AUX FEMMES  **\n7.2.1. ÉPOUSES, SOUMETTEZ-VOUS À VOS MARI.  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 22  **\n22 Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme au Seigneur.  **\nFemmes, soumettez-vous à vos propres maris. Certaines épouses respectent les gens et traitent les autres hommes avec honneur et humilité. La Bible dit de faire la même chose à votre mari. Pourquoi aimez-vous les gens à l'extérieur plus que votre mari ? Pourquoi obéissez-vous plus aux gens de l'extérieur qu'à votre mari ? Pourquoi vous soumettez-vous au leadership   votre patron, même votre pasteur, plus que vous ne le faites à votre mari ? Pourquoi traitez-vous joyeusement, avec amour, avec vos voisins plus qu'avec votre mari ? Assurez-vous de vous soumettre à lui aussi et bien plus encore.  **\n 7.2.2. NE TARDEZ PAS L'OBEISSANCE A VOTRE MARI  **\nL'Écriture dit en outre que vous devez vous soumettre à votre mari comme au Seigneur comme si votre mari était le Seigneur Jésus-Christ lui-même. Comment auriez-vous traité Jésus si vous l'aviez vu physiquement ? Vous auriez été excité; vous ririez et voudriez vous agenouiller devant lui, le remercier, le bénir, obéir à chaque mot qu'il prononce et faire des promesses et des engagements. Par conséquent, faites-le à votre mari. Les saintes épouses ne doivent pas enfreindre les commandements de leurs maris tout comme elles n'enfreindront pas ceux de Jésus-Christ.  **\nPsaumes 119 verset 59 à 61  **\n59 J'ai réfléchi à mes voies et j'ai tourné mes pas vers tes témoignages. 60 Je me suis hâté et j'ai tardé à ne pas garder tes commandements.  **\nS'il vous plaît, ne tardez pas à tout ce qui concerne votre mari  obéissez-lui et soumettez-vous à lui.   **\n7.2.3. LAISSEZ VOTRE MARI ÊTRE VOTRE TÊTE  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 23  **\n23 Car le mari est le chef de la femme, comme Christ est le chef de l'Église, et il est le sauveur du corps.  **\nLaissez votre mari être votre chef. Lui permettre. Dieu le lui a donné parce qu'il est un homme. La direction ne vous est pas donnée parce que vous êtes une femme. Il n'y a pas d'autre qualification. Ce n'est pas parce qu'il est né de nouveau, instruit ou intelligent. Mais parce qu'il est un homme, il est automatiquement le chef du mariage et de la famille. Dieu l'a divinement décidé. Laisser votre mari être votre chef signifie que vous devez lui permettre de vous diriger, de vous commander, de vous réprimander et d'être l'autorité finale dans toutes les décisions de votre mariage. L'apôtre Paul écrit aux saints fidèles en Jésus-Christ, leur donnant ces règles. Si vous êtes une chrétienne mariée, cela s'applique également à vous. Dieu veut que vous soyez parfait. S'il vous plaît, ne laissez pas le désir de la chair vous faire désobéir aux instructions de Dieu. Cela reflétera l'injustice, l'impureté et l'impiété. Si vous permettez à l'argent, au confort de vous-même et à la fierté de la vie d'affecter cela, vous n'êtes pas fidèle en Jésus-Christ.  **\nSi l'argent, la chair et l'amour du monde sont les raisons pour lesquelles vous êtes infidèle dans votre vocation d'épouse, vous n'êtes pas fidèle en Jésus-Christ. Obéissez à votre mari en toutes choses et de toutes les manières légitimes.  **\n7.2.4. VOYEZ VOTRE MARI COMME L'ÉGLISE VOIT LE CHRIST DANS LA SOUMISSION, L'OBÉISSANCE ET L'AMOUR  **\nLe mari est le chef de la femme, tout comme Christ est le chef de l'Église. Personne ne rivalisera avec Christ en autorité. Personne ne lèvera jamais la tête comme s'il était le Christ dans l'Église. Personne ne prendra jamais la position de Christ.  ** \nPremier Pierre 5 verset 1 à 3  **\n1 J'exhorte les anciens qui sont parmi vous, qui sont aussi anciens et témoins des souffrances de Christ, et aussi participants à la gloire qui sera révélée;\n2 Faites paître le troupeau de Dieu qui est au milieu de vous, en en prenant la garde, non par contrainte, mais de bon gré ; pas pour un gain sale, mais d'un esprit prêt;\n3 Non pas comme maîtres de l'héritage de Dieu, mais comme modèles pour le troupeau.  **\nEn tant que ministres de l'évangile, nous donnons sa place à Christ. Il dicte nos voies. Nous cherchons avant tout à plaire à Jésus. Notre esprit est sur Jésus. Nous chantons ses louanges et l'apprécions. S'Il dit d'y aller, nous partons, et s'Il dit que nous restons en arrière, nous restons en arrière. Femme, laisse ton mari diriger. Ne dites pas du mal de votre mari à vos enfants. Parlez-leur toujours en bien de votre mari, leur père. L'amour couvre une multitude de péchés.  **\nNe succombez pas à la tentation car votre vie est plus que le mariage. Humiliez-vous dans le mariage afin que le mariage n'affecte pas votre âme et ne vous empêche pas d'aller au ciel. Soyez prudent avec votre mariage; sinon, vous serez disqualifié pour entrer au ciel.  **\nMarc 8 verset 36  **\n36 Car à quoi servira-t-il à un homme de gagner le monde entier et de perdre son âme ?  **\nQu'est-ce que cela profitera à une femme si elle gagne sa convenance, est grande dans le mariage, pense comme elle veut, est redoutée par l'homme et les enfants, et prend le siège de la seigneurie mais finit par aller en enfer ?  **\nQuel est l'avantage ? Voyez votre mari comme l'Église voit Christ dans la soumission et l'obéissance. Respectez, soumettez-vous, honorez-le et ne lui répondez pas. S'il vous plaît ne soyez pas impoli avec lui.\nSouvenez-vous que la Bible s'adresse à vous en tant que saint, fidèle en Jésus-Christ. Ainsi, la Bible ne s'attend pas à du péché dans votre vie ou votre mariage.  **\n7.2.5. VOYEZ VOTRE MARI COMME UN SAUVEUR, UN SOUTIEN ET UN FOURNISSEUR DE LA FAMILLE  **\nVoyez ce que dit l'Écriture aux versets 23 et 24. N'invoquons-nous pas le nom du Seigneur chaque fois que nous sommes dans le besoin ? Voyez votre mari sous le même jour. Ne vivez pas une vie d'indépendance. Voyez votre mari comme l'Église voit le Christ. Le Christ est le sauveur du corps. Quiconque invoquera le nom du Seigneur sera sauvé. Ne dépréciez pas votre mari en ne recherchant pas ses conseils ou ses instructions. Il est injuste de ne pas écouter ses contributions mais de faire ce que vous désirez.  **\nLorsque vous méprisez votre mari, c'est la preuve que vous ne vous soumettez pas à lui. Lorsque vous vous soumettez à votre mari et demandez de l'aide quand vous en avez besoin, même une aide financière, il vous en donnera volontiers. Soyez heureux de lui faire confiance et de l'honorer et attendez-vous à ce qu'il remplisse son rôle de mari, même s'il n'a pas à donner.  **\nVotre mari est le pourvoyeur. Tout ce que vous faites doit être sous ses instructions. Que votre conduite prouve que vous le reconnaissez comme le chef de la maison. Par exemple, ne diriez-vous pas à votre patron où vous vous trouvez en tant que travailleur ? Ne prendriez-vous pas la permission de votre patron pour vous absenter du travail en cas de besoin ? Ne lui feriez-vous pas rapport lorsque vous êtes malade ? Votre mari est le patron de votre maison. Pourquoi faites-vous des choses sans sa permission ? Pourquoi sortez-vous comme vous voulez, entrez comme vous voulez, sortez comme vous voulez et dites que je n'ai de compte à rendre à personne ? C'est impie. Si vous vivez ainsi, vous n'êtes pas fidèle en Jésus-Christ ; vous n'êtes pas le saint auquel cette écriture est écrite.  **\nSoumettez-vous en toutes choses. Un homme était en train de mourir. Il a appelé son fils unique et lui a dit   « J'ai réalisé toutes ces choses dans la vie   des bâtiments, des entreprises, des voitures, un directeur et de nombreux serviteurs. Mais vous n'allez prendre qu'une chose. Le reste ne vous appartiendra pas. tu prends?\" Sachant que le gérant connaît tout ce que le père possède et que le père possède même le gérant, il a dit   « Je prends votre gérant. C'est un sage. Si le manager est celui qui gère toutes les ressources, et que le manager est sous mes ordres, il supervisera les ressources pour moi comme si c'était pour vous. C'est la sagesse !  **\nVous possédez beaucoup de richesses personnelles, de ressources financières et matérielles, mais le Seigneur vous a placé sous un homme. Par conséquent, toute votre richesse lui appartient, votre mari.  **\n7.3. INSTRUCTIONS AUX MARI  **\nRappelez-vous, cette instruction s'adresse aux saints, qui sont fidèles en Jésus-Christ. L'apôtre parle, sachant que vous êtes un saint, pas seulement un saint de nom, mais un fidèle en Jésus-Christ. L'apôtre vous considère comme né de nouveau, un homme préservant sa foi et ne voulant pas avoir honte devant sa femme, de peur qu'elle ne dise   « Je pensais avoir épousé un chrétien. Le Seigneur attend de vous que vous soyez un homme qui s'efforce de préserver sa foi devant ses enfants, de peur qu'ils ne disent   « Je pensais que notre père était un vrai ministre de l'Évangile. Il veut que vous n'ayez pas honte devant votre voisin s'il vous entend crier, crier et aboyer comme un chien la nuit. Ministre, votre maison doit être comme le dit l'Écriture ; votre mariage devrait être comme le dit l'Écriture. Les versets qui contiennent l'instruction pour les hommes qui sont fidèles en Christ sont     **\nEphésiens 5 verset 25 à 27  **\n25 Maris, aimez vos femmes, comme Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle;\n26 Afin qu'il la sanctifie et la purifie par le lavage d'eau par la parole,\n27 Afin qu'il se la présente comme une église glorieuse, sans tache, ni ride, ni rien de semblable; mais qu'il soit saint et sans défaut.\n7.3.1. AIMEZ VOTRE FEMME  **\nOuvrez votre cœur à votre femme. Apprenez à sourire et à rire joyeusement avec votre femme. Apprenez à être joyeux en sa présence. Chérissez votre femme. Profitez toujours de la compagnie de votre femme.  **\nCela va au-delà de cela - Aimez votre femme comme le Christ aime aussi l'Église. N'aimez pas dans le domaine de l'homme naturel. Allez dans le royaume de Christ. Christ aimait l'Église. Comment a-t-il aimé l'Église?  **\n1 Corinthiens 13 versets 4 à 6  **\n4 La charité souffre longtemps et est bonne; la charité n'est pas envieuse ; la charité ne se vante pas, ne s'enfle pas,\n5 Ne se comporte pas de manière inconvenante, ne cherche pas ses propres intérêts, n'est pas facilement provoqué, ne pense pas au mal ;\n6 Ne se réjouit pas dans l'iniquité, mais se réjouit dans la vérité ;  **\n\n7.3.2. SOYEZ PATIENT AVEC VOTRE FEMME  **\nLa charité signifie ici l'amour. L'amour est patient. Soyez patient avec votre femme. Ne soyez pas rapidement provoqué. Ne lui parlez pas durement. Pourquoi voulez-vous faire savoir à votre femme que vous êtes un prétendant ? Si vous dites des mots durs ou des mots abusifs à chaque erreur, cela montre que votre profession de chrétienté a été fausse. Quand vous lui souriez plus tard, elle appellera ça le sourire d'un hypocrite. Apprenez à être patient avec votre femme.  **\n7.3.3. SOYEZ GENTIL AVEC VOTRE FEMME  **\nL'amour est gentil. Etre gentil. Offrez de bons cadeaux à votre femme. Parlez-lui gentiment. Soyez doux et tendre. Même quand elle fait du mal, s'il vous plaît, répondez doucement et doucement pour détourner le mal.  **\n7.3.4. NE PAS ENVIER NI CONCURRENDRE VOTRE FEMME  **\nLa charité ne fait pas envie. N'enviez pas la position de votre femme au cas où Dieu la bénisse plus financièrement. L'argent revient à toute la famille. Toutes les fenêtres d'une pièce sont ouvertes pour laisser entrer l'air. Ainsi, elle est une fenêtre par laquelle l'air entre dans la maison. Cela devrait être une bénédiction. Si votre femme est dans une meilleure position ou qualification qui bénira la famille, cela signifie plus de revenus et d'honneur pour la famille. Pourquoi devriez-vous être envieux? Si votre femme a un talent qui est une bénédiction pour la maison, pourquoi l'enviez-vous ? Aimez votre femme, ne l'enviez pas.  **\n7.3.5. NE VOUS VANTEZ PAS ET NE SOYEZ PAS FIER DE VOTRE FEMME  **\nLe verset ci-dessus continue en disant que la charité ne se vante pas, n'est pas orgueilleuse et ne se vante pas. Pourquoi dites-vous   « Je dois montrer à cette femme que je suis plus grand qu'elle ; je suis ceci ou cela ? Jésus nous a-t-il montré que nous ne sommes rien ? Ne savons-nous pas qu'il est tout ? Pourquoi votre femme devrait-elle être asservie à cause de vous ? Vous dites que je suis grand; Je suis l'homme; je suis le chef. Et alors? Votre femme devrait-elle vous voir comme un terroriste dans la maison ? Cela devrait-il la soumettre à la servitude? Cela devrait-il faire d'elle une deuxième classe dans votre maison ?  **\nNe soyez pas vantard. Ne vous vantez pas de vos talents. Le Seigneur se vante-t-il devant l'Église ? Au lieu de cela, Il dit   \"Ce que j'ai est à toi, tout ce que mon Père a est à toi, tout ce que j'ai acquis est à toi. Il y a encore plus de richesses que tu n'as pas vues. Il y a encore plus de richesses qui t'attendent.\" Alors, fais comprendre à ta femme que tout ce que tu auras dans la vie est à elle.  **\n7.3.6. NE SOYEZ PAS INATTENDU ET FOLLE  **\nLa charité ne se comporte pas de façon inconvenante. Pourquoi vous conduisez-vous mal comme un imbécile? Pourquoi avez-vous versé de l'eau sur votre femme parce qu'elle a fait une erreur ? Pourquoi avez-vous battu votre femme ou l'avez-vous jetée à terre ? C'est de la folie. Vous perdez votre respect en faisant cela. Votre comportement montre à quel point vous êtes irrévérencieux. Elle pensait que vous étiez un homme de sagesse, mais elle voit de la folie en vous. Une petite folie chez un homme estimé être un homme de sagesse le transforme en fou. Alors, ne vous comportez pas bêtement.  **\n7.3.7. NE SOYEZ PAS ÉGÔTE AVEC VOTRE FEMME  **\nL'amour ne cherche pas le sien. Tu es sorti, tu as acheté de la viande rôtie et tu t'es assis dans le salon, le mangeant seul. Vous n'avez pas donné votre femme ou vos enfants. Si ce que vous mangez est bon, c'est aussi bon pour votre femme. Faites ce qui donne de la joie et de la satisfaction à votre femme comme Christ le ferait pour l'Église.   **\nIl y a certaines choses que les gens naturels ne peuvent pas faire à cause de la loi du péché, de la puissance du péché dans le monde et de la nature du péché en eux. Ils ne peuvent pas le surmonter. Mais vous pouvez vaincre parce que vous êtes un vainqueur par Jésus-Christ et que vous êtes fidèle en Jésus-Christ. Faites plus que ne font vos voisins. Faites plus que ne font vos frères biologiques. Allez au-delà de ce que votre père, qui n'est pas né de nouveau, a fait. Votre père n'était pas un saint fidèle, alors ne copiez pas ce que votre père a fait ; aller au-delà de ça.  **\n7.3.8. NE SOYEZ PAS RAPIDE A VOUS METTRE EN COLERE CONTRE VOTRE FEMME  **\nL'amour ne se provoque pas facilement. La colère détruit un mariage. Un homme qui est esclave de la colère ne devrait pas être pasteur. Un évêque ne doit pas être prompt à se fâcher. La Bible dit de ne pas se lier d'amitié avec un homme en colère.  **\nProverbes 22 verset 24  **\n24 Ne te lie pas d'amitié avec un homme en colère; et avec un homme furieux tu n'iras pas  **\nMalheur à la vie de celle qui a épousé un homme en colère. Sa vie sera dure. Son rire et son sourire seront hypocrites   faits uniquement pour plaire à l'homme en colère. Elle se couvrira toujours pour cacher la douleur, la peur et le chagrin.  **\nConnaissez-vous le type de peur que la colère communique ? Voyez-vous la chaîne qu'un homme en colère tient ? Pouvez-vous percevoir le degré de peur qu'un chien fou enchaîné peut encore communiquer ? Même si vous savez que le chien est enchaîné, vous passez toujours à côté de lui avec une grande peur. Vous pouvez décider de ne pas passer par le chien enchaîné, mais de passer par un autre chemin ou de vous retirer complètement. C'est ainsi qu'un homme en colère a fait vivre sa famille avec lui. Il faut noter que les femmes peuvent aussi être en colère.  **\nLa Parole dit que si vous êtes un homme en colère, vous n'êtes pas digne d'avoir une femme. Il serait préférable d'être seul car vous dérangeriez et incommoderiez votre femme. Vous ne lui permettrez pas de se tromper comme tout le monde ; vous n'accepterez pas une simple erreur comme ajouter trop de sel à la nourriture. Éloignez cette colère de votre vie. Apportez-le à Dieu dans la prière. Pleure contre ça.  **\nL'amour ne se provoque pas facilement. Lorsque votre femme fait ou dit quelque chose de mal, faites de la place pour apprendre. Personne n'est parfait. Votre maison sera fantastique si vous faites de la place pour que les gens apprennent de leurs erreurs au lieu d'être rapidement provoqués à chaque fois.   **\nNaturellement, lorsque votre femme commettra une erreur, elle sera troublée et se demandera  \"Que vais-je dire à cet homme? Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé. Le vent est venu et a soufflé cela. Mais si je lui dis, il ne sera pas d'accord et dire que je l'ai fait.\" Maintenant, imaginez quand vous rentrez à la maison et qu'elle vous raconte ce qui s'est passé, et que vous dites simplement   « Tout va bien », et même si elle va bien, elle se réjouira dans son cœur, rendant grâce à Dieu pour un mari merveilleux. Ne soyez donc pas si prompt à vous mettre en colère.  **\n7.3.9. NE SOYEZ PAS MAL À VOTRE FEMME  **\nL'amour ne pense pas au mal. Travaillez-le dans votre cœur. Les actions viennent des pensées. Tel qu'un homme pense, est-il ainsi ? Le mal commence par une pensée. La pensée produit la force d'action. Par conséquent, éliminez les mauvaises pensées de votre esprit si vous ne voulez pas agir de manière impie. Rejetez ces mauvaises pensées que vous avez envers votre femme immédiatement après leur venue. Continuez à balayer votre esprit, afin que ces mauvaises pensées ne s'installent pas contre elle. Si votre femme a une tare ou une infirmité dans son corps physique, ne vous y préoccupez pas. L'amour ne se réjouit pas de l'iniquité. Ne vous réjouissez pas lorsque votre femme est malade en disant   « Tu penses que tu peux tout faire. Maintenant tu es impuissant et malade ; tant mieux pour toi ! Lorsque de telles pensées envahissent votre esprit, expulsez-les. Ne permettez pas à votre femme de s'apercevoir que vous vous réjouissez de sa chute. Ne la laissez pas vous voir amusé ou content d'un accident dans sa famille. C'est le cœur d'un démon. Aimez votre femme comme le Christ aime aussi l'Église.  **\n7.3.10. PORTEZ VOTRE FEMME ET CROYEZ-LA  **\nApprenez à tout supporter. Apprenez à croire ce que dit votre femme. Ayez bon espoir de la voir grandir et s'améliorer dans de nombreux domaines. Endurez toutes choses. Endurez même si elle peut être rebelle. C'est l'amour. Et tu dois aimer ta femme comme le Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle.  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 25 à 27  **\n25 Maris, aimez vos femmes, comme Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle;\n26 afin qu'il la sanctifie et la purifie par le lavage d'eau par la parole, 27 afin qu'il se la présente comme une église glorieuse, sans tache, ni ride, ni rien de semblable; mais qu'il soit saint et sans défaut.  **\n7.3.11. DONNEZ-VOUS À VOTRE FEMME COMME LE CHRIST S'EST DONNÉ À L'ÉGLISE  **\nDonnez-vous aux soins de votre femme comme le Christ s'est donné aux soins de l'Église. Donnez-vous; ne soyez pas nonchalant. Consacrez du temps à votre femme comme Christ l'a également consacré à l'Église ; cela Lui a coûté. Il s'est donné pour le monde afin qu'ils fassent partie de l'Église lorsqu'ils croient en lui. Lorsqu'il s'est donné pour l'Église qui est maintenant devenue son épouse, c'était afin qu'il puisse la sanctifier et la purifier par le lavage d'eau par la Parole.  **\nMaris, aimez-vous en vous donnant pour la perfectionner. Apprenez à enseigner à votre femme les connaissances essentielles. Apprenez à votre femme à faire d'elle ce que vous voulez. Vous pouvez inviter un professionnel pour lui apprendre à cuisiner. Si votre femme ne parle pas bien l'anglais ou votre langue, vous pouvez employer quelqu'un pour lui enseigner à la maison afin d'améliorer son niveau d'alphabétisation. Vous pouvez l'envoyer à l'école pour l'améliorer. De telles actions améliorent et augmentent sa dignité pour votre joie et votre satisfaction.  **\nPurifiez-la avec les mots justes comme Christ purifie l'Église. Cette eau est la Parole de Dieu. Utilisez la Parole de Dieu sur votre femme.  **\n2 Timothée 3 verset 15 à 17  **\n15 Et que, dès ton enfance, tu connais les saintes écritures, qui peuvent te rendre sage à salut par la foi qui est en Jésus-Christ.\n16 Toute Ecriture est inspirée de Dieu, et utile pour enseigner, pour convaincre, pour corriger, pour instruire dans la justice;\n17 Afin que l'homme de Dieu soit parfait, entièrement pourvu à toutes les bonnes œuvres.  **\nApprenez à utiliser les Ecritures sur votre femme. Réprimandez-la avec des écritures dans les domaines de sa faute. Ouvrez-lui les yeux sur les Écritures pour lui faire savoir qu'elle a tort. Corrigez-la avec la Parole de Dieu. Faites-lui savoir ce que la Bible dit de ses actions. Selon les Écritures, instruis-la dans toutes les affaires de justice pour faire d'elle une personne parfaite. Utilisez des mots pour perfectionner votre femme. Parlez   ne vous taisez pas. Pourquoi gardes-tu le silence sur ses nombreuses erreurs ? Expliquez-lui le mal qu'elle fait, appuyé par les Écritures.  **\nCela s'applique également à une chrétienne, une femme née de nouveau, une sainte et fidèle en Jésus-Christ. A ceux-là, dit la Bible, conseillez un homme sage, et il deviendra plus sage.   **\nProverbes 1 verset 5  **\n5 L'homme sage entendra et augmentera sa science; et un homme intelligent parviendra à de sages conseils  **\nCe n'est pas pour une femme dans la chair, une femme charnelle, ou une femme qui est une pécheresse. Reprenez pas un imbécile de peur qu'il ne vous déteste. Une femme qui n'aime pas le Seigneur Jésus et n'est pas prête à se soumettre à la Parole de Dieu méprisera la correction.  **\nProverbes 9 verset 8  **\n8 Ne reprends pas un moqueur, de peur qu'il ne te haïsse; reprends un sage, et il t'aimera.  **\nUne femme à la recherche de la perfection pour le ciel ne voudra pas vivre dans le péché en tant qu'incroyante dans le mariage. Vous ne cherchez pas la perfection ? Voulez-vous manquer le paradis?  **\nLe Seigneur a dit à votre mari de faire comme le Christ a fait à l'Église en utilisant les Écritures de sagesse, de connaissance et de compréhension pour vous perfectionner en vous donnant des réprimandes, des corrections et des instructions scripturaires. Mais vous dites   « Je n'ai pas besoin de votre correction ; Je n'ai pas besoin de vos instructions ; arrête de crier après moi. Comment, alors, pouvez-vous être parfait ?  **\nL'homme fait cela pour vous présenter à lui-même, la femme de sa vision, comme le Christ l'a fait à l'Église, pour se la présenter sainte et sans tache. Cet homme vous apprend à vivre d'une manière qui le rendrait heureux avec vous, comment il peut jouer joyeusement avec vous, comment il vous récompensera joyeusement et comment il se vantera de vous comme sa femme devant les autres. Vous dites non?  **\nLe roi Assuérus voulait que Vashti vienne devant le peuple, pour leur faire savoir combien il avait investi en elle pour sa gloire. Si un homme veut se vanter de sa femme aux autres, il doit la perfectionner selon la vérité scripturaire. Votre mari fait tout pour vous perfectionner, se vanter de vous et rendre témoignage de vous. Pourquoi, alors, résistez-vous à l'instruction, à la réprimande et à la correction ?  **\nComme un homme sage sait qu'il n'en sait pas assez, devenez une femme sage et comprenez que vous n'avez pas assez appris pour recevoir davantage. Votre mari vous instruit tout comme Christ enseigne l'Église. Comment? Par le lavage d'eau pour la purifier par la Parole, pour la présenter à Lui-même, une église glorieuse qui n'a ni tache ni ride, ni quoi que ce soit de semblable, mais qui doit être sainte et sans défaut.    **\nCela signifie que vous n'êtes pas parfait. Bien que marié depuis de nombreuses années, vous n'êtes pas encore parfait. Vous devez mieux connaître l'homme; vous devez connaître ses goûts et ses dégoûts. Et ceux-ci, vous ne pouvez pas les connaître en un jour. Même si vous les lisez dans un livre, vous les oublierez et vous aurez besoin de vous les rappeler à plusieurs reprises. Par conséquent, soyez humble pour recevoir des instructions.  **\nJésus a dit que si je ne vous lave pas les pieds, vous ne m'appartenez pas. Permettez à votre mari de faire ce qu'il est responsable de faire pour vous présenter à lui-même, la femme avec laquelle il aime vivre. Ne le frustrez pas. Au lieu de vivre avec lui avec de la poussière sur les pieds, permettez-lui de vous laver les pieds. Ne dormez pas à côté de lui avec de la poussière sur les pieds. Ne vous comportez pas comme Pierre, qui a refusé qu'on lui lave les pieds.  **\n« Si je ne te lave pas, si je ne te corrige pas, si je ne te reprends pas, tu ne seras pas l'homme de ma vision ; tu n'as rien à voir avec ma vie », une paraphrase des paroles de Jésus à Pierre.  **\nCe sont les instructions que Dieu donne à l'homme (mari)   obéir, se présenter une femme glorieuse.  **\n\nCHAPITRE 8  **\nRAISONS DE LA DESOBEISSANCE A DIEU DANS LE MARIAGE  **\nL'obéissance est requise pour les femmes et les maris chrétiens afin de garder leur mariage et leur famille justes. Pensez-vous qu'il est difficile pour un mari de manquer le paradis à cause de sa femme ? Pensez-vous qu'il est difficile pour une femme de manquer le paradis à cause de son mari ? Votre mariage est-il un marché où Satan vient vendre ses biens ? Avec son pouvoir, il peut garder le couple à contrecœur toute la semaine, mais le dimanche matin, ils vont à l'église. Est-ce ce que Satan fait chez vous ? Alors vous n'êtes pas des saints ; vous n'êtes pas fidèle en Jésus-Christ. Vous n'êtes pas en route pour le ciel et votre mariage est misérable. Il vaut mieux que vous n'ayez jamais été marié que marié, et vous irez en enfer.  **\nLe Seigneur recherche la perfection. Quand Adam a dit   « La femme que tu m'as donnée m'a servi le fruit comme nourriture à manger », Dieu l'a-t-il gardé dans le jardin ? Cette excuse était vraie, mais cela n'a pas empêché Dieu de bannir Adam du Jardin. Ne vous excusez pas à cause de votre femme. Cela ne vous donnera pas le paradis. Quand la femme a dit   « C'est le serpent qui m'a donné à manger », cela l'a-t-il dispensée du jugement ? Vos excuses, aussi sincères soient-elles, ne vous excluront pas de l'enfer. Ils vous emmèneront en enfer. Alors, s'il vous plaît, décidez de vous rendre au paradis puisque vous êtes déjà marié. Asseyez-vous, comptez le coût et tenez-vous-y pour que vous puissiez faire le paradis. Vous n'avez pas besoin d'être consolé dans votre péché. Dieu n'aura pas pitié d'un pécheur ou d'un rétrograde et ne lui donnera pas le paradis.   **\n8.1. RAISONS DE LA DESOBEISSANCE A DIEU  **\n8.1.1. PÉCHÉ ET CARNALITÉ CHEZ L'UN DES PARTENAIRES  **\nEphésiens 1 verset 1, 2  **\n1 Paul, apôtre de Jésus-Christ par la volonté de Dieu, aux saints qui sont à Éphèse et aux fidèles en Jésus-Christ ; 2 Grâce et paix vous soient accordées de la part de Dieu notre Père et de la part du Seigneur Jésus Christ.  **\nIl y a des gens à qui cette épître n'est pas écrite. Qui sont ces gens? Ceux qui ne sont pas saints, ceux qui ne sont pas fidèles en Jésus-Christ. La grâce est donnée à ceux qui sont déjà en Jésus-Christ. La grâce n'est pas donnée à ceux qui ne sont pas en Christ pour les aider à pratiquer la Parole de Dieu jusqu'à ce qu'ils naissent de nouveau. Vous attisez les flammes sous une marmite où un feu brûle déjà pour augmenter son intensité, mais qu'est-ce que vous attisez quand il n'y a pas de feu sous la marmite ? Se marier en dehors de la volonté de Dieu est le début du chagrin car votre conjoint ne pourra pas recevoir ni garder les instructions divines de Dieu sur le mariage. Ce sera comme conduire une voiture avec des pneus dégonflés. Vous aurez du mal à déplacer le véhicule. Le Seigneur commande à ses enfants de ne pas être sous un joug inégal avec les incroyants.  **\n deuxième Corinthiens 6 verset 14  **\n14 Ne soyez-vous pas sous un joug inégal avec les non-croyants, car quelle relation y a-t-il entre la justice et l'injustice ? Et quelle communion a la lumière avec les ténèbres ?  **\nQu'en est-il des chrétiens qui épousent des personnes qui prétendent être nées de nouveau mais qui ne le sont pas ? En utilisant l'analogie du feu et du pot, ils n'ont pas de feu sous leur pot et, par conséquent, aucune grâce pour un mariage réussi. Enfant de Dieu, si tu penses au paradis et que tu veux faire le paradis, assure-toi d'épouser un chrétien fidèle. Demandez de l'aide à Dieu. Ne laissez rien ni personne vous précipiter dans le mariage.   **\nQu'en est-il de ceux qui sont déjà mariés et mariés en Christ ? C'est une bonne chose. Mais si on recule, ça devient terrible. Une fois qu'ils rétrogradent, ils perdent la crainte de Dieu et peut-être l'amour pour leur conjoint. Leurs pensées peuvent devenir vengeresses et méchantes. Ils pourraient embarrasser leur conjoint ou les conduire au péché. Par conséquent, veillez à ne pas faire rétrograder votre conjoint. Si vous le faites, vous récolterez des résultats terribles en conséquence.  **\nLorsqu'une personne dans le mariage est un incroyant et que vous êtes le croyant, la vie peut être difficile, mais souvenez-vous de la Parole de Dieu   vous devez être parfait et saint. La norme ne change pas si vous êtes marié à un incroyant. Satan est dans le monde, mais certains vivent dans la justice et la sainteté par la grâce de Dieu. Il s'attend à ce que vous recherchiez son aide si vous avez un tel cas. Si l'un des conjoints n'est pas entièrement engagé envers Dieu, l'autre souffrira beaucoup de choses. « Non engagé » signifie que la chair est entrée et que la chair a pris le dessus, même si le foyer est considéré comme un foyer chrétien. Il y aura des problèmes parce que le partenaire charnel ne peut pas couler dans la droiture.  **\nAttention à ne pas faire rétrograder votre partenaire. Votre punition sera trop grande pour vous, comme l'a dit Caïn. De même, la récompense sera trop grande au-dessus de tout ce que vous appréciez dans votre état rétrograde. Promouvoir la justice dans le mariage. Encouragez votre conjoint à rester juste pour votre bien. Passez du temps à prier pour que votre conjoint reste fidèle en Jésus-Christ.  **\n8.1.2. MANQUE DE PRIERE  **\nLe manque de prière signifie un manque de carburant pour votre moteur spirituel pour conduire votre vie chrétienne. L'instruction de Jésus dans le cadre de la prière du Seigneur dit   « Quand vous priez, dites   Donnez-nous aujourd'hui notre pain quotidien. Parmi de nombreux avantages, la prière nous permet de vivre avec succès au-dessus du péché. Mais lorsque nous arrêtons de prier, nous devenons vulnérables au diable et à nos anciennes habitudes pécheresses. Notre vantardise du péché et de Satan cessera à mesure que la prière cessera.  **\nJean 14 verset 30  **\n30 Désormais, je ne parlerai plus beaucoup avec vous, car le prince de ce monde vient, et il n'a rien en moi.  **\nSatan viendra sûrement et ne cessera jamais de venir. La grâce reçue par la prière empêche Satan de voir des défauts en vous. Vous perdrez votre capacité à résister à la tentation que Satan apportera à votre conjoint si vous ne priez plus. L'esprit charnel ne comprend pas les choses de Dieu parce qu'elles sont spirituellement discernées. Les prières vous donneront la grâce de comprendre et de surmonter les tentations de Satan à travers votre conjoint.    **\n1 Corinthiens 2 verset 14  **\n14 Mais l'homme naturel ne reçoit pas les choses de l'Esprit de Dieu, car elles sont une folie pour lui et il ne peut pas les connaître, parce qu'elles sont spirituellement discernées.  **\nLorsque vous interprétez mal les choses parce que votre spiritualité est en panne, chaque petit mot prononcé par votre partenaire vous mettra en colère. C'est parce que votre vie de prière n'est plus dynamique. Veillez et priez pour ne pas tomber en tentation.  **\nMatthieu 26 verset 41  **\n41 Veillez et priez, afin que vous n'entriez pas en tentation, l'esprit est bien disposé, mais la chair est faible.  **\nParce que vous ne priez plus, la luxure apparaîtra. D'autres femmes deviendront plus attirantes que votre femme. Vous les désirerez. Des pensées lubriques qui n'ont jamais existé prendront le dessus sur votre esprit. La bonne qui a longtemps travaillé pour votre ménage sans que vous y pensiez ou que vous la désiriez deviendra soudainement attirante. Vous n'aurez plus la grâce de surmonter ces pensées parce que votre vie de prière est en panne.  **\nL'absence de prière peut également rendre la femme colérique et facilement irritable; toutes sortes de péchés dans lesquels elle a vécu commenceront à jaillir. Les faiblesses de votre conjoint, que vous aviez appris à ignorer, pourraient bientôt redevenir un problème. Encouragez-vous les uns les autres à prier et apprenez à prier ensemble. Si votre vie de prière diminue, arrêtez-la rapidement. Criez au Seigneur; ne permettez pas au diable qui venait et ne trouvait rien à vous accuser, de venir maintenant voir quelque chose dans votre vie auquel s'accrocher, pour ruiner votre mariage.  **\n8.1.3. SUIVRE UN MAUVAIS CONSEIL.  **\nUn mauvais conseil est comme un objet étranger dans son corps. Pensez à une tache ou un grain entrant dans votre œil. Si cela se produit, l'œil clignotera naturellement, perdant sa capacité à voir les choses confortablement ou clairement pendant un moment. Un mauvais conseil affecte immédiatement la justice au foyer. Vous commencez à vous comporter comme un œil qui clignote ; un moment, tu es juste, l'autre, tu es en bas. Apportez chaque conseil que vous recevez à Dieu dans la prière pour sa confirmation ou son rejet.   **\n8.1.4. SUIVRE LA MAUVAISE ENTREPRISE.  **\nNaturellement, la mauvaise communication corrompt les bonnes manières.  ** \n1 Corinthiens 15 verset 33  **\n33 Ne vous y trompez pas, les mauvaises communications corrompent les bonnes manières.\nSuivre ou apprendre de la mauvaise entreprise vous corrompra. Amnon était un ami de Jonadab. Jonadab a donné un mauvais conseil. Amnon a commis un inceste avec sa sœur Tamar. Il a finalement été tué par les mauvais conseils qu'il a reçus.  **\ndeuxième Samuel 13 verset 3 à 14  **\n3Mais Amnon avait un ami qui s'appelait Jonadab, fils du frère de Shimeah David, et Jonadab était un homme très rusé.\n4 Et il lui dit   Pourquoi, étant fils du roi, maigris-tu de jour en jour ? Ne me le diras-tu pas ? Et Amnon lui dit   J'aime Tamar, la soeur de mon frère Absalom.\n5 Et Jonadab lui dit   Couche-toi sur ton lit et fais-toi malade, et quand ton père viendra te voir, dis-lui   Je te prie, laisse ma sœur Tamar venir, et me donner de la viande, et habiller le viande sous mes yeux, afin que je la voie et que je la mange de sa main.\n6 Alors Amnon se coucha et se rendit malade et lorsque le roi fut venu le voir, Amnon dit au roi   Je te prie, laisse Tamar ma sœur venir, et me faire deux gâteaux devant moi, afin que je puisse manger dans sa main.\n7 Alors David envoya chez lui vers Tamar, disant   Va maintenant dans la maison de ton frère Amnon, et prépare-lui de la viande. 8 Alors Tamar se rendit dans la maison de son frère Amnon ; et il fut couché. Et elle prit de la farine, et la pétrit, et fit des gâteaux à ses yeux, et fit cuire les gâteaux. 9 Et elle prit une casserole, et les versa devant lui ; mais il a refusé de manger. Et Amnon dit   Faites sortir tous les hommes de moi. Et ils sortirent chacun de lui. 10 Et Amnon dit à Tamar   Amène la viande dans la chambre, que je mange de ta main. Et Tamar prit les gâteaux qu'elle avait faits, et les apporta dans la chambre à Amnon, son frère. 11 Et quand elle les lui eut amenés à manger, il la saisit et lui dit   Viens coucher avec moi, ma sœur.\n12 Et elle lui répondit   Non, mon frère, ne me force pas ; car rien de tel ne doit se faire en Israël, ne fais pas cette folie.\n13 Et moi, où irai-je ma honte ? et toi, tu seras comme l'un des insensés d'Israël. Maintenant donc, je te prie, parle au roi ; car il ne me retiendra pas de toi. 14 Cependant il ne voulut pas écouter sa voix mais, étant plus fort qu'elle, la força et coucha avec elle.  **\nÉvitez la compagnie de ceux qui peuvent vous entraîner dans le péché ; qu'ils soient vos amis ou vos relations.\nAlors, comment un couple chrétien peut-il rester obéissant à Dieu et apprécier le mariage ? Le Seigneur Jésus dit   **\nMatthieu 5 verset 48  **\n48 Soyez donc parfaits, comme votre Père qui est dans les cieux est parfait.  **\nPar conséquent, le couple doit viser la perfection. Leur engagement devrait être d'abord envers Dieu et Sa Parole. Dans un mariage chrétien, lorsque les parties impliquées s'engagent à la Parole de Dieu en tant qu'individus, leur mariage réussira. Faites en sorte que votre mariage réussisse grâce à une vie d'obéissance, de droiture et de sainteté.  **\nCHAPITRE 9  **\nSAGESSE ET PRUDENCE POUR MAINTENIR LA JUSTICE DANS LE MARIAGE  **\nLa sagesse pose la question   que dois-je faire, étant donné que mon partenaire n'est pas juste, n'est pas né de nouveau, est charnel, est dans la chair, ne craint pas Dieu et ne gardera pas ses commandements ? Comment est-ce que je joue mon rôle dans la justice ? Voici quelques choses que vous devriez faire    **\n9.1. DEMANDEZ TOUJOURS À DIEU  **\n Chercher Le visage de Dieu dans tous les domaines. Les hommes doivent toujours prier et ne pas s'évanouir.  **\nLuc 18 verset 1  **\n1 Et il leur dit une parabole à cette fin, que les hommes doivent toujours prier et ne pas défaillir ;  **\nSoyez priant dans votre mariage pour toujours savoir quoi faire.  **\nJacques 1 verset 4 à 5  **\n4 Mais que la patience ait son œuvre parfaite, afin que vous soyez parfaits et entiers, ne manquant de rien.\n5 Si l'un de vous manque de sagesse, qu'il la demande à Dieu, qui donne à tous simplement et sans reproche; et il lui sera donné.  **\nPour être parfait, entier et ne manquer de rien, vous devez être patient avec l'autre, quoi qu'il fasse. Contrôlez-vous et vos émotions. Refusez de fixer votre esprit, vos yeux et votre cœur sur le mal.  **\nDemandez à Dieu si vous manquez de sagesse pour répondre à votre mari ou comment traiter votre femme. Demandez toujours à Dieu quoi faire et comment le faire face à un partenaire incroyant ou rétrograde. Demandez de l'aide à Dieu. Si vous devez corriger votre conjoint, recevez la grâce de Dieu pour le faire correctement. Rappelez-vous que Dieu est toujours prêt à vous aider dans les moments difficiles. Il comprend ce que vous traversez et ne manquera pas de vous aider lorsque vous allez vers Lui dans la prière  **\n9.2. SUIVEZ TOUJOURS LES ÉCRITURES DANS VOTRE RELATION  **\nAssurez-vous que tout ce que vous faites est scripturaire. C'est là que se trouve votre confort. C'est aussi là que se trouvent votre sagesse et votre victoire.  **\nRomains 15 verset 4  **\n4 Car tout ce qui a été écrit auparavant l'a été pour notre instruction, afin que nous ayons l'espérance, par la patience et la consolation des Écritures.\nDécidez d'agir uniquement selon les Écritures, car vous trouverez dans les Écritures réconfort, force, paix et soutien. Si vous obéissez aux Écritures, tout abus qui en résultera sera considéré comme une persécution et votre conscience ne sera pas coupable devant Dieu. Il vaut mieux que votre conjoint soit offensé que Dieu ; Dieu devrait être en paix avec vous plus qu'un sur terre parce qu'il est le propriétaire de votre vie et le juge de tous.  **\nÉvitez de vous engager dans des activités qui sont clairement contraires aux Écritures. Rappelez-vous, pour l'amour du ciel, vous devez être parfait dans vos relations avec votre conjoint, car l'enlèvement ne donnera à personne le temps de faire les choses avant qu'elles ne soient prises. L'enlèvement se produira soudainement et selon le temps de Dieu, pas le vôtre ou celui de votre famille. Pas quand votre conjoint peut maintenant vous laisser faire tout ou partie des choses pieuses, qu'il vous avait empêché de faire dans le passé. Vous devez rester parfait.  **\nSi le conjoint croyant est finalement expulsé de son domicile conjugal, il ne devrait pas être surpris ; c'est scripturaire. La Bible dit que vous serez persécutés et chassés de la synagogue. Le conjoint rejeté devrait être réconforté en étant renvoyé de chez lui à cause de la persécution, et non à cause de son péché. Dieu prendra soin d'eux. David exprime sa dépendance à l'égard de Dieu dans les mots ci-dessous    **\nPsaume 27 verset 10  **\n10 Quand mon père et ma mère m'abandonneront, alors le Seigneur me relèvera.  **\nIl savait que Dieu l'aiderait et le soutiendrait sans aucun doute si toute autre aide échouait.  **\n9.3. CHERCHEZ CONSEIL AUPRÈS DES JUSTES ET DES SAINTS  **\nDieu donne aux prédicateurs justes la sagesse de vous conseiller pour une vie sainte. Demandez conseil aux justes et aux saints afin que vous sachiez précisément quelle est la pensée de Dieu. Salomon, le professeur, a dit    **\nProverbes 15 verset 22  **\n22 Sans conseil, les desseins sont déçus, mais dans la multitude de conseillers ils sont établis.  **\nIl est nécessaire de demander conseil à des personnes expérimentées dans les questions importantes. Laissez la Parole du Christ habiter en vous richement en toute sagesse.  **\nColossiens 3 verset 16  **\n16 Que la parole de Christ habite en vous richement en toute sagesse ; enseignez-vous et exhortez-vous les uns les autres par des psaumes, des hymnes et des chants spirituels, chantant avec grâce dans vos cœurs pour le Seigneur.  **\nAppliquez toujours la sagesse à la Parole de Dieu. Le counseling vous aidera à faire face avec sagesse aux situations pratiques de la vie. Ne soyez pas indépendant ; apprenez à consulter car, généralement, il y a plus de perspicacité de la part de plusieurs personnes que d'une seule personne.  **\nLe sage Salomon nous dit   « Deux valent mieux qu'un, ils ont une meilleure récompense pour leur travail » (Eccl. 4 verset 9). Par conséquent, obtenir des yeux divins pour voir avec vous ou des cerveaux divins pour raisonner avec vous vous amènera certainement à prendre la bonne décision qui contribuera grandement à aider votre mariage.   **\n9.4. INFORMATIONS LIMITES  **\nParce que votre conjoint n'est pas né de nouveau, apprenez à contrôler les informations que vous partagez avec lui.  **\n Michée 7 verset 5, 6  **\n5 Ne vous fiez pas à un ami, ne vous fiez pas à un guide, gardez les portes de votre bouche loin de celle qui repose dans votre sein. 6 Car le fils déshonore son père, la fille s'élève contre sa mère, la belle-fille contre sa belle-mère, les ennemis de l'homme sont les gens de sa maison.  **\nIl y a la vérité et il y a la sagesse. La vérité est éternelle et la sagesse lubrifie la vérité afin que la vérité puisse être mise en pratique sans causer de préjudice. Cela aiderait si vous agissiez sur la vérité, mais vous avez besoin de la sagesse pour lubrifier cette vérité pour la faire bouger paisiblement et en douceur. Comme Abigaïl (dans 1er Samuel 25), sachez quand il convient ou non de parler, de partager des informations sensibles avec votre conjoint. Quand elle a vu que Nabal, son mari était ivre, elle a attendu le matin où il serait sobre pour lui parler. Alors apprenez à restreindre et à contrôler ce que vous dites à votre conjoint incrédule ou rétrograde.  **\n9.5. SOYEZ AIMANT ET BIENVEILLANT  **\nSoyez aimant et attentionné car cela guérit. Aimez vos ennemis. Vous pourriez, par amour, convertir vos ennemis.  **\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 1 à 2  **\n1 De même, femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris ; que, si quelqu'un n'obéit pas à la parole, il peut aussi, sans la parole, être gagné par la conversation des épouses ; 2 Pendant qu'ils contemplent ta conversation chaste accompagnée de peur.  **\nC'est un mari incroyant. Votre caractère envers lui peut le convertir. Il ne prend peut-être pas la peine d'apprécier votre caractère, mais vous avez donné à Dieu quelque chose sur quoi travailler et l'attirer à lui. Homme, aime ta femme, prends soin d'elle même si elle est têtue. Dieu est votre témoin. Il vous favorisera, vous réconfortera, combattra pour vous, vous justifiera et vous enlèvera parce qu'Il sait que vous gardez Sa Parole.  **\n9.6. ASSUREZ-VOUS QUE DIEU EST DE VOTRE CÔTÉ  **\nPsaume 118 verset 6 à 7  **\n6 Le Seigneur est pour moi ; Je ne crains rien, que peut me faire l'homme ?\n7 Le Seigneur prend ma part avec ceux qui m'aident; c'est pourquoi je verrai mon désir sur ceux qui me haïssent.  **\nDe toute évidence, dans l'Écriture ci-dessus, le psalmiste était en difficulté mais a choisi de ne pas marcher dans la peur ou le découragement mais de reconnaître la présence de Dieu. En toute confiance, ayez confiance que Dieu s'occupera de vos ennemis. Dieu est toujours du côté des justes pour les aider. Pour le psalmiste ci-dessus, ses ennemis étaient ses adversaires qu'il voulait que Dieu juge. Mais quant à vous dont l'ennemi est maintenant votre conjoint, vous ne souhaitez pas que Dieu fasse du mal à votre conjoint. Cependant, votre désir devrait être que Dieu le traite d'une manière que ce soit le jugement ou tout autre moyen qui le fera revenir à la raison et se repentir afin que vous puissiez profiter ensemble de la vie éternelle.  **\n9.7. EXERCEZ LA SAGESSE ET LA PRUDENCE.  **\nLa prudence est la sagesse en action.  **\nProverbes 12 verset 23  **\n23 L'homme prudent cache la connaissance, mais le cœur des insensés proclame la folie.  **\nLa sagesse et la prudence vous permettront de savoir quand retenir ou divulguer des informations à votre conjoint incroyant. Par exemple, vous êtes une femme et vous souhaitez assister à une conférence chrétienne. Il se trouve que votre mari incroyant, qui ne voudrait généralement pas que vous assistiez à une telle conférence, est absent. La sagesse exige que vous vous rendiez tranquillement à votre réunion et que vous vous amusiez plutôt que de le tenter de demander son approbation alors que vous connaissez déjà le résultat. De même, un homme prudent ne partagera pas d'informations susceptibles de créer des problèmes avec un partenaire incroyant.  **\nEsther dans la Bible est un exemple clair de quelqu'un qui a fait preuve de beaucoup de prudence dans ses relations avec son mari, le roi.  **\nProverbes 13 verset 16  **\n16 Tout homme prudent agit avec connaissance, mais l'insensé dévoile sa folie.  **\nEn tant que personne prudente, assurez-vous toujours d'agir avec connaissance, une connaissance précise, sur une question, et non avec des soupçons. Renseignez-vous sur tous les faits avant de confronter votre conjoint à propos de n'importe quelle question. Les accuser à tort pourrait les inciter à se rebeller ou à devenir plus rebelles.  **\nProverbes 14 verset 15  **\n15 Le simple croit chaque parole, mais l'homme prudent regarde bien sa marche.   **\nL'homme prudent juge. Il considère et examine tout pour connaître la vérité.  **\nProverbes 18 verset 15  **\n15 Le cœur de l'homme prudent acquiert la connaissance ; et l'oreille du sage cherche la connaissance.  **\nObtenez plus de connaissances. Il y a de la sécurité avec plus d'informations ou de connaissances. Engagez-vous à écouter des enseignements bibliques solides. Lire de plus en plus de livres. La connaissance vous permettra d'être plus confiant et vous aidera à mieux gérer les choses dans votre mariage et votre vie.  **\nProverbes 19 verset 14  **\n14 La maison et les richesses sont l'héritage des pères et une femme prudente vient du Seigneur.  **\nFemmes, Dieu veut que vous soyez prudentes, que vous sachiez toujours vous comporter avec votre mari et en toute matière.  **\nProverbes 22 verset 3  **\n3 L'homme prudent prévoit le mal et se cache, mais les simples passent et sont punis.  **\nUn homme prudent anticipe. Il réfléchit avant de prendre des mesures. Il dira   « Si je suis ce cours, cela pourrait être le résultat. Je veux éviter cela, donc je n'irai pas dans cette direction. Pendant ce temps, une personne irréfléchie passe et en subit les conséquences.  **\nAgissez prudemment dans votre mariage, surtout lorsque votre partenaire n'est pas juste. Abigaïl avait un mari injuste et a agi très sagement avec lui. Alors, assurez-vous de bien agir dans votre maison pour permettre à la justice de régner.\nQue Dieu utilise ce livre pour bénir votre mariage et les mariages de beaucoup d'autres grâce à vos efforts. **\nPasteur Paul Rika\n",

      "body": "RENDRE VOTRE PÈRE ET VOTRE MÈRE HEUREUX DE VOTRE VIE  **\n\nPRÉSENTATION  **\nRendre votre père et votre mère heureux par votre vie est un livre inspiré écrit aux enfants et aux jeunes sur la soumission et l'obéissance aux parents et à leurs dirigeants de la manière approuvée par Dieu. Ce livre ouvrira les yeux de nombreux enfants et jeunes sur la parole et le commandement de Dieu et en obligera beaucoup à se soumettre et à obéir à leurs parents. Dieu promet une récompense aux enfants qui obéissent à leurs parents selon la volonté de Dieu. L'auteur souligne également que l'Écriture condamne quiconque obéit aux instructions des parents, si cela est contraire à la parole de Dieu.  **\nEphésiens 6 verset 1 à 3  **\n1 Enfants, obéissez à vos parents dans le Seigneur car cela est juste.\n2 Honore ton père et ta mère; (qui est le premier commandement avec promesse ;)\n3 Afin que tu sois bien, et que tu vives longtemps sur la terre.  **\nLe livre est écrit pour promouvoir la piété et la sainteté chez les enfants et les jeunes hommes et femmes dans l'église et dans la société pour la joie de Dieu et de leurs parents.\nProverbes 23 verset 25  **\n25 Ton père et ta mère se réjouiront, et celle qui t'a enfanté se réjouira.\nProverbes 27 verset 11  **\n11 Mon fils, sois sage et réjouis mon cœur, afin que je réponde à celui qui m'insulte .  **\nLes jeunes qui désirent plaire à Dieu devraient faire de ce livre un compagnon de lecture régulière. Les parents devraient mettre ce livre entre les mains de toute leur église et les encourager à le lire. Les familles et les églises peuvent utiliser ce livre comme étude de dévotion ou comme manuel de l'école du dimanche. Que le Seigneur utilise ce livre pour délivrer de nombreuses jeunes vies de la main de Satan au nom de Jésus.\nEsaïe 49 verset 24, 25  **\n24 La proie sera-t-elle prise au puissant, ou le captif légitime sera-t-il délivré ?\n25 Mais ainsi dit le Seigneur   Même les captifs des puissants seront enlevés, et la proie des terribles sera délivrée, car je combattrai contre celui qui te conteste, et je sauverai tes enfants.  **\nEphésiens 6 verset 1 à 3  **\n1 Enfants, obéissez à vos parents dans le Seigneur car cela est juste.\n2 Honore ton père et ta mère; (qui est le premier commandement avec promesse ;)\n3 Afin que tu sois bien, et que tu vives longtemps sur la terre.  **\nCette Écriture est liée à l'obéissance à votre père et à votre mère dans le Seigneur. Votre obéissance devrait être dans des domaines qui rendront Dieu heureux avec vous et non dans des domaines qui le rendront triste. Votre père ne devrait pas vous demander d'aller tuer quelqu'un ou d'épouser la femme d'un autre ; ta mère ne doit pas non plus te demander d'aller voler les biens de quelqu'un et tu y tiens.  **\nDeutéronome 13 verset 6, 8  **\n6 Si ton frère, le fils de ta mère, ou ton fils, ou ta fille, ou la femme de ton sein, ou ton ami, qui est comme ton âme, te séduisait en secret, en disant   Allons et servons d'autres dieux , que tu n'as pas connu, ni toi, ni tes pères;\n8 Tu ne lui consentiras pas, tu ne l'écouteras pas; ton œil ne le plaindra pas, tu ne l'épargneras pas, tu ne le cacheras pas non plus;  **\nCe n'est pas l'obéissance au Seigneur. Dieu n'est pas satisfait de telles affectations et dans ce cas, vous et vos parents serez jugés, car ils vous ont utilisé pour faire le mal. Cependant, en matière de légitimité, des choses qui sont justes, comme « va me chercher de l'eau, lave des assiettes pour moi, fais une course pour moi » et ainsi de suite ; c'est bien et acceptable. Rendez-les heureux en faisant cela et ils vous béniront. Même s'ils ne prononcent pas de bénédictions sur vous, Dieu vous bénira certainement. Si vous continuez de cette manière, tout ira bien pour vous dans la vie et de nombreuses situations de mort seront évitées pour avoir obéi à la parole de Dieu envers vos parents.  **\nMatthieu 15 verset 4  **\n4 Car Dieu a commandé, en disant   Honore ton père et ta mère ; et, Celui qui maudit son père ou sa mère, qu'il meure.  **\nCelui qui bat père et mère est maudit. En fait, cet enfant est méchant. Même si votre père ou votre mère vous maltraite ou dit du mal de vous, ne les maudissez pas. En supposant que votre père vous combat, n'essayez pas de le combattre. Le jugement pour cela est la mort éternelle, à moins que vous ne vous repentiez. Il est important de noter qu'il s'agit d'un commandement et que Dieu place les bénédictions de la vie sur les enfants qui obéissent à leurs parents. Dieu maudit aussi ceux qui désobéissent à leurs parents. L'Écriture montre clairement que les parents sont heureux lorsque leurs enfants se comportent bien et sont tristes lorsque leurs enfants sont têtus.  **\nProverbes 23 verset 25  **\n25 Ton père et ta mère se réjouiront, et celle qui t'a enfanté se réjouira.  **\n\nCHAPITRE UN  **\nLES ENFANTS SAGES ET FOUS  **\n1.1 Le caractère des enfants sages et insensés.  **\nProverbes 10 verset 1  **\nLes proverbes de Salomon. Un fils sage rend un père heureux, mais un fils insensé est la pesanteur de sa mère.   **\nUn enfant sage rendra le père et la mère heureux et même ses parents et tuteurs. Les voisins l'apprécieront et le montreront comme un bon exemple à leurs enfants. D'autre part, si l'enfant est têtu ou insensé, il apportera de la douleur et du chagrin à son père et à sa mère. Avez-vous déjà pensé à cela, que les écritures mettent toujours l'accent sur le chagrin de l'enfant capricieux sur la mère et non sur le père ? La raison en est que le père tournera automatiquement le dos à cet enfant, le niant comme son enfant mais mettant plutôt l'égarement de cet enfant sur la mère pour qu'elle en supporte seule la honte. Malheureusement, la mère ne peut pas le renier aussi facilement que le père. Elle doit assumer la douleur et le chagrin. Le roi Saül, dans sa colère contre Jonathan, lui dit « toi, fils de la femme rebelle perverse »,  **\nPremier Samuel 20 verset 30  **\nAlors la colère de Saül s'enflamma contre Jonathan, et il lui dit   Toi, fils de la femme rebelle perverse, ne sais-je pas que tu as choisi le fils de Jessé pour ta propre confusion, et pour la confusion de la nudité de ta mère ?  **\nVous devez comprendre qu'un enfant sage est un enfant qui se comporte bien et qui réussit bien, et dont on parle bien à l'école, dans la société et dans l'église. Les gens louent et saluent un enfant pour sa bonne conduite et son excellent esprit. Alors que de l'autre côté de la médaille, si l'enfant est stupide, la mère vivra dans la honte et le chagrin. Dans le texte ci-dessus, la mère de Jonathan était-elle présente ? Pas du tout. Quel mal a-t-elle fait pour donner naissance à Jonathan ? C'est parce que le fils s'est comporté contrairement à l'intérêt du roi Saül. Cela l'a fait maltraité et a condamné la mère pour lui avoir donné naissance. Ici, vous pouvez clairement voir le poids et le fardeau du blâme qui est transféré à votre mère à cause de votre attitude désobéissante et têtue.  **\n1.2 Caractéristiques d'un enfant insensé  **\nUn enfant insensé est celui qui méprise ses parents et peut les maudire ou les combattre.  **\nProverbes 19 verset 26  **\nCelui qui perd son père et chasse sa mère, est un fils qui fait honte et attire l'opprobre.  **\nL'enfant insensé se moque de ses parents et dit du mal d'eux à la moindre offense. Il ne leur montre aucun respect ; au contraire, il les méprise. Il ne les aide pas et ne se soucie pas non plus de leur appel à l'aide. Il n'obéit pas à leurs instructions, au contraire, il les chasse et les fait honte. Ne vous comportez pas ainsi avec vos parents. Aimez-les et obéissez-leur et ils seront heureux que vous soyez leur fils ou leur fille. Dieu vous bénira aussi.  **\nProverbes 23 verset 15 à 16  **\n15 Mon fils, si ton cœur est sage, mon cœur se réjouira, même le mien.\n16 Oui, mes reins se réjouiront, quand tes lèvres prononcent des choses justes.  **\nC'est un parent qui parle à l'enfant; conseiller à l'enfant de se soumettre à l'enseignement de la sagesse, de marcher sur le bon chemin et de se soumettre à Dieu pour un changement de vie afin que Dieu puisse le rendre paisible, heureux et joyeux. Êtes-vous le genre d'enfant qui ment toujours ? Vos bons parents voudront que vous disiez toujours la vérité. Dieu voudra aussi que vous disiez la vérité, même si vous craignez que cela ne vous blesse. Dire des mensonges fait de vous un enfant de Satan.   **\nEsaïe 30 verset 9  **\n9 Que c'est un peuple rebelle, des enfants menteurs, des enfants qui n'entendront pas la loi du Seigneur  **\nJean 8 verset 44  **\n44 Vous avez pour père le diable, et vous ferez les désirs de votre père. Il était un meurtrier dès le commencement, et ne demeurait pas dans la vérité, car il n'y a pas de vérité en lui. Quand il prononce un mensonge, il prononce le sien; car il est un menteur, et le père de celui-ci.  **\nCertains enfants méchants battent leurs parents pour les déshonorer ou les maltraiter. Il y a un grand jugement de Dieu contre de tels enfants dans ce monde et en enfer.  **\nProverbes 30 verset 11, 17  **\n11 Il y a une génération qui maudit son père et ne bénit pas sa mère.\n17 L'œil qui se moque de son père et qui méprise d'obéir à sa mère, les corbeaux de la vallée l'arracheront, et les jeunes aigles le dévoreront.  **\nProverbes 20 verset 20  **\n20 Quiconque maudira son père ou sa mère, sa lampe s'éteindra dans les ténèbres obscures.\nMatthieu 15 verset 4  **\n4 Car Dieu a commandé, en disant   Honore ton père et ta mère ; et, Celui qui maudit son père ou sa mère, qu'il meure.  **\nCertains enfants volent leurs parents en pensant que ce n'est pas un péché. C'est la même infraction que de voler quelqu'un d'autre.  **\nProverbes 28 verset 24  **\n24 Quiconque vole son père ou sa mère, et dit   Ce n'est pas une transgression ; le même est le compagnon d'un destroyer.  **\nIl y a des enfants qui tueront leur père et chasseront leur mère de la maison à cause de leur méchanceté.  **\nProverbes 19 verset 26  **\n26 Celui qui perd son père et chasse sa mère est un fils qui fait honte et qui attire l'opprobre.  **\nCe genre d'enfants est corrompu et a abandonné le Seigneur. Satan les utilise comme instruments du mal et de la méchanceté parmi les hommes de la société.  **\nEsaïe 1 verset 4  **\n4 Nation pécheresse, peuple chargé d'iniquité, semence de malfaiteurs, fils de pervers, ils ont abandonné l'Éternel, ils ont irrité le Saint d'Israël, ils sont repartis à la renverse.  **\nPremier Samuel 2 verset 12  **\n12 Les fils d'Eli étaient fils de Bélial ; ils ne connaissaient pas le Seigneur.  **\nLa situation semble plus terrible et pathétique lorsque les parents sont ministres de l'évangile   la société s'attend habituellement à ce que ces enfants soient pieux dans leur caractère, mais Satan essaie toujours de les coincer dans son royaume. C'est pourquoi les enfants ainsi que leurs parents et l'église doivent prier pour la délivrance des enfants de la main de Satan.  **\n1.3 Ce que les parents craignant Dieu désirent pour leurs enfants.  **\nLes parents demandent normalement à leurs enfants de vivre pieusement afin qu'ils puissent être heureux. Les parents chrétiens font un effort supplémentaire pour prêcher à leurs enfants de soumettre leur vie à Jésus afin qu'eux aussi soient saints, heureux et héritent du royaume de Dieu à la fin   **\nProverbes 23 verset 24 verset 25  **\n24 Le père du juste se réjouira beaucoup ; et celui qui engendre un enfant sage aura de la joie pour lui.\n25 Ton père et ta mère se réjouiront, et celle qui t'a enfanté se réjouira. Quand tu es un bon enfant, tu les rends heureux.  **\nVous êtes peut-être le seul enfant, mais comme c'est horrible si vous, le seul enfant, êtes un voleur à main armée. Mais imaginez si l'enfant unique est un enfant pieux   humble, respectueux et bien élevé, vous serez pour vos parents plus que 10 enfants, tout comme Jean-Baptiste. Les parents se réjouissent quand ils ont de bons enfants. D'autre part, les parents d'enfants mauvais subissent des reproches de la part des gens de leur quartier , des écoles et de l'église. Les gens rient et se moquent d'eux.  **\nVotre mère est continuellement dans le chagrin et l'amertume à cause de votre style de vie méprisant. Avec cette attitude, de nombreux parents supplient sérieusement leurs enfants de ne pas venir quand ils ont des visiteurs. Leurs vêtements sont mauvais et impies. Leur apparence montre la folie. Leur nudité et leur indécence tourmentent leurs parents et leur font honte. C'est pourquoi ils désirent dans leur prière que leurs enfants soient sauvés et délivrés d'un mode de vie indécent et irresponsable qui leur apporte des reproches. Porter des robes courtes, des jupes, des robes moulantes, une coiffure impie, une décoloration, une coupe de cheveux amusante, exposer vos fesses, porter des robes déchirées, etc. sont des activités qui font honte aux parents pieux.  **\nProverbes 27 verset 11  **\n11 Mon fils, sois sage et réjouis mon cœur, afin que je réponde à celui qui m'insulte .  **\nPar conséquent, soyez un bon garçon et une bonne fille. Ne permettez pas à vos parents d'avoir de mauvaises nouvelles à votre sujet pour ce que vous avez fait sans vergogne à l'école ou dans la société. Changez votre attitude afin que vos parents puissent avoir quoi dire à leurs accusateurs s'ils essaient de leur faire des reproches. Jésus vous appelle également à venir suivre son style de vie.  **\nProverbes 1 verset 22 à 23  **\n22 Jusques à quand, simples, aimerez-vous la simplicité ? et les moqueurs prennent plaisir à leur mépris, et les insensés détestent la connaissance ?\n23 Revenez à ma réprimande, voici, je répandrai mon esprit sur vous, je vous ferai connaître mes paroles.  **\nDieu bénira vos parents et votre famille si vous coopérez avec vos parents pour mener une vie pieuse et sainte.  **\nDeuxième Jean 1 à 4  **\n1 L'aîné à la femme élue et à ses enfants, que j'aime dans la vérité; et non seulement moi, mais aussi tous ceux qui ont connu la vérité ;\n2 A cause de la vérité, qui habite en nous et qui sera avec nous pour toujours .\n3 Que la grâce, la miséricorde et la paix soient avec vous, de la part de Dieu le Père et de la part du Seigneur Jésus Christ, le Fils du Père, dans la vérité et dans l'amour.\n4 Je me suis beaucoup réjoui de trouver tes enfants marchant dans la vérité, comme nous avons reçu un commandement du Père.  **\n1.4 La piété et la sagesse sont bonnes pour vous  **\nProverbes 29 verset 3  **\n3 Celui qui aime la sagesse réjouit son père, mais celui qui fréquente les prostituées dépense son bien.  **\nProverbes 4 verset 7 à 10  **\n7 La sagesse est la chose principale; acquiers donc la sagesse, et avec tout ce que tu as acquis, acquiers l'intelligence.\n8 Exalte-la, et elle t'élèvera, elle t'honorera , quand tu l'embrasseras.\n9 Elle donnera à ta tête un ornement de grâce, une couronne de gloire qu'elle te remettra.\n10 Écoute, ô mon fils, et reçois mes paroles; et les années de ta vie seront nombreuses.  **\nLa parole de Dieu pour vous est donc, donnez-vous à la vie de vérité, de justice et de sainteté. Soyez pieux et recherchez la sagesse. Habillez-vous de Jésus tous les jours de votre vie. Repentez-vous et changez le témoignage de votre vie dans la famille, la société et dans l'église. Décidez-vous et changez.  **\n1.5 Méditez sur ces mots    **\nJosué 1 verset 8  **\nCe livre de la loi ne s'éloignera pas de ta bouche; mais tu y méditeras jour et nuit, afin de veiller à faire selon tout ce qui y est écrit, car alors tu feras prospérer ta voie, et alors tu auras de bons succès  **\nImposez-vous la main et dites que je me décide à changer aujourd'hui, je ne serai plus méchant, je ne serai plus désobéissant et brutal dans ma vie. J'apporterai de bons témoignages sur ma vie. Les gens entendront de nouvelles choses sur moi. Mes parents verront la différence ou les changements en moi. J'enlèverai la colère de mon père. Certains d'entre vous sont les raisons pour lesquelles votre père et votre mère se disputent toujours, alors réfléchissez aux mots ci-dessus et arrêtez de provoquer des querelles entre eux .  **\nLuc 15 verset 17 à 24  **\n17 Et quand il revint à lui, il dit   Combien de mercenaires de mon père ont du pain en suffisance et en surplus, et je meurs de faim !\n18 Je me lèverai, j'irai vers mon père, et je lui dirai   Père, j'ai péché contre le ciel et contre toi,\n19 Et je ne suis plus digne d'être appelé ton fils, fais de moi l'un de tes mercenaires.\n20 Et il se leva, et vint vers son père. Mais alors qu'il était encore très loin, son père le vit, eut pitié, courut, se jeta à son cou et l'embrassa.\n21 Et le fils lui dit   Père, j'ai péché contre le ciel et contre toi, et je ne suis plus digne d'être appelé ton fils.\n22 Mais le père dit à ses serviteurs   Apportez la plus belle robe, et mettez-la-lui ; et mit un anneau à sa main, et des souliers à ses pieds; 23 Et amenez ici le veau gras, et tuez-le ; et mangeons, et réjouissons-nous  \n24 Car celui-ci, mon fils, était mort, et il est revenu à la vie ; il était perdu et est retrouvé. Et ils commencèrent à être joyeux.  **\nAprès vous être repenti, cela vous fera du bien si vous maintenez une vie juste et sainte. rejoignez une véritable communauté d'enfants de Dieu pour apprendre les enseignements divins de la parole de Dieu.  **\nDeuxième Timothée 2 verset 22  **\n22 Fuyez aussi les convoitises de la jeunesse ; mais suivez la justice, la foi, la charité, la paix, avec ceux qui invoquent le Seigneur d'un cœur pur.  **\nPremier Jean 1 verset 3 à 7  **\n3 Nous vous annonçons ce que nous avons vu et entendu, afin que vous aussi soyez en communion avec nous ; et vraiment notre communion est avec le Père, et avec son Fils Jésus-Christ.\n4 Et nous t'écrivons ces choses, afin que ta joie soit parfaite.\n5 Voici donc le message que nous avons entendu de lui, et que nous vous annonçons, que Dieu est lumière, et qu'il n'y a en lui aucune ténèbres. 6 Si nous disons que nous sommes en communion avec lui, et que nous marchons dans les ténèbres, nous mentons et ne faisons pas la vérité ;\n7 Mais si nous marchons dans la lumière, comme il est dans la lumière, nous sommes en communion les uns avec les autres, et le sang de Jésus-Christ, son Fils, nous purifie de tout péché.  **\nColossiens 2 verset 6 à 8  **\n6 Comme vous avez donc reçu Christ Jésus le Seigneur, marchez en lui ;\n7 Enracinés et édifiés en lui, et affermis dans la foi, selon que vous avez été enseignés, abondant en actions de grâces.\n8 Prenez garde que personne ne vous gâte par la philosophie et par de vaines tromperies, selon la tradition des hommes, selon les rudiments du monde, et non selon Christ.  **\n\nCHAPITRE DEUX  **\nRÉCITS BIBLIQUES DE QUELQUES ENFANTS IMPIES  **\n2.1 Exemples d'enfants qui ont fait souffrir leurs parents  **\nLa Bible nous parle de certains enfants qui apportèrent chagrin et honte à leurs parents. Nous en considérerons cinq    **\n2.1.1 Dina  **\nGenèse 34 verset 1 à 7  **\nEt Dina, fille de Léa, qu'elle avait enfantée à Jacob, sortit pour voir les filles du pays.\n2 Et quand Sichem, fils de Hamor , le Hivite, prince du pays, la vit, il la prit, et coucha avec elle, et la souilla.\n3 Et son âme s'est attachée à Dinah, la fille de Jacob, et il a aimé la jeune fille, et a parlé avec bonté à la jeune fille.\n4 Et Sichem parla à son père Hamor , disant   Prends-moi cette jeune fille pour femme.\n5 Et Jacob apprit qu'il avait souillé Dina, sa fille . Or ses fils étaient avec son bétail dans les champs et Jacob garda le silence jusqu'à leur arrivée.\n6 Et Hamor , père de Sichem, sortit vers Jacob pour s'entretenir avec lui.\n7 Et les fils de Jacob sortirent des champs quand ils l'entendirent ; et les hommes furent affligés, et ils furent très en colère, parce qu'il avait fait une folie en Israël en couchant avec la fille de Jacob; chose qu'il ne faut pas faire.  **\nJacob et sa famille déménageaient vers la Terre Promise, alors ils sont venus dans un pays où ils ont campé pendant un certain temps. Alors Dinah, la fille de Jacob, alla jouer avec les enfants du pays. Elle y est allée, définitivement inconnue de son peuple. Mais ce jour-là, elle n'a pas échappé. Ils l'ont prise et l'ont souillée dans l'immoralité, et l'ont enfermée avec l'homme. Le rapport parvint à ses parents que Dinah avait été déflorée. Quel chagrin pour sa mère et pour Jacob l'homme de Dieu. La seule enfant de sexe féminin parmi ses douze fils.  **\nLévitique 19 verset 29  **\n29 Ne prostitue pas ta fille, pour qu'elle devienne une prostituée; de peur que le pays ne tombe dans la prostitution, et que le pays ne devienne plein de méchanceté.  **\nComme c'était douloureux pour les frères ! Cela les a beaucoup attristés. Vous pensez que cet acte immoral dans lequel vous vous engagez est une chose simple ou légère ? C'est une douleur et un embarras pour vos parents et pour l'église. Pourtant, c'est ce que font de nombreux jeunes pour se corrompre et attirer le jugement de Dieu sur l'église et leurs familles.  **\n1 Corinthiens 5 verset 1, 2  **\n1 On rapporte communément qu'il y a de l'impudicité parmi vous, et une impudicité telle qu'elle n'est même pas nommée parmi les Gentils, pour que l'on ait la femme de son père.\n2 Et vous vous êtes enflés d'orgueil, et vous n'avez pas plutôt pleuré, afin que celui qui a fait cet acte soit enlevé du milieu de vous.  **\nPar exemple, on m'a présenté le cas d'un garçon qui est venu à la conférence internationale des jeunes de 2019 depuis Gwagwalada, Abuja, Nigeria, et une fille qui est venue à la même conférence depuis Port Harcourt, Nigeria. Comment ils se connaissaient me dépasse. On m'a dit qu'ils étaient allés dans la brousse voisine pour commettre l'immoralité. Même si je savais que notre personnel de sécurité les avait fouettés sans pitié et que le garçon avait été renvoyé du camp. Mais vous pouvez imaginer à quel point cet acte fâcheux a apporté chagrin et honte à leurs parents. J'ai ordonné que la fille soit traitée de manière appropriée et réprimandée pour avoir déshonoré ses parents. Prenez note de ceci   si vous voyez quelqu'un se livrer à cet acte ignoble ou à toute forme de péché, pour apporter la honte et la disgrâce au camp et au peuple de Dieu, la personne doit être réprimandée et dénoncée pour que des mesures appropriées soient prises parce que les conférences tenues ou organisé au nom de Dieu aussi Son camp ne devrait pas être souillé par l'immoralité ou d'autres péchés quels qu'ils soient, car la présence de Dieu est toujours avec Ses enfants justes.  **\nDeutéronome 23 verset 14  **\nCar l'Éternel, ton Dieu, marche au milieu de ton camp, pour te délivrer, et pour livrer tes ennemis devant toi; c'est pourquoi ton camp sera saint, afin qu'il ne voie rien d'impur en toi, et qu'il se détourne de toi.  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 3 à 7  **\n3 Mais la fornication, et toute impureté, ou convoitise, qu'elle ne soit pas nommée une seule fois parmi vous, comme il convient aux saints ;\n4 Ni souillure, ni propos insensés, ni plaisanteries, qui ne conviennent pas, mais plutôt des actions de grâces.\n5 Car vous savez ceci, qu'aucun impudique, ni impur, ni cupide, qui est un idolâtre, n'a d'héritage dans le royaume de Christ et de Dieu.\n6 Que personne ne vous séduise par de vaines paroles, car à cause de ces choses vient la colère de Dieu sur les enfants de la désobéissance.\n7 Ne participez donc pas avec eux.  **\nProverbes 31 verset 2 à 4  **\n2 Quoi, mon fils ? et quoi, le fils de mon ventre? et quoi, le fils de mes voeux ? 3 Ne donne pas ta force aux femmes, ni tes voies à celle qui détruit les rois. 4 Ce n'est pas aux rois, Lémuel, ce n'est pas aux rois de boire du vin ; ni pour les boissons fortes des princes  **\nLe diable a déversé l'esprit d'immoralité sur la société humaine et même sur l'église du Christ. Divers types d'immoralité sexuelle sont pratiqués par les jeunes; cela inclut   la masturbation, la fornication, l'homosexualité, le lesbianisme, l'inceste, la bestialité, la sodomie, etc. Les jeunes de nos jours se livrent à la pornographie et aux films sexuels pour s'exciter. Il y a aussi le doigté des enfants et la maltraitance des enfants. La gloire du mariage est fortement réduite car beaucoup s'y précipitent parce qu'ils ont abusé de ce privilège. Beaucoup viennent à l'autel du mariage déjà souillés et enceintes à la honte de leurs parents et à la souillure de l'église. Dieu les jugera pour tout cela sauf s'ils se repentent. Vous qui craignez Dieu, retirez-vous de ce genre de vie. Ne les rejoignez pas. Ne cherchez pas une femme ou un mari parmi ces genres de jeunes. Marchez avec Dieu dans la justice et comptez sur lui pour tous vos besoins. Servez-Le de tout votre cœur et Il vous bénira.  **\n2 Corinthiens 6 verset 14 à 18.  **\n14 Ne soyez-vous pas sous un joug inégal avec les non-croyants, car quelle relation y a-t-il entre la justice et l'injustice ? et quelle communion a la lumière avec les ténèbres ?\n15 Et quelle concorde a Christ avec Bélial ? ou quelle part a celui qui croit avec un infidèle?\n16 Et quel accord le temple de Dieu a-t-il avec les idoles ? car vous êtes le temple du Dieu vivant; comme Dieu l'a dit, j'habiterai en eux et je marcherai en eux; et je serai leur Dieu, et ils seront mon peuple.\n17 C'est pourquoi, sortez du milieu d'eux, et séparez-vous, dit le Seigneur, et ne touchez pas à ce qui est impur ; et je te recevrai,\n18 Et vous serez un père, et vous serez mes fils et mes filles, dit le Seigneur tout-puissant.  **\nEsaïe 1 verset 16 à 20  **\n16 Lave-toi, purifie-toi; ôte de devant mes yeux la méchanceté de tes actions; cesser de faire le mal;\n17 Apprenez à bien faire; Cherchez le jugement, soulagez l'opprimé, jugez l'orphelin, plaidez pour la veuve.\n18 Venez maintenant, et plaidons ensemble, dit le Seigneur, même si vos péchés sont comme le cramoisi, ils deviendront blancs comme la neige ; s'ils sont rouges comme la pourpre, ils seront comme la laine.\n19 Si vous êtes volontaires et obéissants, vous mangerez les biens du pays.\n20 Mais si vous refusez et vous rebellez, vous serez dévorés par l'épée , car la bouche de l'Éternel l'a dit.  **\n2.1.2 Siméon et Lévi  **\nC'étaient deux fils de Jacob qui étaient enclins à la colère et à la cruauté. Ils étaient toujours intéressés à se battre contre d'autres enfants et à faire la guerre tribale. Jacob vivait dans la peur des répercussions de leur vie. Il y a des enfants comme ça qui sont toujours gênants et méchants. La police a souvent été appelée à plusieurs reprises au sujet de leur mauvaise conduite.  **\nGenèse 34 verset 25 à 30  **\n25 Et il arriva, le troisième jour, alors qu'ils étaient affligés, que deux des fils de Jacob, Siméon et Lévi, frères de Dinah, prirent chacun son épée, et vinrent hardiment sur la ville, et tuèrent tous les mâles.\n26 Et ils frappèrent Hamor et Sichem, son fils, au fil de l'épée, et firent sortir Dina de la maison de Sichem, et sortirent.\n27 Les fils de Jacob vinrent sur les morts et pillèrent la ville, parce qu'ils avaient souillé leur sœur. 28 Ils prirent leurs brebis, et leurs boeufs, et leurs ânes, et ce qui était dans la ville, et ce qui était dans les champs,\n29 Et tous leurs biens, et tous leurs petits enfants, et leurs femmes, les emmenèrent captifs, et pillèrent même tout ce qui était dans la maison.\n30 Et Jacob dit à Siméon et à Lévi   Vous m'avez troublé pour me faire puer parmi les habitants du pays, parmi les Cananéens et les Perizzites ; et moi étant peu nombreux, ils se rassembleront contre moi, et me tueront; et je serai détruit, moi et ma maison.  **\nCertains enfants fument et consomment des drogues dures. Certains sont dans de grands maux dans la société, tels que le meurtre, l'assassinat, le vol à main armée, le viol, etc. Ce sont les mécréants sociaux et les voyous politiques. Ils se livrent à des enlèvements pour de l'argent rapide. Ils voudront se lier d'amitié avec vous et vous faire les rejoindre. Ils se livrent à une musique sensuelle et diabolique ou mondaine. Tenez-vous loin d'eux. Ne rejoignez pas leur compagnie et ne désirez pas leurs gains. Ils disparaîtront bientôt par la mort et le jugement divin dans le feu éternel.  **\nProverbes 1 verset 8 à 19  **\n8 Mon fils, écoute l'instruction de ton père, et n'abandonne pas la loi de ta mère ;\n9 Car ils seront un ornement de grâce sur ta tête, et des chaînes autour de ton cou.\n10 Mon fils, si des pécheurs t'attirent, n'y consens pas. 11 S'ils disent   Venez avec nous, guettons le sang, guettons en secret l'innocent sans cause ;\n12 Engloutis-les vivants comme le sépulcre ; et entiers, comme ceux qui descendent dans la fosse;\n13 Nous trouverons toutes les richesses précieuses, nous remplirons nos maisons de butin  \n14 Jette ton sort parmi nous; ayons tous une bourse; 15 Mon fils, ne marche pas en chemin avec eux ; retiens ton pied de leur chemin; 16 Car leurs pieds courent au mal et se hâtent de répandre le sang.\n17 C'est en vain que le filet est tendu à la vue de n'importe quel oiseau. 18 Et ils attendaient leur propre sang ; ils se cachent en secret pour leur propre vie.\n19 Ainsi sont les voies de tout homme avide de gain; qui enlève la vie à ses propriétaires.  **\nVous pouvez imaginer la répercussion de l'égarement tel que décrit dans les versets ci-dessus de l'Écriture. Il vous est enjoint de fuir ou de vous abstenir de la mauvaise compagnie et du mauvais caractère.  **\nGenèse 49 verset 6  **\nÔ mon âme, n'entre pas dans leur secret ; à leur assemblée, mon honneur , ne sois pas uni, car dans leur colère ils ont tué un homme, et dans leur volonté ils ont creusé un mur.  **\nCertains enfants sont comme ça. Vos parents pleurent, voire maudissent, à cause de l'humiliation que vous leur apportez dans la société par votre vie capricieuse. Eli s'est lamenté jusqu'à sa mort à cause des mauvais comportements de ses enfants dans la maison de Dieu. Dieu a tué ses enfants à cause de leur mauvaise vie.  **\nPremier Samuel 2 verset 12, 17, 22 à 25, 34  **\n12 Les fils d'Eli étaient fils de Bélial ; ils ne connaissaient pas le Seigneur.\n17 C'est pourquoi le péché des jeunes hommes était très grand devant l'Éternel, car les hommes avaient en horreur l'offrande de l'Éternel. 22 Or Éli était très vieux et avait entendu tout ce que ses fils avaient fait à tout Israël ; et comment ils couchèrent avec les femmes qui s'assemblaient à l'entrée du tabernacle d'assignation.\n23 Et il leur dit   Pourquoi faites-vous de telles choses ? car j'ai entendu parler de vos mauvaises actions par tout ce peuple. 24 Non, mes fils ! car ce n'est pas un bon rapport que j'entends; vous faites transgresser le peuple de l'Éternel.\n25 Si un homme pèche contre un autre, le juge le jugera ; mais si un homme pèche contre l'Éternel, qui priera pour lui ? Cependant, ils n'écoutèrent pas la voix de leur père, parce que le Seigneur voulait les faire mourir.\n34 Et ceci sera pour toi un signe qui viendra sur tes deux fils, sur Hophni et Pinhas ; en un jour, ils mourront tous les deux.  **\nRejetez cette vie méchante. Détournez-vous de ces garçons et filles maudits et suivez Jésus.  **\nPsaumes 119 verset 59, 101  **\n59 J'ai réfléchi à mes voies, et j'ai tourné mes pas vers tes témoignages.\n101 J'ai retenu mes pieds de toute mauvaise voie, afin de garder ta parole.  **\n2.1.3 Esaü  **\nProverbes 23 verset 19  **\n19 Écoute, mon fils, et sois sage, et guide ton cœur dans le chemin.  **\nL'union conjugale d'Esaü avec une femme hittite n'était pas conforme au souhait de ses parents. Il se marie malgré tout au chagrin de son père et de sa mère.  **\nGenèse 26 verset 34 à 35  **\n34 Et Ésaü était âgé de quarante ans lorsqu'il prit pour femme Judith, fille de Beeri , le Hittite, et Bashemath , fille d'Elon, le Hittite.\n35 Ce qui était un chagrin d'esprit pour Isaac et pour Rebecca.  **\nCe qu'Esaü a fait était un chagrin de cœur pour Isaac et Rebecca. Sa décision et la façon dont il a abordé son mariage étaient inconvenantes, tout comme la plupart des jeunes le font aujourd'hui.  **\nGenèse 27 verset 46  **\n46 Et Rébecca dit à Isaac   Je suis fatigué de ma vie à cause des filles de Heth , si Jacob prend une femme parmi les filles de Heth , comme celles-ci qui sont des filles du pays, à quoi me servira ma vie ? ?  **\nRebecca n'était pas contente de ce qu'Esaü a fait et s'en est plainte à Isaac, elle craignait que Jacob ne fasse la même chose s'il n'était pas retenu. Certaines personnes préféreront même aller épouser des musulmans, sachant parfaitement qu'ils ne reconnaissent pas Jésus-Christ comme Seigneur et Sauveur. D'autres épousent des personnes terribles malgré l'avertissement de Dieu. Pendant ce temps, vos parents qui assistent fréquemment au mariage des autres attendent que votre tour vienne, seulement pour que la marée change. Si à votre tour, on découvre que vous êtes déjà enceinte avant le mariage, quelle calamité et quel chagrin ce sera pour eux !  **\nJob 3 verset 25  **\n25 Car ce que je craignais beaucoup m'est arrivé, et ce dont j'avais peur m'est arrivé.  **\nProverbes 15 verset 20  **\n20 Un fils sage rend un père heureux, mais un homme insensé méprise sa mère.   ** \nVos parents seront déçus et honteux d'apprendre que leur honorable fils a mis enceinte une dame et ne se mariera plus avec elle à l'église. Pour ne rien arranger, dans certains pays hors d'Afrique, comme l'Europe et l'Amérique où la Bible a été bouleversée, ce sont les parents qui se soumettent à leurs enfants et non l'inverse. \"Ils ont dit aux enfants à l'école de signaler leurs parents à la police s'ils les frappaient afin qu'ils ne les touchent plus jamais.\" On dit que cela se fait dans le respect des « lois sur les droits de l'enfant ». Par exemple, une femme parlait à son enfant de 8 ans, et elle a dû parler à haute voix parce qu'elle souffrait d'une surdité partielle. La fille n'était pas au courant. Alors, elle a parlé d'une voix forte à sa petite fille qui a plutôt été provoquée contre elle. Ignorant sa déficience auditive, la fille a téléphoné à la police. La police est entrée dans la maison au choc de sa mère. La femme a demandé à la police pourquoi ils étaient venus. Ils ont répondu que quelqu'un les avait appelés de la maison. Elle se demanda qui pouvait bien être cette personne, puisque la femme et la fille étaient les seules personnes présentes dans la maison. Ensuite, la police a demandé à l'enfant si c'était elle qui les avait appelés. Elle a admis et a dit que c'était elle qui avait appelé parce qu'elle n'aimait pas la façon dont sa mère lui criait dessus.  **\nCette attitude est assez courante chez les enfants vivant dans le monde occidental à cause du système moralement corrompu et impie en place. Néanmoins, les parents ne devraient pas avoir peur de cela. Ils doivent suivre les commandements de Dieu et le principe de la Bible. Sincèrement, là où cela nécessite la flagellation, les enfants doivent se soumettre au châtiment de leurs parents comme Dieu le leur a ordonné. Ne signalez pas vos parents à l'école, à la police ou au gouvernement pour vous avoir battu. Si vous échappez à la punition de vos parents à cause de votre entêtement, Dieu prendra en charge votre punition qui peut se terminer en enfer. L'Écriture a donné aux parents d'éduquer leurs enfants à toutes les formes de châtiment divin afin qu'ils grandissent dans la crainte de Dieu.  **\nProverbes 22 verset 6  **\nInstruisez un enfant dans la voie qu'il doit suivre et quand il sera vieux, il ne s'en écartera pas.  **\nProverbes 29 verset 15  **\n15 La verge et la réprimande donnent la sagesse, mais un enfant abandonné à lui-même fait honte à sa mère.  **\nProverbes 23 verset 13, 15  **\n13 Ne retiens pas la correction de l'enfant, car si tu le frappes avec la verge, il ne mourra pas.\n15 Mon fils, si ton cœur est sage, mon cœur se réjouira, même le mien.  **\n2.1.4 Michée  **\nMichée était un voleur. Il a volé de l'argent à sa mère. La mère s'est renseignée sur son argent, mais il a endurci son cœur à son égard. Puis, elle a commencé à pleuvoir toutes sortes de malédictions sur la personne qui a pris l'argent. En fait, la malédiction est devenue si forte que Micah a dû rendre l'argent instantanément.  **\nJuges 17 verset 1 à 2  **\n1 Et il y avait un homme de la montagne d'Éphraïm, dont le nom était Michée.\n2 Et il dit à sa mère   Les onze cents sicles d'argent qui t'ont été pris, au sujet desquels tu as maudit et dont tu as aussi parlé à mes oreilles, voici, l'argent est avec moi ; Je l'ai pris. Et sa mère dit   Béni sois-tu du Seigneur, mon fils.  **\nBeaucoup de garçons et de filles prennent le chemin du vol au grand dam de leurs parents. Ils partent progressivement de la maison et deviennent de grands voleurs dans la société. Certains parents préfèrent même que leurs enfants restent en prison plutôt qu'à la maison à cause de l'humiliation qu'ils en subissent.    **\nProverbes 28 verset 24  **\n24 Quiconque vole son père ou sa mère, et dit   Ce n'est pas une transgression ; le même est le compagnon d'un destroyer.  **\nEn dehors de cela, il y a beaucoup de péchés qui accompagnent le vol, comme le tabagisme, l'ivresse et l'immoralité. Beaucoup de ces enfants ont été animés par l'esprit du vol. Ils volent contre leur gré et n'ont aucun pouvoir propre pour arrêter la pratique. Seul Jésus peut les sauver et les délivrer de ce pouvoir. Jeune homme, crois en Jésus; invoquez Jésus. Criez à lui de vous délivrer.  **\nRomains 7 verset 19 à 25  **\n19 Car le bien que je voudrais, je ne le fais pas ; mais le mal que je ne voudrais pas, je le fais.\n20 Or, si je fais ce que je ne veux pas, ce n'est plus moi qui le fais, mais le péché qui habite en moi.\n21 Je trouve donc une loi selon laquelle, quand je veux faire le bien, le mal est présent avec moi. 22 Car je prends plaisir à la loi de Dieu selon l'homme intérieur;\n23 Mais je vois une autre loi dans mes membres, qui fait la guerre à la loi de mon esprit, et me rend captif de la loi du péché qui est dans mes membres.\n24 O misérable que je suis ! qui me délivrera du corps de cette mort ?\n25 Je rends grâces à Dieu par Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur. Ainsi donc, avec l'esprit, je sers moi-même la loi de Dieu ; mais avec la chair la loi du péché.  **\nCertains enfants de pasteurs font même honte à leurs parents en volant l'argent de l'église que leurs parents gardent à la maison. C'est une abomination qu'il ne faut pas trouver parmi les enfants de Dieu.  **\nJérémie 4 verset 22  **\n22 Car mon peuple est insensé, il ne m'a pas connu; ce sont des enfants stupides, et ils n'ont aucun sens, ils sont sages pour faire le mal, mais pour faire le bien, ils n'ont aucune connaissance.  **\nProverbes 17 verset 25  **\n25 Un fils insensé est un chagrin pour son père, et une amertume pour celle qui l'a enfanté.  **\nLe Seigneur vous appelle et je vous supplie d'arrêter votre mauvaise vie et de donner votre vie à Jésus-Christ afin que vos parents soient heureux, votre génération serez fier et heureux de votre style de vie pieux et vous ferez enfin le paradis.  **\nActes 16 verset 30 à 31  **\n30 Et les fit sortir, et dit   Messieurs, que dois-je faire pour être sauvé ?\n31 Et ils dirent   Crois au Seigneur Jésus-Christ, et tu seras sauvé, ainsi que ta maison.  **\nCherchez la délivrance dans une église juste. Cherchez des prières pour votre délivrance. Seuls les vrais et justes ministres de Dieu peuvent prier et briser le joug du péché ou de l'impiété dans votre vie.  **\nEsaïe 10 verset 27  **\n27 Et il arrivera, en ce jour-là, que son fardeau sera ôté de dessus ton épaule, et son joug de dessus ton cou, et le joug sera détruit à cause de l'onction.  **\n2..1.5 Hophni et Phinehas  **\nLes fils d'Eli Hophni et de Phinehas étaient de mauvais enfants. La Bible les appelle les fils de Bélial, c'est-à-dire les enfants de Satan. Ils servaient vigoureusement le diable et souillaient le saint temple de Dieu. Ils étaient cupides, adultères, cupides et pécheurs. Ils ont corrompu le service de Dieu au grand dam de leur père. Cela a amené un jugement divin sur eux et leur père. Dieu a vu Eli comme un homme faible ; celui qui ne pouvait pas exercer son autorité contre les actes méchants de ses enfants. Au lieu de les retirer du service de Dieu, il se comporta ordinairement envers eux alors qu'ils continuaient à profaner le temple de Dieu.  **\nPremier Samuel 2 verset 12, 17, 22 à 24  **\n12 Les fils d'Eli étaient fils de Bélial ; ils ne connaissaient pas le Seigneur.\n17 C'est pourquoi le péché des jeunes gens était très grand devant l'Éternel, car les hommes avaient en horreur l'offrande de l'Éternel.\n22 Or Éli était très vieux et avait entendu tout ce que ses fils avaient fait à tout Israël ; et comment ils couchèrent avec les femmes qui s'assemblaient à l'entrée du tabernacle d'assignation.\n23 Et il leur dit   Pourquoi faites-vous de telles choses ? car j'ai entendu parler de vos mauvaises actions par tout ce peuple. 24 Non, mes fils ! car ce n'est pas un bon rapport que j'entends; vous faites transgresser le peuple de l'Éternel.  **\nC'était une voix faible sans action. En raison de leur attitude fâcheuse, beaucoup ne venaient plus au temple pour rendre service à Dieu. C'est exactement ce qui se passe actuellement parmi les enfants des pasteurs. Le diable s'approche d'eux pour les remplir de tous les maux et causer du chagrin à leurs parents. Les enfants des pasteurs doivent savoir que le diable veut les utiliser pour faire honte à leurs parents et détruire leur ministère. En tant qu'enfant de pasteur, contribuez au ministère de vos parents par une vie pieuse et en résistant au diable. Évitez les amis maléfiques et ceux que le diable vous envoie pour atteindre son but. Résistez au diable et il vous fuira.  **\nJacques 4 verset 7  **\nSoumettez-vous donc à Dieu. Résistez au diable, et il fuira loin de vous.  **\n2.2 Exemples d'enfants qui ont fait leurs parents content  **\nLa Bible nous donne également un récit d'enfants qui ont rendu leurs parents heureux. Certains d'entre eux incluent les éléments suivants   **\n2.2.1 JOSEPH  **\nGenèse 37 verset 1 à 16  **\n1 Et Jacob habita dans le pays où son père était étranger, au pays de Canaan.\n2 Ce sont les générations de Jacob. Joseph, âgé de dix-sept ans, faisait paître le troupeau avec ses frères; et le garçon était avec les fils de Bilha et avec les fils de Zilpa , les femmes de son père; et Joseph rapporta à son père leur mauvaise nouvelle.\n3 Or Israël aimait Joseph plus que tous ses enfants, parce qu'il était le fils de sa vieillesse ; et il lui fit un manteau de plusieurs couleurs . 4 Et quand ses frères virent que leur père l'aimait plus que tous ses frères, ils le haïrent et ne purent lui parler paisiblement.\n5 Et Joseph fit un rêve, et il le raconta à ses frères ; et ils le haïrent encore plus. 6 Et il leur dit   Écoutez, je vous prie, ce songe que j'ai fait ;\n7 Car voici, nous liions des gerbes dans les champs, et voici, ma gerbe s'est levée, et elle aussi s'est tenue debout; et voici, vos gerbes se tenaient tout autour, et se prosternaient devant ma gerbe.\n8 Et ses frères lui dirent   Régneras-tu vraiment sur nous ? Ou bien domineras-tu sur nous ? Et ils le haïrent encore plus pour ses rêves et pour ses paroles.\n9 Et il fit encore un autre songe, et le raconta à ses frères, et dit   Voici, j'ai encore rêvé un songe ; et voici, le soleil, la lune et les onze étoiles m'ont obéi.\n10 Et il le raconta à son père et à ses frères ; et son père le reprit, et lui dit   Quel est ce songe que tu as fait ? Viendrons-nous vraiment, moi, ta mère et tes frères, nous prosterner devant toi jusqu'à terre ?\n11 Et ses frères l'enviaient; mais son père a observé le dicton. 12 Et ses frères allèrent paître le troupeau de leur père à Sichem.\n13 Et Israël dit à Joseph   Tes frères ne font-ils pas paître le troupeau à Sichem ? viens, et je t'enverrai vers eux. Et il lui dit   Me voici.\n14 Et il lui dit   Va, je te prie, voir si ça va bien avec tes frères, et bien avec les troupeaux ; et rapportez-moi encore un mot. Il le fit donc sortir de la vallée d'Hébron, et il vint à Sichem.\n15 Et un homme le trouva, et voici, il errait dans les champs, et l'homme l'interrogea, disant   Que cherches- tu ?\n16 Et il dit   Je cherche mes frères ; dis-moi, je te prie, où ils font paître leurs troupeaux.  **\nJoseph était un enfant de joie pour ses parents. Il a toujours fait preuve d'une attitude pieuse, ce qui lui a valu le manteau aux multiples couleurs de ses parents. C'était un garçon juste qui détestait l'iniquité. Il rapporta les actes impies de ses frères à leur père non pas en guise de critique mais pour leur salut. La piété de Joseph réjouit son père     **\nProverbes 23 verset 24, 25  **\n24 Le père du juste se réjouira beaucoup, et celui qui engendre un enfant sage se réjouira de lui.\n25 Ton père et ta mère se réjouiront, et celle qui t'a enfanté se réjouira.  **\nJeune homme, jeune femme, rendez vos parents heureux par votre caractère. Vivez un style de vie différent de celui des autres enfants de votre société et ne suivez pas la multitude pour commettre le péché. Soyez de Dieu, aimez Dieu et tout ce qui concerne Jésus-Christ. Soyez zélé dans l'église, servant Dieu.  **\nProverbes 24 verset 21  **\n21 Mon fils, crains l'Éternel et le roi, et ne te mêle pas de ceux qui sont adonnés au changement ;  **\nProverbes 23 verset 15 à 16  **\n15 Mon fils, si ton cœur est sage, mon cœur se réjouira, même le mien. 16 Oui, mes reins se réjouiront, quand tes lèvres prononcent des choses justes.  **\nNotez ce qui suit au sujet de la vie pieuse de Joseph  **\nGenèse 39 verset 5 à 12  **\n1 Et Joseph fut descendu en Égypte ; et Potiphar, officier de Pharaon, chef des gardes, un Égyptien, l'acheta des mains des Ismaélites , qui l'y avaient fait descendre.\n2 Et l'Éternel était avec Joseph, et c'était un homme prospère; et il était dans la maison de son maître l'Egyptien.\n3 Et son maître vit que l'Éternel était avec lui, et que l'Éternel faisait prospérer entre ses mains tout ce qu'il faisait.\n4 Et Joseph trouva grâce à ses yeux, et il le servit, et il l'établit sur sa maison, et il mit entre ses mains tout ce qu'il avait.\n5 Et il arriva, depuis qu'il l'eut établi sur sa maison et sur tout ce qui lui appartenait, que l'Éternel bénit la maison de l'Égyptien à cause de Joseph ; et la bénédiction de l'Éternel fut sur tout ce qu'il avait dans la maison et dans les champs.\n6 Et il laissa tout ce qu'il avait entre les mains de Joseph ; et il ne savait pas ce qu'il devait avoir, sauf le pain qu'il mangeait. Et Joseph était une bonne personne, et bien aimé.\n7 Et il arriva, après ces choses, que la femme de son maître jeta les yeux sur Joseph ; et elle dit   Couche avec moi. 8 Mais il refusa, et dit à la femme de son maître   Voici, mon maître ne sait pas ce qui est avec moi dans la maison, et il m'a confié tout ce qu'il a ;\n9 Il n'y a personne de plus grand dans cette maison que moi; et il ne m'a rien caché d'autre que toi, parce que tu es sa femme, comment puis-je faire ce grand mal et pécher contre Dieu ?\n10 Et il arriva, comme elle parlait à Joseph jour après jour, qu'il ne l'écoutait pas, pour coucher près d'elle, ou pour être avec elle.\n11 Et il arriva, à peu près à cette époque, que Joseph entra dans la maison pour faire ses affaires ; et il n'y avait là aucun des hommes de la maison à l'intérieur.\n12 Et elle le saisit par son vêtement, en disant   Couche avec moi ; et il laissa son vêtement dans sa main, et s'enfuit, et le fit sortir.  **\nD'après les versets ci-dessus, nous avons observé que   **\ni.\tLa faveur de Dieu était sur Joseph. Le Seigneur était avec lui.\nii.\tJoseph était un jeune travailleur et prospère.\niii.\tJoseph était une bénédiction partout où il était.\niv.\tJoseph était un jeune pieux qui craignait Dieu et haïssait le péché.\nv.\tJoseph a enduré la persécution et les difficultés sans se plaindre.\nvi.\tDieu l'a hautement exalté. Dieu le fera aussi pour vous, si vous apprenez à vivre une vie pieuse.  **\n2.2.2 RUT  **\nRuth, une belle-fille de Naomi a été élevée comme fille de Naomi avant la mort de son mari. Elle était jeune, pieuse, industrieuse et attentionnée. Elle s'est occupée de Naomi. Elle était si attentionnée que les gens pouvaient le voir et féliciter Naomi. Dans cet esprit, Naomi s'est intéressée à son mariage en lui indiquant quoi faire. Naomi a été impressionnée par son style de vie.  **\nRuth 3 verset 1 à 10  **\n1 Alors Naomi, sa belle-mère, lui dit   Ma fille, ne chercherai-je pas du repos pour toi, afin que tu sois bien ?\n2 Et maintenant Boaz n'est-il pas de notre parenté, avec les servantes de qui tu étais ? Voici, il vanne l'orge la nuit dans l' aire de battage .\n3 Lavez-vous donc, et oignez-vous, et mettez vos vêtements sur vous, et descendez à terre, mais ne vous faites pas connaître à l'homme, jusqu'à ce qu'il ait fini de manger et de boire.\n4 Et il arrivera, quand il se couchera, que tu marqueras l'endroit où il sera couché, et tu entreras, et découvriras ses pieds, et te coucheras; et il te dira ce que tu feras.\n5 Et elle lui dit   Tout ce que tu me diras, je le ferai. 6 Et elle descendit à l'étage, et fit selon tout ce que sa belle-mère lui ordonnait. 7 Et quand Boaz eut mangé et bu, et que son cœur était joyeux, il alla se coucher au bout du tas de blé et elle vint doucement, et découvrit ses pieds, et la coucha.\n8 Et il arriva, à minuit, que l'homme eut peur, et se retourna ; et voici, une femme était couchée à ses pieds. 9 Et il dit   Qui es-tu ? Et elle répondit  Je suis Ruth ta servante, étends donc ta jupe sur ta servante; car tu es un proche parent.\n10 Et il dit   Béni sois-tu du Seigneur, ma fille, car tu as montré plus de bonté à la fin qu'au début, car tu n'as pas suivi les jeunes hommes, qu'ils soient pauvres ou riches.  **\nC'est une chose courante dans le monde qu'il y ait des garçons qui enchantent les filles avec un pouvoir satanique, par l'intermédiaire d'herboristes ou (sorciers) pour piéger le sexe opposé. Nos femmes (en particulier les jeunes femmes) devraient apprendre de Ruth afin d'éviter la luxure juvénile. Ruth ne peut pas être piégée par cela. Pour que vous soyez victime du pouvoir satanique, vous devez être disponible pour que cela se produise. Ruth n'allait pas chasser les jeunes hommes à cause du mariage, même si elle s'était mariée auparavant et savait ce que c'était que de rencontrer un homme, pourtant, elle se maintenait toujours sous la sujétion dans la justice.  **\nRuth 4 verset 13 à 15  **\n13 Alors Boaz prit Ruth, et elle était sa femme , et quand il entra chez elle, le Seigneur lui donna la conception, et elle enfanta un fils.\n14 Et les femmes dirent à Naomi   Béni soit l'Éternel, qui ne t'a pas laissée aujourd'hui sans parent, afin que son nom soit célèbre en Israël. 15 Et il sera pour toi un restaurateur de ta vie, et un aliment de ta vieillesse pour ta belle-fille, qui t'aime, qui vaut mieux pour toi que sept fils qui lui sont nés.  **\nL'amour que Ruth déversait sur Naomi lui valait mieux que sept fils. Votre amour pour vos parents doit être un amour réconfortant et inconditionnel. Ce faisant, tu vaux mieux pour eux que sept fils. Un enfant béni en effet ! Les gens ont vu et ont pu témoigner de la façon dont Ruth aimait Naomi ; Est-ce qu'on peut témoigner de vous comme ça concernant vos parents ? Êtes-vous un amoureux de vos parents ou un troubleur d'eux? Dis de bonnes paroles à tes parents, remplis-les de la pensée d'un bel avenir à travers toi. Traitez vos parents avec un amour sincère et de la patience. Ne soyez pas comme Ham qui a vu la nudité de son père et s'est mis à rire. C'est gênant de le faire. Agissez plutôt comme Japhet et Sem, d'une manière honorable et révérencielle, et vous serez bénis.  **\nRuth 4 verset 20 à 22  **\n20 Et Amminadab engendra Nahshon, et Nahshon engendra Salmon, 21 et Salmon engendra Boaz, et Boaz engendra Obed,\n22 Et Obed engendra Jesse, et Jesse engendra David. De la lignée de David est venu Jésus. Voir l' honneur de Ruth. Elle est devenue l'une des arrière-grands-mères de Jésus ! Le véritable honneur et la grandeur de la vie viennent de Jésus.  **\n2.2.3 DAVID  **\nDavid était pieux et avait l'onction de Dieu sur lui. Il était jeune et avait la clé de la victoire d'Israël entre ses mains. Une chose qui était claire à propos de David était qu'il aimait le Seigneur avec ferveur. Il a composé tant de chansons pour la louange et l'adoration de Dieu. Son amour et son engagement envers Dieu ont provoqué tant d'amour de Dieu envers lui.  **\nJean 14 verset 23  **\n23 Jésus répondit et lui dit   Si quelqu'un m'aime, il gardera mes paroles ; et mon Père l'aimera, et nous irons à lui, et ferons notre demeure avec lui.  **\nDavid a gardé le commandement de Dieu et a été béni par Dieu. Il ne s'est pas engagé dans la musique ou les chansons mondaines comme le font les jeunes de nos jours. Au lieu de cela, il a utilisé son talent pour chanter des louanges à Dieu, son Créateur. En bref, Israël a appris tant de chansons de lui par l'onction de Dieu sur lui.   **\nActes 13 verset 22  **\n22 Et quand il l'eut destitué, il leur suscita David pour être leur roi; à qui aussi il rendit témoignage, et dit  J'ai trouvé David, fils d'Isaï, un homme selon mon coeur, qui accomplira toute ma volonté.  **\nDeuxième Samuel 23 verset 1 à 3  **\n1 Voici donc les dernières paroles de David. David, fils d'Isaï, dit, et l'homme élevé en haut, l'oint du Dieu de Jacob, et le doux psalmiste d'Israël, dit   2 L'Esprit de l'Éternel a parlé par moi, et sa parole a été dans ma langue.\n3 Le Dieu d'Israël a dit, le Rocher d'Israël m'a dit   Celui qui domine sur les hommes doit être juste, régnant dans la crainte de Dieu.  **\nC'était un homme vaillant, un guerrier. Dans sa jeunesse, il a vaincu Goliath et le peuple l'a applaudi, ainsi que ses parents, pour avoir élevé un enfant aussi vaillant.  **\nPremier Samuel 17 verset 55 à 58  **\n55 Et quand Saül vit David sortir contre le Philistin, il dit à Abner, chef de l'armée   Abner, de qui est ce jeune homme ? Et Abner dit   Tant que ton âme est vivante , ô roi, je ne saurais le dire.\n56 Et le roi dit   Demande à qui est le fils de l'adolescent.\n57 Et comme David revenait de la tuerie du Philistin, Abner le prit et l'amena devant Saül, la tête du Philistin dans sa main.\n58 Et Saül lui dit   De qui es-tu le fils, jeune homme ? Et David répondit  Je suis le fils de ton serviteur Isaï le Bethlémite.  **\nDavid a été bouleversé par la victoire, mais Saül était profondément intéressé à savoir de qui était le fils qui avait vaincu ce géant. Notez que lorsque vous faites du bien, les gens seront intéressés à vous connaître pour la joie et le bonheur de vos parents. Par conséquent, soyez un enfant bon et sage. Qui sait, vous pourriez être la solution aux problèmes de la nation demain !  **\nProverbes 23 verset 16, 19, 24  **\n16 Oui, mes reins se réjouiront, quand tes lèvres prononcent des choses justes. 19 Écoute, mon fils, et sois sage, et guide ton cœur dans le chemin.\n24 Le père du juste se réjouira beaucoup, et celui qui engendre un enfant sage se réjouira de lui.  **\nProverbes 27 verset 11  **\n11 Mon fils, sois sage et réjouis mon cœur, afin que je réponde à celui qui m'insulte .  **\nDavid reste toujours une source d'inspiration pour le monde d'aujourd'hui dans les Écritures. Vivez une vie pieuse et soyez une source d'inspiration pour l'humanité.  **\n2.2.4 ESTHER  **\nEsther était une enfant obéissante qui a soumis la direction de sa vie à ses parents. C'était une dame qui n'appréciait pas l'utilisation de cosmétiques pour la beauté artificielle. Son esprit obéissant l'a récompensée avec la position la plus élevée parmi les femmes. Elle est devenue la reine du royaume, le peuple de son mari a prospéré et son peuple a connu un grand salut et une grande délivrance grâce à elle.  **\nEsther 2 verset 8 à 9, 15  **\n8 Ainsi il arriva, lorsque l'ordre du roi et son décret furent entendus, et que de nombreuses jeunes filles furent rassemblées à Suse, le palais, sous la garde d'Hégaï, qu'Esther fut aussi amenée à la maison du roi, sous la garde d' Hégaï . , gardien des femmes.\n9 Et la jeune fille lui plut, et elle obtint de lui sa bonté ; et il lui donna rapidement des choses pour la purification, avec ce qui lui appartenait, et sept jeunes filles, qui devaient lui être données, de la maison du roi  et il la préféra, elle et ses servantes, au meilleur endroit de la maison de les femmes.\n15 Or, lorsque le tour d'Esther, fille d' Abihaïl , l'oncle de Mardochée, qui l'avait prise pour sa fille, fut venue pour entrer chez le roi, elle ne demanda rien d'autre que ce qu'Hégaï , le chambellan du roi, le gardien des femmes, nommé. Et Esther obtint faveur aux yeux de tous ceux qui la regardaient.  **\nLes matériaux qu'Esther utilisait pour son habillement et sa parure n'étaient pas ceux que les femmes pécheresses utilisaient pour leur beauté cosmétique. Esther a choisi de vivre naturellement et a préféré la gloire de Dieu qui a suivi la beauté intérieure.    **\nPremier Pierre 1 verset 3 à 5  **\n3 Béni soit le Dieu et Père de notre Seigneur Jésus Christ, qui, selon son abondante miséricorde, nous a régénérés pour une vive espérance par la résurrection de Jésus Christ d'entre les morts,\n4 À un héritage incorruptible, sans souillure et qui ne flétrit pas, qui vous est réservé dans les cieux,\n5 Qui sont gardés par la puissance de Dieu par la foi pour le salut prêt à être révélé dans les derniers temps.     **\nLa gloire du Seigneur la couvrit énormément. En raison de son apparence naturelle, elle a reçu la faveur divine . C'est parce qu'elle a reçu une bonne formation à domicile. Elle était soumise aux instructions de Mardochée sans arguments.  **\nProverbes 1 verset 8  **\n8 Mon fils, écoute l'instruction de ton père, et n'abandonne pas la loi de ta mère  **\nProverbes 4 verset 9  **\n9 Elle donnera à ta tête un ornement de grâce, une couronne de gloire qu'elle te remettra.  **\nEsther a maintenu l'esprit d'obéissance parentale, même jusqu'à son mariage. Cela a apporté bénédiction et délivrance à elle et à son peuple.  **\nEsther 2 verset 20  **\nEsther n'avait pas encore montré sa parenté ni son peuple ; comme Mardochée le lui avait ordonné, car Esther exécuta le commandement de Mardochée, comme lorsqu'elle avait été élevée avec lui.  **\nCertaines personnes aiment discuter avec leurs parents et leurs pasteurs, même si ce qu'on leur enseigne est clairement tiré des Écritures. Certains enfants sont difficiles à corriger. Ils sentent qu'ils savent déjà tout, à cause de leur fierté. Dieu prive de telles personnes de la vraie connaissance.  **\nProverbes 26 verset 16  **\nLe paresseux est plus sage dans sa propre vanité que sept hommes qui peuvent rendre une raison.  **\nLuc 10 verset 1 à 24  **\n1 Après ces choses, le Seigneur en désigna encore soixante-dix autres, et les envoya deux par deux devant sa face dans toutes les villes et tous les lieux où il viendrait lui-même.\n2 C'est pourquoi il leur dit  La moisson est vraiment grande, mais les ouvriers sont peu nombreux  priez donc le maître de la moisson d'envoyer des ouvriers dans sa moisson. 3 Allez, voici, je vous envoie comme des agneaux parmi les loups. 4 Ne portez ni bourse, ni sac, ni souliers et ne saluez personne en chemin.\n5 Et dans quelque maison que vous entriez, dites d'abord   Paix à cette maison. 6 Et si le fils de la paix est là, ta paix reposera sur lui ; sinon, il reviendra vers vous.\n7 Et demeurez dans la même maison, mangeant et buvant ce qu'ils donnent, car l' ouvrier est digne de son salaire. N'allez pas de maison en maison. 8 Et dans quelque ville que vous entriez, et qu'on vous reçoive, mangez ce qui est mis devant vous ;\n9 Et guérissez les malades qui s'y trouveront, et dites-leur   Le royaume de Dieu s'est approché de vous.\n10 Mais dans quelque ville que vous entriez, et qu'on ne vous reçoive pas, sortez dans les rues de celle-ci, et dites  \n11 Même la poussière même de votre ville, qui fend parce que vos noms sont écrits dans les cieux.\n21 A cette heure-là, Jésus se réjouit en esprit, et dit   Je te rends grâces, ô Père, Seigneur du ciel et de la terre, de ce que tu as caché ces choses aux sages et aux prudents, et que tu les as révélées aux enfants ; ainsi, Père ; car ainsi cela paraissait bon à Tes yeux.\n22 Toutes choses m'ont été données par mon Père, et personne ne connaît qui est le Fils, si ce n'est le Père ; et qui est le Père, sinon le Fils, et celui à qui le Fils le révélera.\n23 Et il le retourna vers ses disciples, et dit en privé   Heureux les yeux qui voient les choses que vous voyez ;\n24 Car je vous dis que beaucoup de prophètes et de rois ont désiré voir les choses que vous voyez, et ne les ont pas vues ; et d'entendre ces choses que vous entendez, et que vous ne les avez pas entendues.  **\nLes versets ci-dessus montrent la réalité et/ou la possibilité de l'entêtement de l'homme, en particulier des enfants ou des jeunes, que Satan pourrait endurcir leur cœur contre la vérité ou la parole de Dieu. C'est dangereux, car le jugement de Dieu sur de tels jeunes ou enfants récalcitrants sera douloureux, car ils entendent la vérité et endurcissent leurs cœurs.  **\nEsther était une femme humble. C'est pourquoi elle s'est élevée au rang de reine. Elle n'apparaissait pas nue comme beaucoup de femmes le font aujourd'hui. Elle était obéissante et soumise à ses parents et à la parole de Dieu. C'est exactement ce qui définit la grandeur d'une personne. Dieu a déterminé le mari qu'Esther devait épouser selon le plan que Dieu avait pour elle. Dieu a une personne convenable pour vous marier selon Sa volonté. Si vous êtes humble et obéissant comme Esther, vous rencontrerez votre conjoint à l'heure convenue.  **\nJérémie 29 verset 11 à 13  **\n11 Car je connais les pensées que j'ai à votre égard, dit le Seigneur, des pensées de paix et non de mal, pour vous donner une fin attendue.\n12 Alors vous m'invoquerez, et vous irez me prier, et je vous exaucerai.\n13 Et vous me chercherez et vous me trouverez, quand vous me chercherez de tout votre cœur.  **\nBeaucoup de garçons et de filles gâchent leur destin par un mariage impie qui est en dehors du plan de Dieu. Soyez comme Esther. Mariez-vous dans la volonté de Dieu et bénissez votre vie, votre famille, votre société, l'église et le monde entier !  **\n2.2.5 TIMOTHY  **\nLa vie de Timothy est un modèle pour les jeunes qui désirent entrer dans le ministère et y réussir. C'était un enfant éduquable. Il était un gentil garçon pour son père et un assistant pour l'apôtre Paul dans le ministère. Après le ministère de Paul, il a continué l'œuvre de Dieu en tant que son successeur.  **\nDeuxième Timothée 1 verset 5 à 6  **\n5 Quand j'appellerai au souvenir la foi sincère qui est en toi, qui a d'abord habité ta grand-mère Loïs et ta mère Eunice ; et je suis persuadé qu'en toi aussi.\n6 C'est pourquoi je te rappelle de réveiller le don de Dieu qui est en toi par l'imposition de mes mains.  **\nLa famille s'est soumise à Dieu et au ministère de Paul. Paul a témoigné de la formation pieuse inculquée à Timothée par ses parents. Il l'a vu comme un cadeau et un trésor qui l'aidera à stimuler son travail ministériel.  **\nPhilippiens 2 verset 19 à 22  **\n19 Mais je compte sur le Seigneur Jésus pour vous envoyer bientôt Timothée, afin que moi aussi je sois d'une bonne consolation, quand je connaîtrai votre état.\n20 Car je n'ai pas d'homme aux vues similaires, qui se soucie naturellement de votre état.\n21 Car tous cherchent ce qui leur est propre, non les choses qui sont à Jésus-Christ. 22 Mais vous connaissez la preuve de lui, que, comme un fils avec le père, il a servi avec moi dans l'évangile.  **\nPaul a dit, Timothée était unique même parmi les autres. Il était complètement soumis. Il était très préoccupé par les affaires de Jésus. Il était zélé pour les choses de Jésus. Il s'y est entièrement livré. Nous recherchons des personnes comme celle-ci qui sont pleinement engagées et dévouées à l'œuvre de Dieu dans la justice et la vérité. Il connaissait parfaitement les doctrines de la vérité, de la justice et de la sainteté.  **\n 2 Timothée 3 versets 15 à 17  **\n15 Et que, dès ton enfance, tu connais les saintes écritures, qui peuvent te rendre sage à salut par la foi qui est en Jésus-Christ.\n16 Toute Ecriture est inspirée de Dieu, et utile pour enseigner, pour convaincre, pour corriger, pour instruire dans la justice;\n17 Afin que l'homme de Dieu soit parfait, entièrement pourvu à toutes les bonnes œuvres.  **\nTimothée était un exemple d'une vie de justice et de sainteté pour les autres. (jeunes et moins jeunes)  **\nPremier Timothée 4 verset 12  **\n12 Que personne ne méprise ta jeunesse; mais sois un exemple pour les croyants, en parole, en conversation, en charité, en esprit, en foi, en pureté.  **\nDes gens comme Timothée sont très nécessaires pour le réveil de la sainteté à la fin des temps dans le monde entier   les jeunes hommes et femmes en Christ qui prêcheront la vérité et seront un exemple de piété pratique sont nécessaires pour l'œuvre de Dieu.  **\nDeutéronome 30 verset 15 à 20  **\n15 Vois, j'ai mis devant toi aujourd'hui la vie et le bien, la mort et le mal ;\n16 En ce que je te commande aujourd'hui d'aimer le Seigneur, ton Dieu, de marcher dans ses voies, et de garder ses commandements, ses statuts et ses ordonnances, afin que tu vives et que tu multiplies ; et l'Éternel, ton Dieu, te bénira dans le pays où tu vas le posséder.\n17 Mais si ton coeur se détourne, de sorte que tu n'entendes pas, mais que tu sois attiré, et que tu adores d'autres dieux, et que tu les serves;\n18 Je vous déclare aujourd'hui que vous périrez sûrement et que vous ne prolongerez pas vos jours sur le pays où vous passerez le Jourdain pour aller le posséder.\n19 J'appelle le ciel et la terre à enregistrer ce jour contre toi, que j'ai mis devant toi la vie et la mort, la bénédiction et la malédiction ; Choisis donc la vie, afin que toi et ta postérité puissiez vivre.\n20 afin que tu aimes le Seigneur, ton Dieu, et que tu obéisses à sa voix, et que tu t'attaches à lui; car il est ta vie et la durée de tes jours, afin que tu habites dans le pays que l'Éternel a juré à tes pères, Abraham, Isaac et Jacob, de leur donner.  **\nLe résumé de tout cela pour les enfants et les jeunes est le suivant   le Seigneur a mis devant vous aujourd'hui le bien et le mal, la bénédiction et la malédiction, la vie et la mort. Sur le côté droit se trouvent   l'obéissance à Dieu, la soumission aux parents, leur faire du bien, les rendre heureux et la vie éternelle à la fin. Sur le côté gauche se trouvent   le mal, la malédiction, la méchanceté, l'entêtement, la rébellion, la mort et l'enfer à la fin. Cependant, si vous voulez continuer dans votre style de vie méchant, le choix vous appartient et la décision vous appartient. Mais je vous conseille de choisir le bien, la bénédiction et la vie afin que les gens puissent dire du bien de vous et que l'église, vos parents et la société puissent être touchés positivement et richement par votre vie pieuse. Amen.\n",

Les enseignements vivants du contenu de ce livre transformeront tant de foyers chrétiens avec de grands témoignages abondants.

Obtenir et appliquer la bonne connaissance de celui-ci peut faire une maison, un paradis sur terre et promouvoir votre vie chrétienne et votre témoignage. La bible dit   « ….ajoutez à votre foi, la connaissance. Deuxième Pierre 1 verset 5. La foi seule ne suffit pas pour gérer les problèmes touchant à ces domaines de la vie ; par conséquent, il est très important d'acquérir des connaissances à leur sujet ; pas n'importe quelles connaissances, les bonnes connaissances. Tant de couples chrétiens ont pris et pris de mauvaises décisions en raison des mauvais enseignements qu'ils ont reçus à leur sujet, de sorte que beaucoup d'entre eux, plutôt que de profiter, endurent leur mariage et certains se sont séparés, divorcés ou même remariés.\nIl est dangereux d'obtenir des connaissances de bébés, c'est-à-dire ceux qui ne sont pas mûrs dans la parole de Dieu, à moitié cuits ou ceux qui interprètent mal la parole de Dieu. Vous devez obtenir la connaissance, pour ajouter à votre foi, de la part de serviteurs de Dieu mûrs, qui sont exercés dans le plein évangile et qui partagent correctement la Parole de vérité. Celles-ci sont établies sur les Écritures et la vérité donne la vie éternelle.   **\n\n\nMatthieu 28 verset 20   **\nEnseignez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai commandé, et voici, je suis toujours avec vous, même jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amen.\"  **\n\nMalachie 2 verset 4 à 7   **\n4 « Et vous saurez que je vous ai envoyé ce commandement, afin que mon alliance soit avec Lévi, dit l'Éternel des armées. \n5\tMon alliance était avec lui de vie et de paix; et je les lui ai donnés parce qu'il me craignait et craignait devant mon nom.\n6\tLa loi de la vérité était dans sa bouche, et l'iniquité n'a pas été trouvée dans ses lèvres   il a marché avec moi dans la paix et l'équité, et a détourné beaucoup de l'iniquité.\n7\tCar les lèvres du sacrificateur doivent garder la connaissance, et ils doivent rechercher la loi de sa bouche, car il est le messager de l'Éternel des armées.  **\nIci, on nous dit que nous devons enseigner tout ce que le Seigneur nous a commandé. L'Écriture nous dit que toutes les choses essentielles à la vie et à la piété nous ont déjà été données (deuxième Pierre 1 verset 3), et c'est la responsabilité du prêtre qui connaît Dieu, d'avoir la parole de vérité, la parole de sagesse et compréhension, afin que les gens puissent venir lui demander la pensée de Dieu. Les gens devraient s'enquérir de la pensée de Dieu auprès du prêtre/homme de Dieu qui partage à juste titre la parole de vérité.\nQuelle est la raison pour laquelle il y a des différences dans la doctrine et dans les interprétations dans les églises du Christ aujourd'hui ? La Bible nous dit en   **\nHébreux 5 verset 13 à 14 . \n« Car quiconque utilise du lait est inhabile à prononcer la parole de justice, car c'est un bébé. 14 Mais la nourriture forte appartient à ceux qui sont majeurs, même à ceux qui, par l'usage, ont exercé leurs sens à discerner le bien et le mal. Il y a des gens qui sont des bébés et qui ne seront pas capables d'apporter la vérité telle qu'elle est ; ils ne pourront pas clairement diviser la parole de vérité. Ce ne sont pas des bébés parce qu'ils viennent de naître de nouveau, mais parce qu'ils sont loin derrière dans la pratique de la parole de sainteté et de vérité. Ce n'est pas l'âge ni la taille de leur congrégation, mais combien de Dieu ils connaissent \"Celui qui a mes commandements et qui les garde, c'est celui qui m'aime  (et me connaît).\" (Jean 14 verset 21). La connaissance de Dieu est dans la parole et la pratique de la parole. Les gens qui n'ont pas beaucoup de connaissance de la parole, et certaines personnes qui se contentent de choisir un domaine de la parole de Dieu et de se spécialiser dessus mais qui ne connaissent pas beaucoup d'autres domaines de la parole de Dieu, sont tous des bébés. Ils peuvent s'en prendre à la guérison et à la majeure, ou à la délivrance ou à la prospérité et à la majeure. Qu'en est-il des autres domaines de la vie sur la sainteté, sur les questions de justice, les questions de vérité, les restitutions ? Ils n'en sont pas conscients et ne pratiquent pas ces autres domaines, c'est parce qu'ils ne sont pas conscients de la plénitude de la vérité. S'ils ne sont pas conscients de la plénitude de la vérité, ils ne peuvent pas pratiquer la plénitude de la vie et ils ne peuvent pas connaître Dieu. Ce sont des bébés. Et quand ceux-ci évoquent des idées, des interprétations, fabriquent des doctrines, ils ne peuvent pas arriver à la vérité. Combien plus de domaines qui sont difficiles, qui nécessitent un exercice de l'esprit ; ils ne peuvent rien sortir. Et c'est pourquoi vous voyez la confusion et la division dans les églises de Christ. Mais la Bible dit que ceux qui sont habitués à la nourriture forte, qui l'ont apprise et la pratiquent, ont le cœur exercé à discerner. Ils peuvent facilement entendre et comprendre; ils peuvent entendre et dire cela. Pourquoi? Ils ont été calqués sur cela. Ainsi, nous ne sommes pas touchés par les révélations, nous sommes établis sur les Écritures, la vérité donne la vie éternelle et non la révélation. Toute révélation qui contredit l'Écriture n'est pas la voix de Dieu ou bien ce sont ces bébés qui ont peut-être vu une vraie révélation mais qui n'ont pas l'interprétation. Pourquoi? Ce sont des bébés. \"Car quiconque utilise du lait est inhabile à prononcer la parole de justice, car c'est un bébé.\" Hébreux 5 verset 13 .  **\nQuand quelqu'un, parce qu'il ou elle a reçu une révélation de ou de Jésus, sent ou pense qu'il ou elle est maintenant une autorité dans la doctrine chrétienne, cette personne est un bébé et ses auditeurs qui pensent aussi de même, que la personne est maintenant une autorité dans la doctrine chrétienne, sont aussi des bébés. Parce qu'il faut du temps pour étudier et devenir une autorité dans un domaine. Ce n'est pas un rêve d'un jour. Pour que quelqu'un puisse être qualifié de docteur en philosophie, il n'est pas allé à l'école pendant deux ou même cinq ans. Il a été dans le domaine de l'apprentissage pendant plus de dix ans. Vous ne pouvez pas le comparer (qui a étudié pendant plus de dix ans) dans la connaissance avec quelqu'un qui vient de rêver hier, ou quelqu'un qui vient d'obtenir son diplôme hier. Vous ne pouvez pas comparer un docteur en philosophie de la connaissance avec quelqu'un qui dit avoir découvert un livre hier. Qu'il ait découvert un livre ne fait-il pas de lui une grande autorité ? A-t-il seulement compris ce qui est écrit sur ce livre ? La compréhension prend du temps à se développer; il se métamorphose, parce que « Quand j'étais enfant, je parlais comme un enfant, je comprenais comme un enfant, je pensais comme un enfant   mais quand je suis devenu un homme, j'ai rangé les choses enfantines. 1 Corinthiens 13 verset 11.  **\n\nJ'ai lu ce livre mais j'ai pensé comme un enfant. Quand je suis devenu adulte, je suis allé à ce livre et j'ai raisonné dessus en tant qu'homme. Votre cerveau doit mûrir. Comment penserez-vous que parce que quelqu'un a reçu une révélation, Jésus l'a emmené au ciel ou en enfer, vous êtes dispersé au point que si vous cherchez la vérité, c'est cette personne seule qui vous donnera la vérité ? Vous êtes hors cours. Le Seigneur ne mettra pas Son secret de vérité sur de telles personnes parce que il y a d'abord les apôtres. \"Et Dieu a établi dans l'église, les premiers apôtres...\" (1 Corinthiens 12 verset 28). Les gens qui se sont exercés à ces choses, les ont suivis, les ont appris et les ont compris. Je dis cela pour que vous ne permettiez à aucune révélation non vérifiée de disperser vos vies. Pas parce que vous voulez aller au ciel, alors vous demandez aux gens qui ont eu ces révélations de vous dire quelle est la prochaine chose ou ce que Jésus a dit ensuite ? Nous ne voulons pas former les chrétiens à être ce type de personnes, car tout ce que Jésus a à dire a déjà été dit dans la Bible, ces autres sont des confirmations juste pour nous fortifier selon la sagesse divine.  **\n\nPar conséquent, sur les questions touchant au sujet de ce livre, obtenez vos connaissances auprès d'hommes et de femmes de Dieu compétents et expérimentés. C'est pourquoi ce livre est écrit pour vous donner de vraies connaissances sur ces sujets. Obtenez-le directement de la bonne source et pas de n'importe qui afin que votre vie ne soit pas éparpillée par des informations trompeuses. Puisse le Seigneur vous guider dans votre lecture de ces questions sensibles telles qu'elles sont présentées dans ce livre.  **\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\nChapitre deux   Sexualité ou faire l'amour entre mari et femme   **\nNous allons considérer la sexualité/faire l'amour dans le mariage dans une perspective biblique. C'est un vaste sujet en soi, mais l'accent est mis ici sur la sainteté, la vérité et la perfection, afin que ce domaine n'affecte pas votre vie chrétienne. L'accent et le but de tout ce qui sera considéré ici est la sainteté. Paul a dit  «Ceux que nous prêchons, avertissant tout homme et enseignant tout homme en toute sagesse…» Quel est le but ? « …afin que nous présentions tout homme parfait en Jésus-Christ. (Colossiens 1 verset 28). Le Seigneur nous a choisis, le Seigneur avait prévu dès le début que nous serons utilisés par lui, et c'est pourquoi nous devons être fortifiés et ne négliger aucun effort pour obtenir la connaissance de la vérité car la vérité est une arme.  **\n  \nConseil divin sur les bonnes et les mauvaises attitudes en matière de sexualité   **\nProverbes 5 versets 18 à 19\n« Que ta fontaine soit bénie, et réjouis-toi avec la femme de ta jeunesse.\nQu'elle soit comme une biche aimante et un chevreuil agréable ; laisse ses seins te satisfaire à tout moment ; et sois toujours ravie de son amour.  **\nC'est parler à l'homme, bien sûr à la fois à l'homme et à la femme, car il s'agit d'amour. Libère ton cœur pour aimer ta femme. Sans un cœur libéré pour aimer cette femme, la sexualité/l'amour sera affecté ; le plaisir en sera affecté, cela peut affecter un ou les deux partenaires. Ainsi dit le Seigneur, cette femme que vous avez pour épouse est bénie et un don de Dieu, \"Quiconque trouve une femme, trouve une bonne chose, et obtient la faveur de l'Éternel » (Proverbes 18 verset 22). S'il vous plaît, laissez votre femme être bénie, bénissez-la tout le temps, soyez heureuse avec elle, aimez-la, prenez soin d'elle et appréciez son corps. Le Seigneur, qui a dit ces choses, connaît la taille des femmes, que certaines ont de petits corps, certaines, bien sûr, ont des corps de taille moyenne et certaines sont vraiment grosses, mais ce n'est pas l'intérêt de Dieu. Il a dit que votre femme, qui qu'elle soit, est bénie, elle est un don de Dieu. Travaillez sur votre cœur pour accepter cette vérité.   **\n « Laissez ta source soit bénie, et réjouis-toi avec la femme de ta jeunesse. Réjouis-toi, ne garde pas un visage renfrogné, ne sois pas dur en face et ne lui parle pas avec colère. Cela affectera l'amour/la sexualité en elle parce que vous serez une terreur pour elle et son corps ne vous répondra pas. Aussi sucrée que soit la soupe, si vous la mangez par contrainte , vous ne connaîtrez jamais sa douceur. Vous avez besoin de liberté, vous avez besoin de liberté, vous avez besoin de vous détendre pour manger et connaître la douceur d'une chose. Quand il y a toujours des querelles, des bagarres, des critiques, la sexualité est affectée. C'est une question délicate. Quand il y a un langage grossier ou un visage dur d'une femme, le corps de l'homme se refroidira, il n'aura plus de force. L'émotion suscitée doit être maintenue et puisque c'est une émotion, elle peut facilement mourir. C'est pourquoi la sainteté, la droiture, l'amour, la vérité jouent un rôle important dans la sexualité conjugale/faire l'amour.  **\n\n« Qu'elle soit comme une biche aimante et un chevreuil agréable ; que ses seins te satisfassent à tout moment ». Cette écriture montre donc que, toi, femme, tu dois libérer tout ton corps. Ne restreignez pas votre mari; permettez-lui d'accéder à n'importe quelle partie de votre corps qui le satisfera, parce que Dieu veut la satisfaction de cet homme, et quelle que soit la partie de votre corps qui donnera satisfaction à l'homme, donnez-lui accès. De même homme, Dieu veut la satisfaction de cette femme. Donnez-lui accès à la partie de votre corps qui lui donnera satisfaction. Nous avons eu un séminaire sur le mariage il y a de nombreuses années et le problème d'une femme, dans ce séminaire, était qu'elle ne connaissait pas l'organe sexuel de son mari. Selon elle, ils se rencontraient toujours dans l'obscurité et comme elle ne pouvait pas regarder là-bas, elle ne l'avait jamais vu. Ils ne prennent pas leur bain ensemble, ne vont même pas aux toilettes pour voir à quoi ressemble son mari. Cela la dérangeait et c'est devenu son souci. Elle veut savoir à quoi ressemble cette chose mais elle n'y a pas accès, car l'homme dirait toujours que la lumière doit être éteinte. S'il vous plaît, donnez-vous la liberté. Il n'y a pas de patron dans ce domaine. Nous mangeons de la nourriture; vous voulez savoir qui est le plus ancien en alimentation? L'ancienneté ne compte pas pour manger de la nourriture; tout le monde a un estomac qui a faim. C'est donc ce que la parole de Dieu nous dit.  **\n\n« Qu'elle soit comme une biche aimante et un chevreuil agréable ; laisse ses seins te satisfaire à tout moment ; et sois ravie toujours de son amour . \"Laissez-la\" dans votre cœur, entraînez-vous à voir la douceur de votre femme; prêchez-vous. Le diable ne voudra pas que vous voyiez la douceur de votre femme. Il a de nombreuses raisons pour lesquelles vous devriez la rejeter et il a de nombreuses raisons de vous donner pourquoi vous êtes meilleur et supérieur à elle. N'acceptez pas cela. Suivez le chemin de Dieu qui chérit la femme. Cette femme est une âme, une âme précieuse. Quelle âme est plus grosse qu'une autre ? C'est le corps que vous voyez, pas l'âme. L'âme est le délice du grand Dieu. De la même manière femme, travaille ton cœur et ne méprise pas ton mari dans ton cœur comme Mical l'a fait à David. Satan voudra que vous méprisiez cet homme et vous donnera de nombreuses raisons pour lesquelles vous devriez le mépriser. Si vous faites cela, c'est à votre mal parce qu'au fur et à mesure que vous faites votre lit, vous vous allongez dessus ; cette eau qui est calme, ayant un sommet propre, que vous voulez remuer en boue, est la même eau que vous boirez ; cette mauvaise attitude que vous avez envers cet homme affectera votre sexualité/faire l'amour. Pauvre toi, tu ne prends pas plaisir à faire l'amour, que Dieu a précieusement donné en cadeau à l'humanité. Pourquoi? Vous avez permis à Satan de s'interposer entre vous et votre mari. Vous avez permis aux mauvaises pensées de gouverner votre cœur. Vous vous êtes permis d'avoir un visage dur qui n'a aucune joie, aucun plaisir et donc ne remue personne.  **\n\nSoyez satisfait de son amour, ne pensez jamais à une autre femme. S'il vous plaît, lorsque vous faites l'amour avec votre femme, ne dites pas ou ne pensez même pas   « J'ai plus de plaisir quand j'imagine cela, je suis avec l'autre femme ». C'est le péché, vous commettez l'adultère. « La pensée de la folie est un péché ….. » (Proverbes 24 verset 9). C'est de l'injustice et toute injustice est un péché. Qu'est-ce qui vous fait imaginer une autre personne ? C'est un mensonge, c'est le mensonge du Diable. Refuser cette imagination de quelqu'un d'autre. Votre imagination de vous être avec un autre homme quand votre mari vient vers vous est un péché. Ce plaisir que vous recevez est un plaisir de tromperie et vous en rendrez compte. Ce n'est pas ainsi que Dieu a créé la sexualité/faire l'amour. Il n'est pas pur, combattez-le, résistez-lui, allez contre lui. Et certains d'entre vous ont été très sauvages quand ils étaient pécheurs. Vous étiez sauvage dans la sexualité; vous avez commis l'immoralité sexuelle jusqu'au ciel, votre dossier a été entendu en Amérique, vous avez voyagé dans de nombreux pays commettant l'immoralité sexuelle, mais maintenant, Dieu merci, la miséricorde est venue et vous êtes né de nouveau. Ne vous attendez pas à ce que votre mari soit comme les nombreux hommes qui vous ont traversé. Ne vous attendez pas à ce qu'il atteigne ce niveau. Non! Travaillez sur vous-même et priez pour la grâce. C'est comme quelqu'un qui a été un homme d'affaires qui fait des contrats par millions ici et là et puis une circonstance lui est arrivée, son entreprise a échoué et maintenant il fait un travail salarié où à la fin du mois ils ont mis quelque chose de petit dans son main. Vous savez qu'une telle personne dira, est-ce moi qui reçois cette chose ? Travaillez votre cœur, votre corps et votre esprit et appréciez-le. Homme, ta femme innocente maintenant dans la droiture et la sainteté ne peut pas être aussi brutale que ces prostituées que tu allais. Certains d'entre eux ont consommé de la drogue pour rendre leur corps tel qu'il est et vous pensez que votre femme devrait pouvoir se maquiller comme les prostituées qui suivent une formation pour leur entreprise ? Vous vous plaignez qu'elle est censée être comme ceci ou comme cela. Revenez à la compréhension, vous n'êtes plus dans ce monde. Descendez dans le monde de la justice et de la sainteté et recevez comme le Seigneur vous y donne. « Le peu que possède un juste vaut mieux que les richesses de plusieurs méchants. » (Psaume. 37 verset 16). Ce que tu ressens n'est pas plein, parce que tu en as vu de plus grands, est le meilleur parce que ta conscience est libre.  **\n\nLe sexe est une provision divine , c'est Dieu qui l'a donné. C'est un mystère divin et nous ne pouvons pas l'imaginer. Comment se fait-il que vous (couple marié) vivez ensemble et que vous ayez des relations sexuelles depuis tout ce temps et que vous ne soyez toujours pas satisfaits ? C'est un vrai mystère. Vous regardez le corps privé de votre femme depuis combien d'années maintenant, mais vous n'en avez pas encore fini. C'est une formation dont vous n'êtes pas diplômé; c'est nouveau à chaque fois. La chose a l'air neuve à chaque fois, c'est un mystère. Encore une fois, le sexe est donné pour l'intimité. C'est le dessein de Dieu qu'il puisse y avoir une telle intimité corporelle, une proximité et une chaleur qui donnent au cœur paix et plaisir. Lorsqu'elle est bien pratiquée, le cœur est joyeux, le cœur est heureux, et il y a une sorte de puissance dans l'homme qui le déroute de telle sorte que s'il ne se contrôle pas, il commencera à y faire beaucoup de promesses ; c'est un mystère pour l'intimité.  **\n\nLe sexe sert aussi à procréer/avoir des enfants. C'est la méthode que Dieu a donnée pour procréer. Encore une fois , c'est pour la protection,\n\"Néanmoins, pour éviter la fornication, que chaque homme ait sa propre femme, et que chaque femme ait son propre mari.\" (1 Corinthiens 7 verset 2). Il vous protégera du péché, il vous protégera de la maladie et il vous protégera de la mort, car beaucoup en sont morts. C'est pour se protéger. Ensuite, c'est pour le plaisir. Ecclésiaste 9 verset 9 « Vis joyeusement avec la femme que tu aimes tous les jours de la vie de ta vanité, qu'il t'a donnée sous le soleil, tous les jours de ta vanité, car c'est ta part dans cette vie et dans ton travail qui tu prends sous le soleil. Vivez joyeusement. Allez et priez pour que cela se produise. Peut-être que votre tradition vous a affecté, allez vous perdre de cette tradition et suivez la voie biblique. Peut-être que dans votre tribu, votre tradition ne reconnaît pas la femme, elle est une propriété. Entrez simplement en elle et passez votre chemin; quand tu en as fini avec elle, tu lui dis de bouger. Non, il ne devrait pas en être ainsi. Il devrait y avoir de la joie à traiter avec cette femme, la joie et le bonheur devraient être là. La femme devrait voir quelqu'un excité devant elle, elle devrait voir quelqu'un béni et elle devrait voir quelqu'un reconnaissant. Cela la rend bénie, cela la rend accomplie quelque chose, elle a un ministère dans la maison et ce ministère prospère. C'est comme ça que ça devrait être - joyeusement. Si vous ne vivez pas pleinement avec cette femme et que vous mourez, elle le regrettera. \"Mon mari ne m'a pas satisfaite\" sera sa préoccupation après votre mort. Si vous ne vous abandonnez pas entièrement à cet homme et qu'il vous arrive de mourir avant cet homme ; ce vide que vous avez créé lui fera sentir que vous lui avez fait du mal, même après votre mort. Pourquoi veux-tu ça? Tu es en vie; une seule vie, donne le meilleur que tu peux à ta femme; donner le meilleur que vous pouvez à votre mari. Une seule vie que lorsque vous partirez, comme Tabitha, votre mari suscitera vos bonnes œuvres telles quelles, passionnément dans son cœur. Votre femme suscitera vos bonnes œuvres telles qu'elles sont, passionnément dans son cœur. Par conséquent, changez à partir d'aujourd'hui et allez faire la bonne chose, allez et soyez un bon conjoint sexuellement.  **\n \n \nMéthode de faire l'amour   **\nIl n'y a pas de méthode scripturaire décrite pour faire l'amour. Dieu est l'auteur des variétés comme nous le voyons dans toute sa création ; les aliments, les fruits, les êtres humains eux-mêmes, les animaux et les couleurs ; il est le Dieu des variétés. On dit que la variété est le piment de la vie ; c'est notre Dieu. Il n'y a pas de méthode précise donnée dans les Écritures, mais quelle que soit la méthode qui vous donne du plaisir, qui lui donne du plaisir, peut être explorée parce que c'est pour votre plaisir ; il vous est donné. La nourriture vous a été donnée; Je sais que vous ne le mangerez pas par le nez car c'est dangereux mais avec la bouche. Voulez-vous vous lever et manger cette nourriture ? Mangez, il n'y a rien de mal à cela. Ou voulez-vous sauter en mangeant ? La méthode de consommation de cette nourriture n'est pas décrite. Voulez-vous mélanger la nourriture et la soupe et manger ? Cela vous fait-il plaisir ? Il n'y a pas de péché à faire cela. Quelle que soit la manière dont la nourriture passe de votre bouche à votre estomac, ce qui vous donne satisfaction et joie de sorte que vous vous tournez et dites que je vous bénis, Seigneur Divin de m'avoir donné de la nourriture ; le Seigneur vous donne la liberté.  **\n\nNotez que ce que les gens du monde appellent le sexe oral n'est pas reconnu par la Bible. C'est une pratique impure.  **\n Romains. 1 verset 26 à 30   **\n\n« C'est pourquoi Dieu les a livrés à de viles affections ; car même leurs femmes ont changé l'usage naturel en ce qui est contre nature ;\nEt de même aussi les hommes, quittant l'usage naturel de la femme, s'enflammèrent dans leur convoitise les uns envers les autres ; des hommes avec des hommes travaillant ce qui est inconvenant, et recevant en eux-mêmes la récompense de leur erreur qui était digne.\nEt même comme ils n'aimaient pas retenir Dieu dans leur connaissance, Dieu les a livrés à un esprit réprouvé, pour faire les choses qui ne sont pas commodes ;\nÊtre rempli de toute injustice, fornication, méchanceté, convoitise, méchanceté; plein d'envie, de meurtre, de débat, de tromperie, de malignité ; chuchoteurs,\n26\tMédisants, haïsseurs de Dieu, méchants, orgueilleux, vantards, inventeurs de mauvaises choses, insoumis aux parents ,\"   **\n\nRomains. 1 verset 26 \"C'est pourquoi Dieu les a livrés à des affections viles  car même leurs femmes ont changé l'usage naturel en ce qui est contre nature.\" Il y a ce qui est naturel, il y a ce qui est contre nature. Il poursuit en disant au verset 24   « C'est pourquoi Dieu les a aussi livrés à l'impureté par les convoitises de leur propre cœur, pour déshonorer entre eux leur propre corps . « Sucer la partie intime de votre conjoint est une malpropreté. Cela ne fait pas partie du sexe, ce sont les gens du monde qui l'appellent le sexe oral. La Bible prévoit-elle cela ? Je vais donner la raison. La luxure est ce qui cause cela. Voir le verset 27 . « Et de même aussi les hommes, laissant l'usage naturel de la femme », Pouvez-vous comprendre maintenant ? Naturel! Les hommes laissent l'usage naturel des femmes. Le verset 28 dit   « Et même s'ils n'aimaient pas retenir Dieu dans leur connaissance, Dieu les a livrés à un esprit réprouvé ». Ces choses sont sorties d'esprits corrompus. Encore une fois la Bible nous dit dans 29 à 30, « étant rempli de toute iniquité. Médisants, haïsseurs de Dieu, méchants, orgueilleux, vantards, inventeurs de mauvaises choses ». C'est une mauvaise invention. Vous appelez ça du sexe oral mais c'est une invention diabolique. Ce n'est pas du sexe. Le sexe ne se fait que par les organes génitaux/sexuels. Les gens du monde, parce que Dieu les a abandonnés pour faire ce qu'ils veulent faire, inventent beaucoup de choses dans ce domaine de la sexualité. S'il vous plaît, n'allez pas sur eux, allez sur ce qui est naturel. N'allez pas regarder des films bleus, parce que vous voulez faire l'amour avec votre femme et donc vous vous asseyez tous les deux et regardez des films bleus. Satan devrait-il vous sermonner avant de continuer à accomplir ce que Dieu vous a gracieusement donné ? Satan devrait-il vous sermonner ? \"Je ne mettrai rien de méchant (mauvais) devant mes yeux...\" (Psaume 101 verset 3) Vous permettez que l'abomination se fasse à vos yeux. \"Détourne mes yeux de la vanité...\" (Psaume 119 verset 37). Vous permettez à la vanité d'être devant vous et dites qu'elle vous aide ? Savez-vous à quel point cette chose est sponsorisée par le diable ? Savez-vous que partout où il est joué, les démons sont là et Dieu cède ? Dieu doit céder parce que vous êtes entré dans le territoire de Satan ; Dieu n'est pas là et ces démons vous posséderont. Votre esprit sera obsédé. Vous êtes très ému pour votre femme mais pour combien de temps ? Même si vous continuez à le regarder, un moment viendra où il ne vous touchera plus. La corruption! Vous êtes chrétien, pourquoi suivez-vous le monde et pourquoi faites-vous ce qui est du monde ? Pourquoi utiliser les méthodes du monde ? Non! Ne regardez pas de pornographie. Ne regardez pas des personnes nues sur une photo avec l'intention de déplacer votre corps. Si votre corps a du mal à bouger, demandez à Dieu de vous aider.  **\nEncore une fois, pourquoi disons-nous que le sexe oral n'est pas scripturaire ? C'est parce que l'une des principales raisons des relations sexuelles ou des rapports sexuels ou de l'amour est la procréation.  **\nGenèse 4 verset 1 à 2   **\n« Et Adam connut Eve sa femme ; et elle conçut, et enfanta Caïn, et dit  J'ai pris un homme de la part du Seigneur.\nEt elle enfanta de nouveau son frère Abel. Et Abel était berger, mais Caïn labourait la terre.   \nEt Adam connut Eve sa femme\" Adam a eu des relations sexuelles avec Eve ou Adam a eu des relations sexuelles avec Eve. Ce n'était pas du sexe oral. Le résultat du sexe avec elle est qu'un enfant s'est formé. Ensuite, il y a la manière naturelle de le faire. Il y a une partie sexuelle conçue par Dieu chez un homme et chez une femme. Le sexe est le frottement et le jeu entre les parties sexuelles. Votre bouche n'est jamais une partie sexuelle, sauf pour les baisers, ce qui est ok. S'embrasser n'est pas seulement pour le sexe, c'est une communication d'amour \" Saluez-vous les uns les autres avec un saint baiser. \" (1 Corinthiens 16 verset 20, 2 Corinthiens 13 verset 12). Embrasser est une communication d'amour et puisque faire l'amour est une atmosphère d'amour, cela peut se faire. Mais le sexe oral n'est pas scripturaire car il ne produit pas d'enfants. Ce qui produit des enfants est ce qui est naturel, une interaction entre les parties sexuelles d'une femme et d'un homme. C'est une abomination de lécher le sexe ou d'utiliser l'anus de la femme comme le font les homosexuels. C'est une abomination car l'anus de la femme, en fait l'anus en général, n'est pas une partie sexuelle. Ce sont ces inventeurs de choses mauvaises que Dieu a abandonnés à eux-mêmes qui les pratiquent. Peut-être utiliseront-ils éventuellement les yeux, l'oreille ou forceront-ils le nez à se dilater pour leur perversion/impureté sexuelle ! Ce sont des gens livrés à brûler dans leur luxure et prêts pour l'enfer. Restez à l'écart de ces choses.  **\n \nComprendre la Sexualité   **\nCependant, une connaissance claire et saine de la sexualité est importante. Il n'est pas bon que l'homme soit sans connaissance. Certains d'entre nous restent encore traditionnels sans s'améliorer ; la science découvre beaucoup de bonnes choses pour nous, même dans ce domaine, la science a découvert beaucoup de bonnes choses. Une connaissance pure, bonne et saine est apparue et la Bible dit dans 2 Pierre 1 verset 5, \"Et à côté de cela, donnant toute diligence ….. \", marquez le mot \" toute diligence \" c'est-à-dire utilisez la force, soyez fervent à ce sujet, \" ajoutez à votre foi la vertu ; et à la connaissance de la vertu ». Es-tu un homme de Dieu ? Connaître la sexualité aussi. Ajoutez à cet homme de Dieu; à ce que vous avez connu de Jésus, ajoutez la connaissance de la sexualité. Les découvertes propres, bonnes et pures sur l'amour sont utiles. Vous voulez donner le meilleur à votre femme ; vous voulez donner à votre mari le meilleur dans ce domaine dans la vie de votre vanité sur terre ? Ajoutez à vous des connaissances. Apprenez de bonnes et saines méthodes et manières de satisfaire votre conjoint. Procurez-vous de bons livres sur le sexe conjugal et lisez-les pour améliorer votre sexualité et surmonter les problèmes sexuels conjugaux. D'autres ont traversé les problèmes que vous traversez, mais ils ont surmonté et les réponses sont écrites pour vous dans des livres. Ajoutez à votre connaissance de la foi afin que vous puissiez avoir la victoire sur ce type de problème. Obtenez plus de connaissances afin que vous puissiez avoir une sexualité fructueuse et des performances satisfaisantes. Apprenez-le, étudiez et enrichissez-vous. Faut-il savoir comment faire pour faire des enfants ? Allez lire des livres, faites des recherches, il y a des réponses pour vous. Dieu dit cela parce que tout est à vous, pour votre bénéfice, votre amélioration et votre amélioration. Oui. Cherchez conseil pour votre bonheur et celui de votre conjoint. Demandez conseil sur la façon dont vous pouvez le faire mieux et surmonter, afin que vous et votre conjoint soyez heureux.  **\n1 Corinthiens 7 verset 1 à 5   **\n«Maintenant, en ce qui concerne les choses dont vous m'avez écrit, il est bon qu'un homme ne touche pas une femme.\nNéanmoins, pour éviter la fornication, que chaque homme ait sa propre femme, et que chaque femme ait son propre mari.\nQue le mari rende à la femme la bienveillance qui lui est due ; et de même aussi la femme au mari.\nLa femme n'a pas le pouvoir de son propre corps, mais le mari ; et de même aussi le mari n'a pas le pouvoir de son propre corps, mais la femme.\nNe vous trompez pas les uns les autres, si ce n'est avec un consentement pour un temps, afin que vous puissiez vous adonner au jeûne et à la prière ; et rassemblez-vous de nouveau, afin que Satan ne vous tente pas pour votre incontinence ».  **\nMaintenant, notez ce qui suit dans la sexualité et veillez à les observer      **\n1   La Bible dit ne prive pas ton mari de ton corps, c'est un péché ; ne prive pas ta femme de ton corps. S'il s'agit d'une maladie ou d'un empêchement ou d'une déficience, qu'il y ait une explication. Expliquez-le soigneusement afin qu'il ne semble pas être de la méchanceté, afin qu'il puisse devenir un sujet commun de prières. ' Oh je suis fatigué' donner une explication minutieuse. « Oh, je ne peux pas dire pourquoi mon corps ne bouge pas », dites-le tel qu'il est. « Quelque chose ne va pas chez moi quelque part », oui, Satan semble également interférer dans ce domaine. Donc, il n'y a rien de mal à découvrir quelque part le travail de la main de Satan sur vous, mais faites-le ressortir clairement. Mais si vous êtes en bonne santé et que vous refusez le sexe à votre conjoint parce que vous êtes ce type autoritaire en colère, alors préparez-vous à l'enfer. Il y a une femme qui avait l'habitude de priver son mari de son corps sur le lit. Habituellement, elle utilisait tous les oreillers pour diviser le lit en deux   un côté pour elle et l'autre pour son mari et elle dira à son mari de ne pas traverser vers elle. Son mari était pasteur. Jésus a rendu visite à cette femme par révélation et lui a dit  «Si c'est le dernier jour de ta vie, je t'aurais jetée en enfer, car mon serviteur, ton mari me sert et je suis heureux avec lui et je veux qu'il soit paisible, joyeux et je veux qu'il fasse mon travail avec bonheur, qu'il t'apprécie et qu'il me remercie, mais tu le frustres. Beaucoup de choses que cet homme aurait faites pour moi, tu l'as empêché. Sais-tu femme, qu'il y a des moments où ton mari reste trop longtemps au lit, c'est parce qu'il prie peut-être que tu pourrais lui ouvrir ? Le travail qu'il serait allé faire pour lequel tu l'as fait rouler sur le lit, tu l'expliqueras à Dieu. Il aurait eu du plaisir avant d'aller au service divin ou peut-être qu'il voyageait même et il sentait qu'il devrait avoir du plaisir mais il ne pouvait pas le faire et il a voyagé en colère, vous le paierez. Ne sais-tu pas que tu as été racheté à grand prix ? Vous avez été acheté deux fois tandis que l'homme a été acheté une fois. Comment avez-vous été acheté deux fois? L'homme vous a acheté et Jésus vous a acheté - c'est deux. L'homme n'a été acheté que par Jésus, alors quelle fierté exercez-vous maintenant ? Alors servez vos maîtres, l'homme et Jésus-Christ, et recevez aussi la double bénédiction. Vous avez la chance de recevoir le double, de l'homme et de Jésus. Alors soyez fidèle et s'il y a un problème expliquez bien. Cherchez une explication douce et pas comme quand une mère chienne veut que ses petits arrêtent de téter le lait maternel, elle les refuse avec colère. C'est comme ça que vous agissez dans cette maison ? Soyez douce, aimante et pacifique et demandez à Dieu d'aider votre mari à comprendre en cas de difficulté.  **\n\nI  Il devrait y avoir un accord mutuel si, pour une raison quelconque, vous pouvez rester à l'écart. Sinon, il devrait y avoir une régularité dans les relations sexuelles ou les ébats amoureux, à l'exception de toute déficience, alors cela devrait être expliqué. Le Seigneur dit   « Ne vous trompez pas les uns les autres, sauf avec le consentement que vous pouvez jeûner, mais après cela, réunissez-vous » . C'est une chose que l'on s'attend à ce que vous fassiez régulièrement. Dieu qui l'a fait dit de le rendre régulier car cela aidera vos vies, cela gardera vos cœurs purifiés. Toute offense meurt lorsqu'il y a un véritable rapport sexuel. Les offenses de l'esprit disparaissent ; rendez-le régulier.   **\nII   Il devrait y avoir une protection mutuelle contre le péché et Satan. Vous êtes libre et ne vous embêtez pas, mais qu'en est-il de votre partenaire ? Savez-vous ce que le diable fait avec elle ? Connaissez-vous les pensées que Satan amène sur cet homme alors qu'il marche dans la rue ? Vous êtes là pour le protéger de Satan, afin que ces pensées puissent s'éloigner de ses émotions et qu'il revienne à lui-même. Lorsque vous avez mangé de la bonne nourriture à votre satisfaction, tout autre aliment que vous voyez ne vous intéresse pas. C'est à l'affamé que toute chose amère est douce. Si vous pouvez vous satisfaire les uns les autres, vous mépriserez tous ceux que vous croiserez dans la rue. Même ces filles qui ouvrent leur corps dans la rue, votre mari les méprisera. Elles sont peut-être plus belles que vous, il ne s'agit plus de beauté cette fois, il s'agit maintenant de satisfaire le corps - il les méprisera. Et toi l'homme aussi, fais plaisir à ta femme, si tu le fais, elle ne dérangera ni ne dérangera les autres hommes. Ce sera clair quand c'est Satan qui vient maintenant en tentation parce que vos mains sont pures.  **\n\nIII   Il doit y avoir conjoint agréable en fourniture. Il y a quelque temps, un homme est venu me voir pour des conseils et m'a dit que sa femme ne lui permettait pas de participer au deuxième tour. Femme, si vous êtes du genre dont le mari demande un deuxième tour, essayez de le lui fournir. Je sais que vous avez appris à être patient, alors essayez au moins de temps en temps, sinon l'homme ne sera pas satisfait et pleurera, alors essayez de plaire à votre conjoint. Faites un effort supplémentaire pour plaire à votre conjoint dans cette affaire. Ou cela pourrait être l'inverse, que l'homme essaie également de fournir.  **\n\nIV   Qu'il y ait de la maîtrise de soi. Homme, qu'il y ait de la maîtrise de soi sinon une bonne chose se transformera en une mauvaise. Si vous poussez quelqu'un contre le mur, il réagira. En d'autres termes, lorsque vous le poussez à l'excès, votre partenaire peut réagir. Si vous poussez la femme contre le mur, elle réagira. S'il vous plaît, sachez cela et priez Dieu de vous aider, de vous donner la maîtrise de vous-même, et Il vous aidera. Vous savez, si votre montre fonctionne trop vite, il existe un moyen de réduire la vitesse. De la même manière, apportez-vous à Dieu dans la prière pour réduire votre vitesse ; demande à Dieu de réduire ta vitesse car tu es trop rapide pour ta femme. Votre femme ne marche peut-être pas aussi vite que vous, souvenez-vous toujours d'elle et attendez-la. Alors contrôlez-vous, entraînez-vous et disciplinez-vous. Vous ne jeûnez pas ? Mangez-vous de la nourriture tous les jours ? Alors comment serez-vous un chrétien fort? Nous jeûnons ! Certains jeûnent pendant des jours. Ne pouvez-vous pas vous abstenir pendant un certain temps et vous reposer, afin que lorsque vous vous réunirez, tout soit frais et beau ? Il devrait y avoir de la maîtrise de soi.  ** \nV   Il faut être patient dans une situation défavorable car nous sommes dans cette vie de défi. Il pourrait y avoir une maladie ou l'autre partenaire pourrait avoir un problème. Qu'en est-il du jeûne qui peut devenir nécessaire ? Alors soyez patients, supportez-vous les uns les autres. Le nombre de fois que vous vous rencontrez pour faire l'amour avant de mourir n'est pas nécessaire pour que vous alliez au paradis. Ce n'est pas l'une des qualifications pour le ciel. Vous n'aurez pas besoin de montrer le nombre de fois que vous vous rencontrez avant de mourir à Dieu au ciel. Veuillez le supporter, il est de la chair et la chair passera. Contrôlez-vous quand c'est nécessaire et faites preuve de patience.  **\nVI   Il devrait y avoir une compréhension mutuelle. La compréhension vous permettra donc de vous comprendre.\nVII   Priez pour la présence divine et la bénédiction. Présence divine pour rendre l'occasion douce et raffinée. Bénédiction divine pour lui faire atteindre son objectif qui peut être de procréer ou tout autre objectif que vous avez en tête. Prier Dieu. Au cas où il y aurait une interférence de Satan, par la prière vous la surmonterez. Priez pour votre femme en privé ; priez pour votre mari en privé et priez ensemble aussi car Dieu vous entendra et perfectionnera les choses.  **\nVIII  Il devrait y avoir une intimité dans les relations amoureuses entre mari et femme. Ceci est très important pour ne pas permettre aux enfants et aux autres personnes qui se trouvent autour d'être émotionnellement agités et pollués. Le sexe ouvert est généralement un problème de pauvreté, je prie pour que le Seigneur vous aide. Imaginez, vous et vos enfants adultes dormez dans une pièce et vous faites l'amour dans la même pièce où ils se trouvent. Comprenez-vous ce que vous faites ? Vous touchez ces enfants pendant toute leur vie; toute leur vie. À quel point êtes-vous pauvre pour ne pas pouvoir racheter la situation ? On m'a parlé de certains enfants dont les parents les ont empêchés de regarder de la pornographie mais qui dorment dans la même pièce que leurs parents. Ils n'ont utilisé qu'un rideau pour séparer / diviser la pièce, c'est-à-dire entre eux et leurs enfants. Pendant leurs ébats amoureux, les enfants ne dormiront pas ; ils sont éveillés et très intéressés par ce qui se passe entre leurs parents. Comme on me l'a dit, les enfants sont allés accrocher un miroir au plafond pour qu'ils regardent la performance/l'amour de leurs parents. Ces enfants sont intelligents et avant que vous ne le sachiez , ils commencent à faire l'amour les uns avec les autres. Vous leur avez appris à le faire, vous les avez exposés. Êtes-vous trop pauvre pour ne pas pouvoir louer une autre maison ? Criez au Dieu de justice, il vous répondra.  **\nIX   Pour ceux qui ont un partenaire incroyant, la foi, la prière, l'endurance et la sagesse sont requises et la grâce de Dieu vous suffira. Si vous acceptez la peur que votre mari ait apporté le VIH, ou si vous entendez qu'il s'en prend à une femme, vous ruinerez cette maison. Si vous refusez votre corps à votre conjoint à cause de cela, cela affectera votre éternité. Il vaut mieux être malade et aller au ciel que d'être fort et aller en enfer. Qui t'a dit que tu serais malade ? Présentez votre cas à Dieu et dites   « Dieu, c'est à cause de ta parole que je fais cela, et tu connais le danger, mais c'est à cause de ta parole que je fais cela, aide-moi, ô Dieu ! Le Seigneur vous aidera, la maladie ne vous traversera pas, alors soyez en paix. Et l'ivrogne avec toute l'odeur, qu'allez-vous faire ? \"Tout ce que tu m'as appris à dire, mon Seigneur , c'est bien, c'est bien avec mon âme.\" C'est bien avec votre âme. Maintenez la droiture de votre âme, bien que votre nez respire différemment, le Seigneur vous aidera. Que le Seigneur entende votre cri pour le salut de cet homme, mais soyez toujours fidèle. Demandez conseil là où c'est nécessaire.  **\n \nChapitre Trois Procréer   **\nLa procréation est l'un des buts du mariage. C'est la volonté de Dieu que vous conceviez et donniez naissance à des enfants. La Bible nous a fait comprendre que Dieu a créé tout être vivant sur la terre pour qu'il ait sa semence, selon son espèce (Genèse 1 versets 21 à 25).\nGenèse 1 verset 28   **\n« Et Dieu les bénit, et Dieu leur dit   Soyez féconds, multipliez, et remplissez la terre, et soumettez-la, et dominez sur les poissons de la mer, et sur les oiseaux du ciel, et sur tout être vivant. qui se meut sur la terre.\nDieu veut que vous soyez féconds, Dieu veut que vous vous multipliiez et Il veut que vous donniez naissance à des enfants. Voir ,   **\n Premier Timothée 5 verset 14.\n\"Je veux donc que les jeunes femmes se marient, aient des enfants, dirigent la maison, ne donnent aucune occasion à l'adversaire de parler avec reproche.\"  **\n\"Les jeunes femmes se marient, ont des enfants\" . Femme, c'est la volonté de Dieu pour toi, que tu aies des enfants. C'est ce que Dieu veut. Les jeunes femmes se marient, ont des enfants ! Les enfants sont les bénédictions du Seigneur, heureux est l'homme qui en a plein son carquois. C'est en fait vrai à certains égards, très vrai; certains sont vraiment heureux alors que pour d'autres c'est de la peine. Ils souhaitent qu'ils n'avaient pas donné naissance à un. Mais, les enfants, sont en effet une bénédiction et Dieu veut que vous les ayez. Il veut aussi que vous soyez heureux, cela, vous devez le savoir par les Écritures.\nDieu est celui qui donne des enfants. Le Seigneur vous a créé, vous a créé et vous a conçu pour porter et délivrer des enfants. C'est Sa volonté et Son désir; Il a donné l'ordre, \"Soyez fructueux\". L'Écriture en témoigne .  **\nPsaumes 127 versets 3 à 5   **\n« Voici, les enfants sont un héritage de l'Éternel, et le fruit du sein est sa récompense.\nComme les flèches sont dans la main d'un homme puissant ; ainsi sont les enfants de la jeunesse.\nHeureux l'homme qui en a plein son carquois , ils n'auront pas honte, mais ils parleront avec les ennemis à la porte.  **\nPsaumes 128 verset 3   **\nTa femme sera comme une vigne féconde à côté de ta maison; tes enfants comme des oliviers autour de ta table.  **\n \nGenèse 33 verset 5   **\n« Et il leva les yeux, et vit les femmes et les enfants ; et dit  Qui sont ceux qui sont avec toi? Et il dit   Les enfants que Dieu a gracieusement donnés à ton serviteur.  **\n\nGenèse 4 verset 1, 25   **\n« Et Adam connut Eve sa femme ; et elle devint enceinte, et enfanta Caïn, et dit   J'ai pris un homme de la part de l'Éternel.\n2 « Et Adam connut de nouveau sa femme ; et elle enfanta un fils, et appela son nom Seth   car Dieu, dit-elle, m'a établi une autre semence à la place d'Abel, que Caïn a tué.  **\n\nGenèse 17 verset 16   **\n« Et je la bénirai, et je te donnerai aussi un fils d'elle, oui, je la bénirai, et elle sera une mère des nations ; les rois des peuples seront d'elle.  **\nGenèse 21 verset 1 à 2   **\n« Et l'Éternel visita Sara comme il l'avait dit, et l'Éternel fit à Sara comme il l'avait dit.\nCar Sara conçut et enfanta un fils à Abraham dans sa vieillesse, au temps fixé dont Dieu lui avait parlé.  **\n \nPremières Chroniques 25 verset 5b   **\n\"Et Dieu donna à Héman quatorze fils et trois filles.\"\nPremières Chroniques 26 versets 4 à 5 (paraphrasés)\n\" Obed-Edom eut huit fils \" car Dieu le bénit \".  **\n\nPsaumes 139 verset 13 à 14    **\n« Car tu as possédé mes reins   tu m'as couvert dans le sein de ma mère.\nje te louerai; car je suis terriblement et merveilleusement fait\nmerveilleuses sont tes oeuvres; et que mon âme le sait bien.\nD'après les versets ci-dessus, vous pouvez voir que la procréation est le but et la volonté de Dieu pour ses enfants et que Dieu est le donneur d'enfants.    **\n \nRetard dans la procréation      **\nLa maternité peut être retardée ou bloquée. Certaines femmes conçoivent et portent des enfants rapidement , par exemple Leah, cependant, il existe des cas où la procréation est retardée ou bloquée, par exemple, Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Hannah et Elizabeth. Le diable a détruit tant de maisons à cause de ce retard. Les femmes sont les plus touchées par cela. Beaucoup de femmes sont dans la douleur et l'angoisse à cause du retard dans la procréation, à cause des moqueries (comme Hannah), de la stigmatisation et de l'étiquette maléfique de leurs voisins, de leurs beaux-parents, en particulier des belles-mères et certaines même des menaces de leurs maris de épouser une autre femme ou divorcer. Cela a poussé ces femmes à chercher de l'aide là où elles ne sont pas censées le faire; ils mettent la main au mal et entrent dans les pièges du diable dans le but d'avoir un enfant. On a raconté l'histoire d'une femme à qui l'on avait donné de la bouse de vache mélangée à quelque concoction à boire dans la partie sud du Nigéria, le tout dans le but d'obtenir le fruit de l'utérus. Voyez ce que vous vous faites.\nMais comment êtes-vous, un enfant de Dieu, censé répondre à cette situation ? Que faites-vous si vous avez un retard dans la procréation et que les gens se moquent de vous et vous traitent de stérile ? Peut-être que vos voisins vous empêchent même de communiquer avec leurs enfants ou de les envoyer faire une course, par exemple Rachel.  **\n \nLa réponse d'un chrétien au retard dans la procréation     **\n1   Placer Dieu en premier   Un chrétien doit placer Dieu au-dessus de son conjoint, de ses enfants et de la richesse de sa famille. Dieu doit être au-dessus de votre mari, au-dessus de votre femme, au-dessus des enfants, au-dessus de la richesse.  **\nPsaumes 73 verset 25   **\n« En qui ai-je ciel mais toi? et il n'y a personne sur la terre que je désire en dehors de toi.  **\nAssurez-vous que le désir de votre mari n'est pas au-dessus de Dieu. Femme, assure-toi que ton désir d'enfants n'est pas au-dessus de Dieu. Familles chrétiennes, assurez-vous que votre désir d'argent ou d'avoir des enfants dans votre mariage ne dépasse pas celui de Dieu. Qui encore as-tu au ciel ? As-tu un mari qui t'emmènera au paradis ? Non! C'est Dieu. Qui encore est de la plus grande aide pour votre vie éternelle sur terre ? C'est Dieu. Cela devrait donc être dans votre cœur. Que votre joie soit pleine dans le Seigneur. Sachez cela et placez Dieu en premier. Laissez-le être votre tout. \n2   Être satisfait   Le croyant doit donc apprendre le contentement dans cette vie dans n'importe quel état que Dieu le place ou lui permet d'être.\nApprenez le contentement dans cette vie.  **\nPremier Timothée 6 verset 6 à 7   **\n« Mais la piété avec contentement est un grand gain.\nCar nous n'avons rien apporté dans ce monde, ( pas même des enfants ) et il est certain que nous ne pouvons rien emporter.  **\nSoyez donc très prudent, apprenez le contentement. \"Nous n'avons rien apporté dans ce monde et il est (très) certain que nous ne pouvons rien emporter\", donc c'est de la vanité. La Bible dit   « … toutes les années de ta vanité… ». (Ecclésiaste 9 verset 9 ), dans ces années de vanité vous avez des enfants que vous n'êtes pas sûr de réaliser, ne laissez pas la vanité affecter la réalité ; le ciel est une réalité. Combien de ces enfants naîtront de nouveau et iront au paradis ? Combien d'entre eux seront pasteurs ? Alors pourquoi courir après au point d'affecter la réalité, d'affecter votre âme. Ne vous fâchez pas tellement en cherchant des enfants que vous vous mettiez en colère contre Dieu au point d'affecter votre piété. Une histoire a également été racontée à propos d'une autre femme de la ceinture médiane du Nigéria, qui était en colère contre Dieu parce qu'elle était mariée depuis environ quatre ans sans problème. Elle cessa de prier Dieu et décida, par impatience, de s'occuper elle-même du problème. C'est probablement elle qui a convaincu son mari qu'ils devaient opter pour la fécondation in vitro et ils l'ont fait. Après avoir dépensé plus d'un million de nairas pour tomber enceinte de cette manière, le bébé a été débusqué, c'est-à-dire avorté. \"Qui est celui qui dit, et cela arrive, alors que le Seigneur ne le commande pas.\" (Lam. 3 verset 37). Dieu lui a fait comprendre qu'elle n'est que chair et qu'elle ne peut pas l'aider et qu'il est le donneur d'enfants; s'Il ne le permet pas, cela ne tiendra pas. Ils ont appris leur leçon et plus tard ont adopté un garçon dont ils ont pris grand soin, puis Dieu, dans sa miséricorde, les a bénis avec leur propre bébé (une petite fille). Bien sûr, leur garçon adoptif est leur premier enfant, et si on ne vous le dit pas, vous ne saurez pas qu'il n'est pas leur enfant biologique. Dieu ne rejettera aucun homme ou femme qui n'a pas d'enfant et Il ne supprimera pas non plus le nom d'une telle personne du livre de vie ou ne lui refusera pas l'entrée au ciel. Pourquoi êtes-vous si en colère, dans la rue, si en colère contre votre mari, si en colère contre votre femme au point que votre piété en est affectée. \"La piété avec le contentement est un grand gain.\" Grand gain pas petit gain ; que vous traversez cette vie et que vous n'avez pas d'enfants, mais que vous êtes pieux et que vous avez du contentement, vous avez acquis la meilleure chose qu'un homme puisse gagner dans ce monde. Grand gain car il donne la vie éternelle. Haman s'est vanté de ses sept enfants et ils ont été pendus en un jour. Alors soyez très prudents, faisons attention à ce qui compte. Ne laissez rien de cette terre vous affecter. La Bible dit   « Et ayant de la nourriture et des vêtements, soyons satisfaits. (I Tim. 6 verset 8). Mange-tu, as-tu des vêtements? Dieu vous a donné ce qu'il peut donner à l'humanité ; de telle sorte que l'humanité puisse l'apprécier suffisamment et faire du paradis - nourriture et vêtements; être content. Paul nous dit dans Philippiens 4 verset 12   « Je sais à la fois comment m'abaisser et je sais comment abonder   partout et en toutes choses, il m'a été ordonné à la fois d'être rassasié et d'avoir faim, d'abonder et de souffrir dans le besoin . ” Ici, nous apprenons comment Paul s'est comporté dans chaque situation et était paisible et bien.  **\n1   Renouvelez votre esprit   Pour atteindre ce caractère, nous devons comprendre Romains 12 verset 2 et l'incorporer, qui dit   « Et ne vous conformez pas à ce monde   mais soyez transformés par le renouvellement de votre esprit, afin que vous puissiez prouver ce que est cette bonne, et acceptable, et parfaite, volonté de Dieu . Ne vous conformez pas au modèle de l'homme naturel ; à la façon dont l'homme naturel pense; la façon dont les gens de ce monde pensent, mais être transformé en pensant d'une manière nouvelle. Quelle que soit la position que Dieu vous place, souvenez-vous que la parole du Tout-Puissant dit   « Et nous sachez que toutes choses concourent au bien de ceux qui aiment Dieu, de ceux qui sont appelés selon son dessein . (Rom. 8 verset 28). S'ils ne travaillent pas pour votre bien, cela fonctionnera pour le bien des autres à travers vous ; alors, apprenez à avoir des pensées qui vous garderont en paix. Paul a dit, je suis instruit (dans n'importe quelle condition)...\" ; il n'était même pas marié du tout, mais cela ne le dérangeait pas, car il y avait certaines sortes de pensées auxquelles il pensait et elles le retenaient. Quand il était parmi des gens mariés, cela ne signifiait rien, ne pas avoir de femme ne signifiait rien pour lui. Pendant qu'il se déplaçait dans son ministère, d'autres allaient avec leurs femmes, et cela n'affectait pas Paul parce qu'il savait penser. Son esprit était renouvelé après la connaissance de Dieu. Renouvelez votre esprit femme; apprenez à penser comme Paul pensait, de sorte que rien de négatif ne vous affectera. Renouvelez votre esprit Oh Man, apprenez à penser des pensées scripturaires qui vous garderont libre.  **\nVous pouvez dire   « J'ai honte ». La honte de votre vie vient du fait que vous avez abandonné la Bible, car la Bible dit que quiconque croit au nom du Seigneur n'aura pas honte. (Romains 10 verset 11 paraphrasé). Vous avez honte de ne pas avoir d'enfant ? Vous avez quitté l'Écriture. Vos pensées ne sont pas conformes aux Écritures. Vous avez honte parce que tous vos enfants sont des filles, vous avez abandonné l'Écriture. La famille juste de Philippe l'Évangéliste est inscrite dans les Écritures et il a eu quatre filles. Vous ne pensez pas bien, c'est pourquoi vous dites que vous avez honte. Vous dites « ils me critiquent » ; vous n'avez pas compris comment gérer toutes ces critiques . Paul a dit   « Je suis instruit sur la façon de les gérer ». Si quelqu'un vient vous regarder de haut et même dire des mots stupides, n'avez-vous pas d'amortisseur ? Il y a des amortisseurs scripturaires. Quand un homme est venu et a maudit David, qu'a dit David ? Il a dit 'laissez-le tranquille, laissez-le maudire, Dieu connaît mon innocence. Qui sait si par sa malédiction et ma patience le Seigneur me récompensera en me faisant délivrer de ma situation ? ( deuxième Samuel 16 verset 5 à 13). Ce sont des pensées qui sont des amortisseurs ; absorber les chocs et c'est ce dont vous avez besoin. “….dans toutes les choses que j'ai apprises”. Paul a dit, je l'ai appris, vous aussi allez l'apprendre dès aujourd'hui, allez le pratiquer, allez le découvrir.  **\nQuelqu'un se glorifie-t-il parce qu'il a de grands enfants ? Haman s'est glorifié et tous ses enfants ont été pendus un jour après sa mort. Quel est votre problème? Quel est votre problème ? Dieu vous a-t-il rejeté ? Dieu vous a-t-il refusé le ministère ? Dieu vous a-t-il refusé l'onction ? Dieu a-t-il nié que votre nom soit écrit dans le livre de vie ? Alors que cherchez-vous ? Vous êtes parti à votre manière.   **\n« ….. Donne-moi des enfants, sinon je meurs » (Genèse 30 verset 1), Rachel eut les enfants et mourut ; à quoi lui étaient-elles utiles ? Faire attention. Cela signifie que vous devez apprendre à maîtriser la peur, la honte, la timidité, le complexe d'infériorité, etc. ne pas déranger. Si vous pouvez changer vos pensées, vous serez libre ; personne ne te poursuit. Personne ne te dédaigne femme, la gloire du Seigneur est sur toi.  **\nPersonne ne te dédaigne homme, la gloire du Seigneur est sur toi. Le\nLa Bible, parlant de la génération de Jésus, dit   « ….Il n'y a rien à dire sur Sa génération… ». (Actes 8 verset 33 paraphrasé). C'est-à-dire qu'Il ne s'est pas marié ni n'a enfanté, pourtant Il est la personne avec la plus grande gloire sur la terre. La gloire vient du ciel. Cherchez la gloire qui vient du ciel et quand elle viendra du ciel sur vous, l'œil de chaque personne verra ce qui compte vraiment. La gloire du Seigneur est sur vous, la grâce du Seigneur est sur vous, le nom du Seigneur est sur vous et Dieu a ouvert une porte devant vous, pourquoi alors permettez-vous à Satan de vous troubler ? Rejetez-le, résistez-y.  **\nPaul a dit dans Actes 20 verset 24 \"Mais aucune de ces choses ne m'émeut, et je ne considère pas ma vie comme chère à moi-même, afin que je puisse terminer ma course avec joie, et le ministère que j'ai reçu du Seigneur Jésus, pour témoigner l'évangile de la grâce de Dieu. .” S'il vous plaît, ne laissez rien de cette terre, ce que vous avez et ce que vous n'avez pas, vous émouvoir. Vous avez un ministère, terminez ce ministère. Le ministère est l'évangile de Christ, prêchez-le. Paul a dit au\nGalates Chrétiens dans Galates 4 versets 13 à 15, il a dit   « Vous savez comment, par l'infirmité de la chair, je vous ai d'abord prêché l'évangile. 14. Et ma tentation qui était dans ma chair, vous ne l'avez pas méprisée, ni rejetée ; mais m'a reçu comme un ange de Dieu, comme le Christ Jésus. 15… car je vous rends témoignage que, si cela avait été possible, vous vous seriez arrachés les yeux et me les auriez donnés. Les personnes à qui vous prêchez ne se soucient pas de votre infirmité, elles voient plutôt le côté le plus brillant et c'est ce côté qui les attire. Ils ne se soucient pas de votre infirmité parce que vous avez quelque chose de précieux qui ne passe pas ; c'est la perle de grand prix que tout le monde veut obtenir. Par conséquent, changez votre état d'esprit et ne vous laissez pas émouvoir par les critiques, même par celles que Satan envoie sur votre chemin, par exemple Peninnah à Hannah dans Premier Samuel 1 verset 6 à 7, « Et son adversaire aussi l'irritait, pour la faire s'irriter, parce que l'Éternel avait fermé son ventre. Et comme il faisait ainsi d'année en année, lorsqu'elle montait à la maison de l'Éternel, elle l'irritait; c'est pourquoi elle pleura et ne mangea pas. Qu'aucune de ces choses ne vous émeuve comme l'apôtre Paul   « Mais aucune de ces choses ne m'émeut, et je ne considère pas ma vie comme chère à moi-même, afin que j'achève avec joie ma course et le ministère que j'ai reçu du Seigneur Jésus. , pour témoigner de l'évangile de la grâce de Dieu.  **\n1   Aller à Dieu dans les prières - Il répond aux prières   Là où la procréation est retardée ou bloquée, le couple doit prier et persévérer devant Dieu pour sa bénédiction à cet égard. Quelle que soit la raison pour laquelle la procréation est retardée ou bloquée, laissez le couple aller devant Dieu. Le mari ou la femme peut aller devant Dieu seul dans la prière et notre Dieu répond à la prière.  **\nGenèse 25 verset 20 à 21   **\n« Et Isaac avait quarante ans lorsqu'il prit pour femme Rebecca, la fille de Bethuel le Syrien de Padan-aram, la sœur de Laban le Syrien.\nEt Isaac supplia l'Éternel pour sa femme, parce qu'elle était stérile ; et l'Éternel le suppliait, et Rebecca, sa femme, devint enceinte.  **\nTu vois cela? Allez devant le Seigneur, passez du temps avec lui, parlez-lui et priez-le. Deux valent mieux qu'un, passez du temps tous les deux et priez. Vous pouvez rechercher la prière si le Seigneur vous le demande. Ne sautez pas de haut en bas, ne courez pas de haut en bas pour demander des prières et ne laissez pas de fausses mains sur vous, ruinant votre vie, parce que vous cherchez des enfants. Ce n'est que si le Seigneur vous l'ordonne, sinon vous et Dieu allez bien. Priez, le Seigneur vous répondra. La prière résoudra le problème.  **\nPremier Samuel 1 verset 2, 5, 9 à 20.  **\n« Et il avait deux femmes ; l'une s'appelait Anne, et l'autre Peninna; et Peninna avait des enfants, mais Anne n'avait pas d'enfants.\nMais à Hannah il a donné une portion digne; car il aimait Anne, mais l'Éternel avait fermé son ventre. \nEt son adversaire aussi l'irrita, pour la faire s'irriter, parce que l'Éternel avait fermé son ventre.\ndonc après qu'ils eurent mangé à Silo et qu'ils eurent bu. Le sacrificateur Éli était assis sur un siège près d'un poteau du temple de l'Éternel.\nEt elle était dans l'amertume de l'âme, et priait l'Éternel, et pleurait amèrement.\nEt elle fit un vœu, et dit   Ô Éternel des armées, si tu regardes vraiment l'affliction de ta servante, et que tu te souviennes de moi, et que tu n'oublies pas ta servante, mais que tu donnes à ta servante un enfant mâle, alors je donnerai vers l'Éternel tous les jours de sa vie, et il n'y aura pas de rasoir sur sa tête.\nEt il arriva, comme elle continuait à prier devant l'Éternel, qu'Eli marqua sa bouche.\nMaintenant Hannah, elle a parlé dans son cœur; seules ses lèvres remuaient, mais sa voix ne se faisait pas entendre   aussi Eli crut-elle qu'elle était ivre.\nEt Eli lui dit  Jusques à quand seras-tu ivre? ôte ton vin loin de toi.\nEt Anne répondit et dit  Non , mon seigneur, je suis une femme d'un esprit triste; je n'ai bu ni vin ni boisson forte, mais j'ai répandu mon âme devant l'Éternel.\nNe compte pas ta servante pour une fille de Bélial, car c'est de l'abondance de ma plainte et de ma douleur que j'ai parlé jusqu'ici.\nAlors Éli répondit et dit   Va en paix ; et le Dieu d'Israël t'accorde la requête que tu lui as demandée.\nEt elle dit   Que ta servante trouve grâce à tes yeux. Alors la femme s'en alla, et mangea, et son visage n'était plus triste.\nEt ils se levèrent de bonne heure le matin, et se prosternèrent devant l'Éternel, et s'en retournèrent, et vinrent dans leur maison à Rama et Elqana connut Anne sa femme; et l'Éternel se souvint d'elle.\nC'est pourquoi il arriva, quand vint le temps après qu'Anne eut conçu, qu'elle enfanta un fils, et appela son\nnomme Samuel, en disant   Parce que je l'ai demandé à l'Éternel.  **\n \nLes mêmes mots \"il savait' , utilisé pour Adam avec sa femme, a également été utilisé ici, c'est-à-dire qu'il a eu des relations sexuelles avec sa femme. La méthode ne nous est pas dite. Toutes les révélations qui vous parviennent, disant que Jésus a emmené quelqu'un en enfer, que si la femme est au-dessus de l'homme, pendant les rapports sexuels, c'est un péché. D'où ont-ils obtenu cela? L'Écriture ne nous le dit pas. Ce n'est pas dans l'Écriture. Le Dieu du ciel est un Dieu de variété et la variété est le plaisir de la vie. Il nous a donné divers aliments. Où est-ce que tu as trouvé ça? Je vous ai dit que la viande forte n'est pas pour ceux qui utilisent du lait. Vérifiez toutes ces personnes qui disent qu'elles sont allées au ciel, certains des témoignages sont une fabrication directe du diable, tandis que d'autres proviennent d'esprits immatures qui ne connaissent pas les Écritures. Et maintenant, certaines femmes disent que je ne peux plus être au-dessus de mon mari; ils citent même des écritures disant qu'Adam connaissait sa femme. Comprennent-ils ce qu'ils disent? Quelle méthode Adam a-t-il utilisée ? La méthode n'est pas spécifiée dans les Écritures. Toute méthode qui vous donne du plaisir et de la satisfaction, tant qu'elle n'est pas abusée ni mal utilisée, est acceptable par Dieu. Mettez ces rêves de côté afin qu'ils n'affectent pas les choses que Dieu vous a données dans la famille. Satan est à l'œuvre avec ces choses. Certains ont même dit que Jésus les a emmenés en enfer et que tous ceux qui utilisent la cravate iront en enfer. Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas avec les cravates ? On dit que ça ressemble à des serpents. Alors qu'en est-il des serpents, ne font-ils pas partie des animaux que Dieu a créés ? N'obtenez-vous pas certains avantages des serpents? Ils aident à avaler certains animaux comme les grenouilles, les rongeurs, etc. pour réduire leur nombre. Il n'y a rien dans ce monde qui ne soit au service de l'homme. Tout sert notre objectif; Dieu les a créés pour nous et a dit que nous devrions régner sur eux. Alors, s'il vous plaît, n'écoutez pas ces choses. Peut-être avez-vous déjà cessé de profiter pleinement de votre mari parce que quelqu'un qui ne connaît pas la Bible ou qui a encadré qu'il est allé en enfer l'a dit. Étiez-vous là? Tu l'as vu là-bas ? L'Écriture est la parole sûre de la prophétie. Jetez tout ce qui est contraire à l'Écriture. Elqana connaissait sa femme et elle a conçu par la prière. Présentez votre cas à Dieu dans la prière, il vous répondra.   **\nPremier Samuel 1 verset 25 à 27   **\n« Et ils tuèrent un taureau, et amenèrent l'enfant à Éli .\nEt elle dit  Oh mon seigneur, aussi ton âme est vivante, mon seigneur, je suis la femme qui se tenait ici près de toi, priant le SEIGNEUR.\nPour cet enfant j'ai prié; et l'Éternel m'a donné ma requête que je lui ai demandée.  **\n  \nPour Zachariah et Elizabeth, ils ont prié mais la réponse de Dieu à leur requête a mis du temps à venir. Abraham a prié, mais, avec toutes les promesses que Dieu lui a faites, ce n'est que jusqu'à ce que l'infécondité ait atteint vingt-cinq ans avant que l'enfant promis ne vienne, Dieu s'est tu. Dieu a ses relations avec vous frère, s'il vous plaît ne laissez pas Satan vous utiliser pour l'affecter. Ne laissez pas votre bouche le détruire ou vous bloquerez votre nom du livre de vie. Il y a des choses mystérieuses que vous ne pouvez pas expliquer.  **\nTaisez-vous, priez simplement avec lui et dites   « Que ta volonté, ô Dieu, soit faite ». Paul avait un ministère mystérieux ; les gens ont pleuré, ont tout fait pour l'en empêcher, il a dit, 'pourquoi essayez-vous de me briser le cœur? Si vous brisez ce cœur, vous le paierez et vous le paierez de votre vie. N'avez-vous pas entendu Dieu dire   Je lui montrerai combien il souffrira à cause de mon nom ? Ce qui m'attend à Jérusalem, n'est-ce pas une souffrance ? Dieu a dit que les liens et l'affliction m'attendent et le Seigneur dit que je suis pour cela; Je vais à Jérusalem'. (Actes 21 versets 11 à 14 paraphrasés). Paul avait un ministère spécial. Alors, n'utilisez pas votre langue pour essayer de dire des choses qui sont plus élevées que vous. Soyez très prudent. Pourquoi vas-tu te faire du mal ? Si vous avez de la compassion, que ce soit entre vous et Dieu ; ce n'est pas à toi de répandre les choses avec ta langue, de sorte que ceux qui ne connaissent pas la pensée de Dieu trébucheront à cause de toi.  **\n3   Demander l'avis/l'attention d'un médecin auprès de gynécologues et d'autres spécialistes de la fertilité   Parfois, un avis médical doit être demandé. L'homme et la femme doivent être impliqués conjointement dans les prières et recevoir des soins médicaux. Le retard dans la procréation peut provenir de la femme ou de l'homme ou des deux et le malade a besoin d'un médecin. Les médecins sont une bénédiction de Dieu. La science médicale est aussi belle que la science des télécommunications. C'est aussi beau que n'importe quelle autre science qui fait ressortir des choses qui améliorent la société, qui améliorent la vie humaine – utilisez-la ! Et ne vous abandonnez pas à la honte et à l'orgueil. Le malade a besoin d'un médecin.   **\nNotez, les choses très importantes suivantes     **\n1   Certains cas de stérilité sont sous le plein consentement et le contrôle de Dieu ; ils accomplissent Sa gloire. Quand le Seigneur a appris que son ami Lazare était malade, il a retardé. Pourquoi a-t-il tardé ? Il a dit   « ….Cette maladie n'est pas à la mort, mais pour la gloire de Dieu… » (Jean 11 verset 4). Ils sont tombés sur un homme aveugle, né aveugle et ses disciples ont demandé, qu'est-ce qui a fait que cet homme est né aveugle ? Est-ce à cause de son péché, ou de celui de ses parents ? Jésus a dit   « .... ni à lui ni à ses parents, mais que le Seigneur soit glorifié. (Jean 9 verset 3). Maintenant, considérez la stérilité d'Abraham avec toutes les promesses que Dieu lui a faites. Abraham a été appelé l'ami de Dieu, mais ce domaine a été laissé en jachère. Je vous dis, les oeuvres de Dieu sur un homme; elle diffère d'un homme à l'autre. Certains sont rapidement allés à l'école et ont obtenu leur diplôme tandis que d'autres ont souffert pour aller à l'école et obtenir leur diplôme, mais ils servent tous le but. Le Seigneur a dit   « Il y a un chemin droit que j'aurais voulu faire passer les enfants d'Israël depuis l'Égypte jusqu'à la terre promise, mais non, je vais les faire traverser le désert et j'ai des raisons pour cela ». (Exode 13 verset 17 à 18 paraphrasé). Le tien était hétéro mais celui de ton frère n'était pas hétéro Dieu a des raisons pour cela. A qui la faute, ton frère ? Non! Est-ce qu'il n'a pas la foi ? Non! Le Dieu de la foi fait quelque chose dans sa vie qui est plus que de procréer ou juste plus que cette chose (que vous recherchez peut-être dans sa vie). Il veut vous former, Il veut savoir ce qui est en vous, Il veut se manifester glorieusement dans votre vie future ; Dieu a un plan pour chaque homme. Voyez-le dans Isaac. Voyez-le aussi dans Zacharie et Elizabeth qui ont prié et prié. Jésus devait venir dans le monde et il avait besoin de guerriers de prière pour le prier et ainsi, Dieu a placé Zacharie dans une condition qui l'a maintenu ou l'a fait être dans une prière constante jusqu'à ce qu'il ait Jean-Baptiste, le précurseur de Jésus. Le Seigneur a voulu donner un prophète à Israël, Il a voulu un enfant de la foi et c'est ainsi qu'Anne, dont le Seigneur avait fermé le ventre, s'est édifiée. C'est la prière qui a produit un enfant de la promesse. Laissez Dieu seul. Soyez paisible en vous-même, rendez gloire à Dieu et rendez-Lui culte. Ne fais pas honte à ton frère. Ne fais pas honte à ton frère et ne mets pas en lui envie et jalousie. Ne fais pas ça. Ne le fais pas à ta sœur. Dieu fait quelque chose de spécial que Lui seul sait ; c'est une chose que vous devez savoir. Acceptez la volonté de Dieu pour votre vie. Notre devoir principal est de prier et de marcher dans la volonté de Dieu pour nos vies. Quelle que soit sa volonté; que vous ayez un enfant naturel, que vous soyez nourricier ou que vous n'ayez pas d'enfant, acceptez-le et engagez-vous à le faire avec plaisir. Dieu a un plan divin pour chacun de ses proches. Dieu est l'auteur de la vie. Il permet la conception et retient la conception. Dieu est souverain et possède toute sagesse et connaissance. « Car je connais les pensées que j'ai à votre égard, dit l'Éternel, des pensées de paix et non de mal, pour vous donner une fin attendue. Jérémie 29 verset 11 . \"Tout cadeau bon et parfait vient d'en haut. Jacques 1 verset 17 . Connaître et accepter ces vérités.  **\n1   Le nombre d'enfants qu'un couple devrait avoir ne semble pas être la préoccupation de Dieu mais Sa volonté dans la vie de ce couple. Le nombre d'enfants que vous devriez avoir n'est pas la principale préoccupation. Que font les enfants ? Cela devient encore plus terrible maintenant avec l'impiété chez les enfants. Le nombre d'enfants que vous devriez avoir n'est pas vraiment la préoccupation de Dieu. Certains prient \"Dieu me donne douze enfants\" et sont plus intéressés à élever un clan puisque beaucoup de membres de leur famille sont morts. Que se passerait-il après la création du clan ? Ce sera pour mener une guerre tribale chaque fois que quelqu'un viendra prendre votre terre; les enfants peuvent leur répondre (arrêter) à la porte, n'est-ce pas? La préoccupation de Dieu n'est pas le nombre d'enfants que vous devriez avoir, mais sa volonté dans votre vie. Que sa volonté soit faite dans votre vie. « Notre Père qui es aux cieux, que ton nom soit sanctifié. Que ton royaume vienne . Que ta volonté soit faite sur la terre comme au ciel ». (Matthieu 6 versets 9 à 10). Que la volonté du Seigneur soit faite dans votre vie. Voir le modèle biblique   Abraham a eu un enfant avec Sara et six enfants avec Ketura, mais aucun de ces six (avec Ketura) n'a d'importance dans le plan de Dieu. Ainsi, ce n'est pas le nombre d'enfants mais ce qui est le plan de Dieu qui importe. Donnez-moi un excès, et Dieu a dit  «Mais j'ai terminé mon plan, alors ne vous souciez pas de ces choses. Celui-ci, en Isaac ton nom sera appelé ». Quel est votre problème? Isaac lui-même, qui était un enfant de la promesse, en qui toutes les promesses de Dieu à Abraham s'accompliront dans sa vie, est resté sans enfant pendant vingt ans. Comme pour dire   'Dieu, que s'est-il passé ? N'est-ce pas vous qui avez donné à mon père toutes ces promesses ? Et Dieu a dit  \"Oui, j'ai mon temps, et je le ferai en mon temps.\" Donner naissance à des enfants, c'est beau. Je vous ai dit plus tôt, \" Heureux est l'homme qui en a plein son carquois\" mais cela ne signifie pas que le carquois de chaque homme doit en être rempli. Combien de fois Rebecca a-t-elle accouché ? Juste une fois; et avec cela elle a accompli la raison pour laquelle elle a été créée en tant que femme. La livraison unique de Rebecca était d'accord avec Dieu pour servir le dessein de Dieu à toutes les générations. Donc, vous devriez le voir de cette façon et bien faire les choses. Combien d'enfants avait Jephté, cet homme qui a opéré une grande délivrance pour Israël ? Il n'avait qu'un enfant et c'était une fille.\ndonc votre problème ?  **\n1   Le sexe d'un enfant n'a pas non plus d'importance. Certains d'entre vous s'inquiètent du sexe de leurs enfants au point de se dire   « Dieu mes enfants sont tous des filles, vous devez me donner des garçons. Il n'y a aucune différence aux yeux de Dieu que ce soit une femme ou un homme. Si la verge de Moïse a satisfait Dieu, combien plus un être humain ? Dieu peut utiliser qui Il veut, homme ou femme, peu importe. Il est à la fois le Dieu de l'homme et le Dieu de la femme. Alors, pourquoi êtes-vous troublé et dites-vous  'Je n'ai que des enfants de sexe féminin. ' Renouvelez votre esprit, comme le dit la Bible   « Soyez transformés par le renouvellement de votre esprit. Changez votre façon de penser. \"Ne vous conformez pas à ce monde\". (Romains 12 verset 2). Ces choses sont du monde. Vous pouvez prétendre que, 'Ce n'est que par un homme que votre nom sera appelé'. Est-ce quand vous serez déjà en enfer qu'ils appelleront votre nom ? En quoi cela vous sera-t-il bénéfique ? Ou quand tu es au paradis? En quoi cela vous sera-t-il bénéfique ? Nous parlons de l'éternité, vous êtes occupé à parler des choses de la terre. Suivons notre Dieu et laissons cette affaire aux gens du monde et retraçons le christianisme, le chemin de Dieu, le chemin de la paix, le chemin de la justice. \"Et vous connaîtrez la vérité, et la vérité vous affranchira. (Jean 8 verset 32). Même lorsque la fille de Jephté fut consacrée à\nDieu pour qu'elle ne se marie pas, Dieu n'a pas dit qu'il récompensera Jephté avec un autre enfant; l'homme n'a plus eu d'autre enfant. La chose la plus importante est qu'il ait été au paradis maintenant et non des enfants. Que le Seigneur le récompense avec le ciel. Le Seigneur sait si avoir un enfant ou des enfants vous affectera, Il sait si Satan passera par eux pour corrompre les choses confiées entre vos mains par Dieu. N'y a-t-il pas d'échelle de préférence ? Le Dieu tout sage ne comprendrait-il pas ? L'homme prudent ne prévoit-il pas le mal et ne se cache-t-il pas ? (Proverbes 22 verset 3 et chapitre 27 verset 12). Alors laissez l'affaire à Dieu, c'est au Dieu tout sage notre sauveur. Suivons-le donc et allons avec lui. Joseph avait deux enfants, pourquoi pas plus de deux ? Son père en avait jusqu'à douze mais pourquoi ses deux ? Était-ce une maladie, on ne sait pas ? Pas forcément la maladie. Nous aurions raison de dire que c'était plutôt la volonté de Dieu. Moïse a également eu deux enfants. Pas plus, que s'est-il passé ? Dieu l'a voulu ainsi. Avez-vous entendu parler des enfants de Moïse et de ce qu'ils ont fait ? Avez-vous entendu parler du rôle qu'ils ont joué en Israël ? Non! Ministres, travaillez dur sur vos enfants car ils sont l'intérêt de Satan. Les enfants de Samuel n'ont pas suivi ses voies mais étaient plutôt une justice malhonnête et pervertie (Premier Samuel 8 verset 3). Travaillez dur, travaillez dur pour vos enfants. Et si le Seigneur ne vous a pas donné beaucoup d'enfants, n'en cherchez pas davantage   \" A chaque jour suffit sa peine \". (Matthieu 6 verset 34)\nSoyez paisible, soyez très paisible. C'est ce que la parole de Dieu nous dit. Zachariah et Elizabeth, après une longue période de stérilité, n'ont donné naissance qu'à un enfant. Et ils n'ont pas pleuré pour un autre. Vous en avez déjà deux vous dites, 'pasteur priez pour moi, depuis dix ans que ma femme a mis au monde le dernier nous n'en avons pas eu d'autre'. Zachariah et Elizabeth en avaient un et étaient satisfaits. N'avez-vous pas de passion pour l'œuvre de Dieu ? Le jeûne que vous auriez dû faire pour la renaissance du monde, vous le faites pour plus d'enfants. Vous pouvez prétendre que les démons sont responsables du fait que vous n'ayez plus d'enfants ; prenez la partie scripturaire pour votre paix car Satan a trompé tant de gens dans ce domaine. Beaucoup de familles sont agitées, beaucoup de femmes sont agitées parce qu'il y a un manque de contentement. Tu as déjà un enfant tu dis encore 'non, non, non il faut que j'en ai un autre', tu n'as que des garçons et tu dis 'j'ai besoin d'une fille', ou tu n'as que des filles et tu dis 'j'ai besoin d'un garçon' , ou \"J'en ai besoin d'un autre\". C'est de l'agitation et Satan profitera de vous. Connaissez la vérité et laissez la vérité vous donner la paix, laissez la vérité vous donner la victoire, laissez la vérité vous donner le repos. Oui, c'est ce que nous voulons que vous sachiez et compreniez. Zacharie et Elizabeth ont donné naissance à un seul, Jean-Baptiste, et à aucun autre. Bien que Jacob ait eu une multitude d'enfants, pourquoi ? Cela a plu à Dieu. Voyez comment ils sont devenus les douze tribus d'Israël. Dans tout, il y a une main divine qui travaille. Vous pensez que Dieu est négligent ? Dieu n'est pas négligent; tout est bien conçu. C'est la main divine. L'apôtre Paul, et peut-être Barnabas aussi, et d'autres apôtres comme l'apôtre Jean ne se sont même pas mariés et ils ont apprécié leur condition qui leur a donné la meilleure opportunité de travailler pour Jésus. T'as pas entendu   **\nPaul a dit   « Celui qui n'est pas marié s'occupe des choses du\nSeigneur?\" \t( 1 Corinthiens 7 verset 32). Le Seigneur, qui connaissait l'apostolat qu'il avait donné à Paul, savait qu'une femme et des enfants pouvaient entraver cette œuvre. Dieu a dit   « Paul, tu peux te tenir debout, ma grâce te suffit ». Le Seigneur peut prendre une telle décision, rester avec Lui et être satisfait de Lui.  **\n \nCette exposition est essentielle pour aider certains d'entre nous qui ont un enfant ou deux ou pas du tout à apprendre le contentement dans cette vie et à voir ces jours bibliques se répéter dans nos vies. La plus grande chose que nous devrions désirer sur terre est de travailler avec ferveur pour Dieu sur terre et d'arriver au ciel. C'est la meilleure chose que nous devrions avoir dans cette vie. Ne laissez pas les enfants vous détourner de Dieu ou vous faire vous disputer à la maison, rancune ou envier les autres, il n'y a pas de honte pour vous en Christ. Vous pensez peut-être à ce que d'autres femmes diraient; il n'y a pas de honte pour ceux qui sont en Jésus-Christ. \"Car quiconque croit au nom du Seigneur n'aura pas honte.\" (Romains 10 verset 11 paraphrasé). De quelle honte parles-tu, la gloire est sur toi. La gloire du Seigneur est sur vous; il n'y a pas de honte.  **\nEsaïe 54 verset 1 à 4   **\n« Chante, ô stérile, toi qui n'as pas enfanté ; éclate en chants de joie, et crie à haute voix, toi qui n'as pas eu d'enfantement; car les enfants de la désolée sont plus nombreux que les enfants de la femme mariée, dit l'Éternel.\nAgrandis l'endroit de ta tente, et qu'ils étendent les rideaux de tes habitations, n'épargne pas, allonge tes cordes et renforce tes pieux;\nCar tu éclateras à droite et à gauche; et ta semence héritera les Gentils, et fera que les villes désolées seront habitées.\nNe craignez rien; car tu n'auras ni honte ni confusion; car tu n'auras pas honte, car tu oublieras la honte de ta jeunesse, et tu ne te souviendras plus de l'opprobre de ton veuvage.      **\n\nC'est Dieu. La percée spirituelle que vous allez avoir dans cette vie vous fera devenir un homme ou une femme glorieux. Il n'y aura pas de honte dans votre dossier; aucune honte dans votre famille. Il n'y aura pas de honte mais la gloire attachée à ton nom. Dieu dit, je donnerai à l'eunuque un nom meilleur que l'homme qui a des enfants. Esaïe56 verset 5 paraphrasé. C'est Dieu, suivez-le.  **\n          \t  \nChapitre quatre Adoption d' enfants   **\n \nQu'est-ce que l'adoption ?  **\nL'adoption signifie accepter ou revendiquer la propriété ou la parentalité d'un enfant qui n'est pas directement votre enfant biologique et faire profiter l'enfant du bénéfice de la parentalité tout au long de sa vie. Il est votre enfant et héritier comme n'importe lequel de vos enfants.  **\n \nQue dit la Bible sur l'adoption ?  **\nRomains 8 verset 15-17   **\n« Car vous n'avez plus reçu l'esprit de servitude à craindre ; mais vous avez reçu l'Esprit d'adoption, par lequel nous crions   Abba, Père.\nL'Esprit lui-même rend témoignage à notre esprit que nous sommes enfants de Dieu,\nEt si enfants, alors héritiers; héritiers de Dieu et cohéritiers de Christ; si du moins nous souffrons avec lui, afin que nous soyons aussi glorifiés ensemble.     **\nEphésiens 1 verset 5   **\n« Nous ayant prédestinés à l'adoption d'enfants par Jésus-Christ à lui-même, selon le bon plaisir de sa volonté »,  **\nL'adoption est bonne et acceptable aux yeux de Dieu. Nous n'étions pas enfants de Dieu, mais Il nous a fait faire partie de Sa famille, non par le processus naturel de conception humaine, mais par adoption. Nous n'étions pas des enfants, Dieu nous a adoptés. Le fils unique de Dieu est Jésus-Christ ; chair de sa chair, os de ses os, un avec lui, c'est Jésus. Mais parce que nous avons accepté Jésus-Christ comme notre Seigneur et Sauveur, Dieu est maintenant satisfait de nous pour nous faire devenir des enfants et maintenant nous sommes des enfants de Dieu \" Mais à tous ceux qui l'ont reçu, il leur a donné le pouvoir de devenir fils de Dieu, même à ceux qui croient en son nom. (Jean 1 verset 12). Ce que nous avons reçu est le salut, le pardon des péchés, la régénération, la réconciliation et l'adoption, toutes ces choses sont les mêmes. Nous n'étions pas des enfants mais Dieu a fait de nous des enfants et Jésus n'a pas honte de nous appeler ses frères. Nous n'étions pas les frères de Jésus avant, c'est l'adoption qui nous a donné ce droit. Et Dieu a mis Son Esprit en nous, le même Esprit qui était en Christ est maintenant en nous, nous rendant un et cet Esprit est appelé l'Esprit de filiation, qui crie en nous et nous dit que nous avons un Père ; nous l'appelons Abba Père; c'est l'adoption.     **\nDieu appela la nation Israël son fils, qu'il aimait Osée 11 verset 1 . Il a dit à Pharaon, Israël est mon fils, même mon premier-né Exode nous 4 verset 22 . Il a dit de Salomon, le fils de David, \"Je serai son père, et il sera mon fils. Deuxième Samuel 7 verset 14. Dieu lui-même a déterminé l'adoption des croyants comme enfants de Dieu. \" Selon qu'il nous a choisis en lui avant la fondation du monde, afin que nous soyons saints et irrépréhensibles devant lui en amour, nous ayant prédestinés à lui être adoptés par Jésus-Christ, selon le bon plaisir de sa volonté » (Ephésiens 1 versets 4 à 5 ) . Cette adoption n'est le résultat d'aucun travail ou mérite du croyant, mais uniquement de l'amour et de la grâce de Dieu. Faire entrer une personne dans une famille par voie d'adoption se fait par choix et par amour. Ephésiens 1 verset 5 , le dit ainsi, \"Dieu a décidé d'avance de nous adopter dans sa propre famille en nous amenant à lui par Jésus-Christ. C'est ce qu'il a voulu faire, et cela lui a fait grand plaisir. Cela a fait grand plaisir à Dieu de nous adopter enfants.  **\n Matthieu 1 verset 18 à 25    **\n« Or, la naissance de Jésus-Christ s'est faite ainsi, lorsque sa mère, Marie, a été fiancée à Joseph, avant qu'ils ne s'unissent, elle a été trouvée enceinte du Saint-Esprit.  **\nAlors Joseph, son mari, étant un homme juste et ne voulant pas en faire un exemple public, voulut la répudier en secret.\nMais pendant qu'il réfléchissait à ces choses, voici, l'ange du Seigneur lui apparut en songe, disant   Joseph, fils de David, ne crains pas de prendre avec toi Marie, ta femme, car ce qui est conçu en elle est de le Saint-Esprit.\nEt elle enfantera un fils, et tu appelleras son nom JÉSUS, car il sauvera son peuple de ses péchés.\nOr, tout cela fut fait, afin que s'accomplît ce qui avait été dit du Seigneur par le prophète, disant  \nVoici, une vierge sera enceinte, et enfantera un fils, et ils appelleront son nom Emmanuel, ce qui étant interprété est, Dieu avec nous.\nAlors Joseph, ressuscité, fit ce que l'ange du Seigneur lui avait ordonné, et prit sa femme auprès de lui  \nEt ne la connut pas jusqu'à ce qu'elle ait enfanté son fils premier-né; et il appela son nom JÉSUS.  **\nNotre Seigneur Jésus a été adopté et élevé par Joseph, le mari de sa mère, qui l'a pris comme son propre enfant. Dieu a choisi Son Fils pour être adopté. Si l'adoption était assez bonne pour le Fils de Dieu, alors c'est une bénédiction pour son peuple. Moïse, un grand prophète de Dieu, que Dieu a utilisé pour faire sortir/délivrer son peuple d'Égypte/de l'esclavage, a été adopté et élevé par la fille de Pharaon, qui l'a pris comme son fils et l'a nommé Moïse Exode 2 verset 1 à 10. Samuel, un autre grand prophète de Dieu, qui a jugé et conduit le peuple de Dieu à l'adorer, a été encouragé par Eli ( 1 Samuel 1 verset 20 à 28). Dieu a utilisé Esther pour délivrer son peuple ; elle a également été adoptée par son oncle Mardochée. De toute évidence, nous pouvons voir que l'adoption est bonne et acceptable aux yeux de Dieu. C'est absolument biblique.  **\nL'adoption peut aussi être appelée greffe comme on le voit dans Romains 11 verset 17. \n\"Et si quelques-unes des branches étaient cassées, et que toi, étant un olivier sauvage, tu étais greffé parmi eux, et avec eux partageais la racine et la graisse de l'olivier\".  **\n\nL'olivier avait des branches, mais une chance a été créée dans l'arbre soit en coupant une branche ou une partie du tronc et une autre y a été fixée ; il n'en faisait pas partie auparavant, mais maintenant il en fait partie et participe à la racine, à l'origine et jouit comme n'importe quelle autre branche ; c'est l'adoption. L'enfant adopté dans la famille a le même droit que tout autre enfant de la famille et revendique la même génération que tout autre enfant à la racine. C'est un privilège et c'est une bénédiction.  **\n  \nRaisons pour lesquelles l'adoption est une pratique bénie   **\n1   C'est un principe biblique par lequel nous devenons enfants de Dieu Ephésiens 1 verset 5.\n2   C'est l'une des manières dont Dieu accomplit Ses promesses de donner des enfants aux stériles.  **\nPsaumes 113 verset 9.  **\n« Il fait de la femme stérile une femme de ménage et une joyeuse\nmère d'enfants. Louez le Seigneur.     **\nC'est le choix de Dieu lequel utiliser. Ils disent 'votre utérus a été enlevé; ton ventre est bouché et c'est pourquoi tu ne peux pas donner naissance à un enfant ». Le Seigneur décide de répondre par une autre voie. Pour vous le faire savoir, c'est un mensonge du diable qui dit que vous ne pouvez pas être une mère d'enfants. Dieu vous a donné un enfant; c'est un enfant adopté mais c'est un enfant; avoir droit dans votre vie, avoir droit devant Dieu comme n'importe lequel de vos enfants naturels. Peut-être avez-vous d'autres enfants et recherchez-vous une fille ou un garçon, et le Seigneur est passé par cette autre voie pour répondre à votre prière; l'enfant est adopté mais a les mêmes droits que les autres enfants de la maison. Vos autres enfants n'en sont peut-être même pas conscients. C'est l'accomplissement des promesses de Dieu dans votre vie. Par conséquent , si Dieu utilise ce moyen pour accomplir Sa promesse, ne soyez pas trop grand pour cela. Sinon, c'est votre ignorance et votre fierté qui sont à l'œuvre et \"la fierté précède la chute\". Il se peut que vous n'ayez pas connu la parole de Dieu jusqu'à présent, que Dieu puisse utiliser cette méthode. Le Saint-Esprit a peut-être incité votre cœur à adopter cette méthode et vous avez dit non   « Je dois attendre que ce soit le mien ». Qu'ils soient les vôtres ou n'importe lequel d'entre eux, ils viennent de Dieu. Dieu est le père des enfants; C'est lui qui donne des enfants, écoutez-le.  **\n3   Cela fait partie des façons dont Dieu montre de la compassion envers les orphelins sur terre. Sinon, comment pensez-vous que ce sera pour certaines personnes ; certaines personnes naissent avec un grand désavantage.  **\nEzéchiel 16 verset 3 à 6   **\n« Et dis   Ainsi parle le Seigneur Dieu à Jérusalem ; Ta naissance et ta nativité sont du pays de Canaan ; ton père était un Amoréen, et ta mère une Hittite.\nEt quant à ta naissance, le jour de ta naissance ton nombril n'a pas été coupé, et tu n'as pas été lavé dans l'eau pour t'assouplir ; tu n'as pas été salé du tout, ni emmailloté du tout.\nAucun œil n'a eu pitié de toi pour te faire quoi que ce soit de cela, pour avoir pitié de toi; mais tu as été jeté en plein champ, c'est ce que les femmes sans cœur, les prostituées font à certains de ces enfants, au dégoût de ta personne, le jour où tu es né.\nEt quand je suis passé près de toi, et que je t'ai vu souillé par ton propre sang, je t'ai dit quand tu étais dans ton sang   Vis ; oui, je t'ai dit quand tu étais dans ton sang   Vis.  **\n\nIls ont été chassés pour mourir mais Dieu ne leur a pas permis de mourir ; Il les fit cueillir et confier à une famille   « Quand mon père et ma mère m'abandonneront, alors le Seigneur me prendra » . Psaumes 27 verset 10 . L'adoption accomplit cela, sinon ces enfants périront tout simplement. Savez-vous ce qu'ils deviendront pour Dieu ? Ne sont-ils pas des êtres humains comme vous et moi ? L'adoption d'enfants est la volonté de Dieu. S'il vous dit de résoudre ce problème, si c'est dans votre cœur, afin que les enfants qui ont été abandonnés par des parents méchants soient livrés et aient un foyer, faites-le et alors ils loueront Dieu en ce jour-là. Quand nous arriverons au ciel, les gens auront de nombreuses raisons de louer le Seigneur. Ces enfants adoptés auront une raison de louer Dieu. Alors pourquoi résistez-vous à la voie de Dieu ? D'autres essaient même d'utiliser la Bible pour résister à l'adoption comme si Dieu irait contre lui-même dans sa parole.  **\n4  C'est une stratégie de gain d'âme lorsque les parents adoptifs sont croyants. Une stratégie gagnante d'âme car cet enfant a maintenant le privilège de connaître Jésus. L'enfant peut être d'une famille païenne ou d'une famille d'une autre religion mais la précieuse grâce de Dieu l'a mis entre vos mains, afin qu'il goûte lui aussi la vie éternelle par votre travail car vous allez évangéliser. Le diable veut détruire ces âmes dans les pays occidentaux et développés ; Les orphelinats chrétiens y ferment parce que les homosexuels et les lesbiennes adoptent des enfants et sont fortement soutenus par leur gouvernement. Selon vous, quel sera l'avenir de ces enfants ? Si c'est, même, toute l'âme que vous pouvez apporter à Dieu, alors vous n'irez pas au paradis les mains vides. Je pense que dans certains pays occidentaux, lorsqu'une personne a fini de donner naissance à des enfants, les enfants partent pour aller à l'école ou se débrouiller seuls. Les parents seraient laissés seuls, alors ils iraient adopter un autre enfant. Cela devient une bénédiction; c'est gagner l'âme.  **\n1   L'adoption répond également à la définition de la vraie religion. Jacques 1 verset\n27 \"La religion qui est pure et sans souillure devant Dieu, le Père, est celle-ci   visiter les orphelins et les veuves dans leur affliction, et se garder sans souillure du monde. \"Visit\" ici est beaucoup plus profond et plus actif que les Anglais ne le suggèrent. . Cela signifie prendre soin de, prendre soin de, pourvoir, fournir les choses nécessaires.  **  \n2   L'adoption est, pour certains, une vocation à démultiplier leur impact en tant que parents en élargissant leur famille avec des enfants qui ne sont pas les leurs, biologiquement.  **\n3   C'est la victoire dans le combat spirituel contre le diable, dont le but est de voler, tuer et détruire l'âme. Satan avait voulu détruire une âme, détruire les gens qui n'ont pas d'enfant en les rendant agités ou en les rendant sans paix, mais le Seigneur a fait d'eux des parents joyeux d'un enfant ou d'enfants. Satan est vaincu, cette agitation et ces pleurs ont cessé. Maintenant un enfant pleure dans la famille, maintenant un enfant est dans sa main, elle est maintenant mère d'enfants. L'affaire est terminée, la bataille est bouclée et Satan n'a plus rien à dire, il est parti. C'est l'œuvre de Dieu.  **\n4   C'est une bénédiction pour le mariage quand Dieu accorde ce privilège à un couple marié avec ou sans enfants. Si Dieu vous donne cette mission, parce que les enfants sont la bénédiction du Seigneur, ne dites pas que j'ai déjà des enfants, s'il vous plaît, prenez-le et faites-le pour Dieu. Rappelez-vous que Moïse était un enfant adopté. A supposer que le principe de l'adoption soit rejeté, un grand personnage de ce monde, un des héros de ce monde, serait perdu. Rappelez-vous qu'Esther a également été adoptée par Mardochée et qu'elle est devenue la libératrice de la vie de Mardochée et de toute la nation. Pourquoi refusez-vous un enfant adopté ? Connaissez-vous la bénédiction qu'il/elle apportera à vous et à la nation ?  **  \n \nModes d'adoption   **\nLes méthodes d'adoption peuvent différer d'un pays ou d'un État à l'autre. Ce n'est pas sans travail ! Il faut neuf mois à une femme pour mettre un bébé au monde. Les adoptants doivent donc être prêts à suivre les procédures nécessaires ou à remplir les conditions nécessaires pour adopter un bébé. Le/les futur(s) parent(s) adoptif(s) doivent s'adresser aux autorités compétentes de leur pays pour obtenir de plus amples informations, par exemple, au Nigeria, le\nLe Ministère de la Jeunesse et des Sports est en charge de l'adoption.\nLa méthode de sécurisation de l'enfant doit être exempte de mensonge, de trahison et de mal. L'enfant adopté doit bénéficier d'un maximum de sécurité et d'intimité, ne pas être exposé au ridicule, à la honte ou aux mauvais traitements. N'oubliez pas que l'intégration d'une personne dans une famille par le biais de l'adoption se fait par choix et par amour. « Dieu a décidé d'avance de nous adopter dans sa propre famille en nous amenant à lui par Jésus-Christ. C'est ce qu'il voulait faire, et cela lui a fait grand plaisir. (Ephésiens 1 verset 5).  **\nL'adoption est un acte d'amour. Cela doit venir d'un désir d'aimer un enfant. Elle doit être motivée par notre amour pour Dieu. Ce doit être parce que nous voulons élever un enfant pour Dieu comme une démonstration de notre amour pour Dieu. Chaque enfant est un don de Dieu. Chaque enfant est un objet de notre amour pour Dieu et pour l'humanité. Donc, si vous voulez adopter un enfant, soyez prêt à l'aimer pour le reste de vos jours. Soyez prêt à être responsable du succès de cet enfant. Soyez prêt à être un bon intendant du cadeau. Chaque enfant est un cadeau pour l'humanité et s'il est bien nourri, il améliorera la race humaine.  ** \nAlors que différents couples/familles peuvent avoir leur propre raison ou motivation pour explorer l'adoption, le cœur du désir d'une famille d'adopter et ce qui pousse cette famille à mener à bien une adoption, devrait être basé sur ce qui suit      **\n1   Le désir de donner une famille à un enfant – La future famille adoptive veut offrir à un enfant un foyer et une famille aimants. Cela comprend tout ce qui fait d'un foyer un endroit où il fait bon vivre et d'une famille qui est un groupe accueillant. Cela signifie accepter l'enfant pour ce qu'il est - même ses défauts. Comprendre que l'enfant a une histoire et un héritage qui doivent également être respectés et embrassés.  **\n2   Le désir d'aider un enfant à avancer dans la vie. – Les parents adoptifs ont intérêt à aider un enfant à guérir du chagrin et de la douleur passés, qu'ils proviennent d'abus, de négligence, d'abandon ou d'orphelin. La famille adoptive veut aider l'enfant à commencer une nouvelle vie et sait qu'il y aura des hauts et des bas avec la parentalité adoptive et est préparée à ces défis.  **\n3  La capacité de subvenir aux besoins d'un autre enfant de toutes les manières - Le futur parent adoptif veut partager sa maison avec un enfant et avoir l'espace physique pour un autre enfant. Ils ont également le temps et l'espace émotionnel dans leur cœur pour un nouveau membre de la famille. La famille adoptive doit également être suffisamment sécurisée financièrement pour adopter confortablement.    **\n4  Toute la famille adoptive accepte l'adoption - Le mari et la femme doivent être d'accord sur cette question. Dans le cas où l'enfant adopté sera un enfant supplémentaire, alors, tous les membres de la famille doivent être informés et convenir que l'ajout à la maison par l'adoption est la bonne chose à faire. Tous les enfants de la maison devraient être enthousiastes à l'idée d'adopter. Certains couples noirs adoptent un enfant blanc et vice versa afin que toute la famille soit d'accord pour l'adoption. Cependant, lorsque l'enfant adopté est le premier, les frères et sœurs n'ont pas besoin de le savoir. Chaque secret doit être gardé pendant qu'il grandit afin que les gens ne l'abusent pas, en particulier dans notre société africaine. Ne permettez pas cela. Vos enfants ne doivent rien savoir à ce sujet, sauf s'ils ne le savent en aucun cas, sinon il n'est pas nécessaire de connaître les enfants. Ne permettez pas à votre famille élargie de maltraiter l'enfant. C'est votre vie privée et c'est comme ça que ça devrait être.  **\n1   La famille adoptive connaît un enfant qui a besoin d'une famille – La future famille adoptive est au courant d'un enfant qui a besoin d'un foyer adoptif. L'enfant peut être un ami de la famille, un parent ou un enfant rencontré à l'église ou dans le quartier.\nEn conclusion, si l'adoption était assez bonne pour le Fils de Dieu, alors c'est une bénédiction pour Son peuple.  **\n \nChapitre cinq   Planification familiale   **\n \nColossiens 3 verset 15 à 16.  **\n« Et que la paix de Dieu règne dans vos cœurs, à laquelle vous êtes aussi appelés en un seul corps ; et soyez reconnaissants.\nLaissez la parole du Christ habiter en vous richement en toute sagesse; enseignez-vous et exhortez-vous les uns les autres par des psaumes, des hymnes et des cantiques spirituels, chantant avec grâce dans vos cœurs pour le Seigneur.  \nQue la parole du Christ habite en vous richement. C'est à mesure que la parole est riche que la sagesse de celle-ci apparaîtra. La quantité et la richesse de la parole produisent la sagesse. C'est la parole de Dieu.  **\nL'importance et la nécessité de la planification familiale\nBien que Dieu désire que nous ayons des enfants, il attend de nous que nous fassions preuve de sagesse à cet égard. Pourquoi? La sagesse est la chose principale. Voir dans Proverbes 4 verset 5 à 9  \n« Obtenez la sagesse, obtenez la compréhension, ne l'oubliez pas ; ni déclin des paroles de ma bouche.\nNe l'abandonne pas, et elle te gardera ; aime-la, et elle te gardera.\nLa sagesse est la chose principale; acquiers donc la sagesse   et avec tout ce que tu as acquis, acquiers l'intelligence.\nExalte-la, et elle te fera grandir, elle t'honorera, quand tu l'embrasseras.\nElle donnera à ta tête un ornement de grâce   elle te remettra une couronne de gloire.  **\nAppliquez la sagesse dans la vie, vous aurez les avantages de cette vie si vous le faites. Dieu veut que vous ayez des enfants mais il veut que vous soyez sage. Les enfants, pour le parent, sont aussi bons que le miel. Cela réjouit le cœur, la personne est heureuse de dire   « J'ai des enfants ou ce sont mes enfants ». Ils sont bons et rendent heureux. Que dit la Bible d'une chose aussi bonne que le miel ? Proverbes 24 verset 13 à 14, « 13. Mon fils, mange du miel, car il est bon ; et le rayon de miel, qui est doux à ton goût. Dieu vous a-t-il donné la chance d'avoir des enfants ? Très bien, donne naissance à des enfants. Vous avez déjà eu les deux premiers ? C'est bien, nous remercions Dieu. Vous attendez le troisième ? Belle, \" mon fils mange du miel car le miel est bon.\" Donner naissance à des enfants; ça c'est bon. \"14. Ainsi sera la connaissance de la sagesse pour ton âme   quand tu l'auras trouvée, alors il y aura une récompense, et ton attente ne sera pas anéantie. Les bénédictions viennent des enfants ; les bénédictions viennent du miel. Mais ce n'est pas seulement cette partie que la Bible a quelque chose à dire en ce qui concerne le miel. Proverbes 25 16. « As-tu trouvé du miel ? mange autant qu'il te suffit, de peur d'en être rassasié et de le vomir. La même écriture qui dit, mangez du miel, le miel est bon vous dit que si vous ne contrôlez pas la quantité de miel sucré que vous prenez, vous en haïrez chaque goutte dans votre estomac. Si vous ne contrôlez pas la quantité que vous mangez, vous détesterez le tout. Qui aime voir son vomi ? Si vous ne contrôlez pas le nombre d' enfants que vous portez, vous finirez par détester le fait d'avoir donné naissance à quelqu'un. Aussi bons soient-ils, « ils me rendent heureux, je suis fier d'eux », dites-vous, contrôlez le nombre d'enfants que vous portez. Regardez-le encore dans Proverbes 25 verbes 27, \"Il n'est pas bon de manger beaucoup de miel   ainsi, pour les hommes, rechercher leur propre gloire n'est pas la gloire.\" Il est très clair que \"Ce n'est pas bon\" compte tenu de ces nos jours. A l'époque où l'on s'adonne à l'agriculture, il était bon que ton carquois soit rempli d'enfants car ils iront à la ferme. Ensuite, un homme pourrait avoir une très grande ferme parce qu'il a des enfants qui travailleront avec lui dans la ferme, mais de nos jours, la nourriture est achetée avec de l'argent et tout le monde mange très gros et les enfants mangent d'une manière qui surprend. Qu'est-il arrivé à leur estomac ? Il est probablement agrandi. Si vous ne contrôlez pas le nombre d'enfants que vous avez, votre vie sera dans la confusion. Qu'en est-il des frais de scolarité, lequel envoyez-vous à l'école et lequel n'enverrez-vous pas ? Vous voulez être partiel ? Si non, comment obtenez-vous l'argent pour payer les frais de scolarité de tout le monde ? \"Que la parole de Dieu habite en vous richement en toute sagesse.\" \"La sagesse est la chose principale donc obtenez la sagesse.\" Comment payez-vous les frais de scolarité ? Qu'en est-il des maladies, quand vous aurez besoin de les soigner ? Finalement, vous êtes tellement épuisé que votre vie chrétienne en est affectée et que cela vous manque. Ne seriez-vous donc pas sage ? Y a-t-il un commandement qui te dit le nombre d'enfants que tu dois avoir ? C'est la même chose que de dire à une femme chrétienne et à un mari chrétien de ne pas utiliser telle ou telle méthode dans leurs relations amoureuses. Aucune méthode n'est interdite dans les Écritures que nous connaissons, sauf celles qui sont complètement issues d'esprits vils, plutôt l'Écriture dit de profiter du plaisir avec la femme de votre jeunesse. Profitez du plaisir de quelque manière que ce soit, mais nous vous avons dit de ne pas abandonner l'utilisation naturelle.  **\nLe Seigneur ne t'a pas dit combien d'enfants tu as. Pourquoi Abraham n'a-t-il pas eu plus que le nombre d'enfants qu'il avait ? Pourquoi Isaac n'en avait-il pas plus de deux ? Pourquoi Joseph n'en avait-il pas plus de deux ? Pourquoi Moïse n'en avait-il pas plus de deux ? Pourquoi pas? Ont-ils donc péché ? Le contrôle est entre vos mains selon votre sagesse. Si vous utilisez bien votre sagesse, vous irez au ciel. Nous venons de publier un livre intitulé « La clé de votre vie est dans votre main » . Si vous n'utilisez pas bien votre sagesse, vous irez en enfer mais utilisez bien votre sagesse. Aussi bons que soient les enfants, peu ont les ressources pour en avoir beaucoup. Il est conseillé d'avoir un nombre suffisant dont vous pouvez vous occuper tout en restant juste et fidèle devant Dieu. Nous devons être sages et non insensés étant donné les jours où nous sommes. Éphésiens 5 verset 15 à 17, 15 « Veillez donc à marcher avec circonspection, non comme des insensés, mais comme des sages, 16 rachetant le temps, car les jours sont mauvais. 17 C'est pourquoi ne soyez pas inconsidérés, mais comprenez quelle est la volonté du Seigneur » à cet égard. Combien ont été infidèles à Dieu maintenant ? Combien se sont retirés de Dieu maintenant à cause des enfants ? Combien ont été touchés de diverses manières ? Quel cri entendez-vous maintenant de vos parents à la fois en Christ et en dehors de Christ ? Qu'entendez-vous des enfants dans la société ? Qu'entendez-vous arriver aux enfants dans d'autres pays développés ? Sois sage. Sachez et comprenez quelle est la volonté de Dieu dans votre vie en ce moment. C'est donc la vraie sagesse de réduire le nombre d'enfants que vous enfanterez. Pourquoi? \"Un homme prudent prévoit le mal et se cache.\" (Proverbes 22 verset 3). Après avoir vu ce que certains enfants font subir à leurs parents, on peut décider de ne pas en avoir trop. En fait, il sera raisonnable pour tout ministre de savoir que donner naissance à trop d'enfants n'est pas favorable au ministère chrétien. Il est tout naturel que le ministre chrétien sache cela. Ce n'est pas favorable. Si vous l'avez déjà fait, dans votre ignorance, plaidez à cause de votre ignorance devant Dieu. Car pourquoi gaspillerez-vous toute votre vie sur terre, pour un peuple dont vous ne savez même pas s'il ira ou non au ciel. Salomon, dans la Bible, a dit que l'une des choses qui le troublait était que, lorsqu'il considérait toutes les richesses qu'il avait rassemblées et qu'il les laisserait à quelqu'un qui pourrait être un imbécile; cela le troublait. Alors quel est le besoin même de rassembler ces choses quand finalement un imbécile prendra le relais. A quoi je perds mon temps ? pensa Salomon. Il est donc sage de contrôler la procréation.  **\nMaintenant qu'il est clair que la planification familiale/le contrôle des naissances est nécessaire, comment cela peut-il être fait ? Certains diraient   prends-le par la foi et va devant le Seigneur et prie en disant   « Dieu, nous allons bien, arrête ça maintenant. Cela arrive, Dieu peut l'arrêter. Mais tout le monde n'a pas une telle foi. Peu de gens peuvent empêcher le soleil de se coucher, nous n'orienterons donc pas tout le monde dans cette direction. Cela arrive avec parcimonie. Cela peut arriver ici et là par la foi, la prière peut arrêter de procréer. Mais ne dites pas à chaque homme malade qu'il doit prier pour sa maladie et ne jamais prendre de médicaments \" ... tous les hommes n'ont pas la foi\", (2 Thessaloniciens 3 verset 2), c'est pourquoi Dieu a fourni des médicaments. Les gens qui sont imprudents et insensés prient contre les médicaments. Pourquoi ne prient-ils pas contre d'autres inventions scientifiques que Dieu nous a données ? Pourquoi utilisent-ils le téléphone ? Pourquoi entrent-ils dans un véhicule pour voyager ? Pourquoi entrent-ils dans l'avion ? C'est le même Dieu qui a donné la connaissance. A l'un, Il donna la connaissance des véhicules. A l'autre la connaissance de la médecine. À l'autre, la connaissance des aliments et c'est ainsi que le monde a évolué. Comment allez-vous maintenant dire que vous ne voulez pas de médicaments ? C'est essentiel, Dieu leur a tout donné tant qu'ils ne sont pas destinés à détruire.  **\n \nMéthodes de Planification Familiale   **\nLes conseils médicaux deviennent importants, « sans conseil les buts sont déçus   mais dans la multitude des conseillers, ils sont établis ». Proverbes 15 verset 22 . Il y a certaines méthodes que les gens appliquent, certains disent qu'ils utilisent la méthode de retrait pour que le sperme ne soit pas répandu à l'intérieur de la femme mais à l'extérieur et de cette façon, ils sont capables de contrôler les situations mais d'autres s'y opposent et disent que ce n'est pas scripturaire, c'est pourquoi doit ils le font. Pourquoi doivent-ils se retirer ?\nQue dans la Bible, Onan a été tué par le Seigneur parce qu'il s'est renversé.  **\n\nGenèse 38 verset 8 à 9.  **\n«Et Juda dit à Onan  Va vers la femme de ton frère, épouse-la et suscite une postérité à ton frère.\nEt Onan savait que la semence ne devait pas être la sienne ; Et Onan savait que la semence ne devait pas être la sienne.    **\nOnan est mort par manque d'amour, il est mort parce qu'il n'aimait pas son prochain, il n'a pas obéi à son père, il n'a pas aimé son frère ; il était égoïste. \"Et il arriva, lorsqu'il entra chez la femme de son frère, qu'il le renversa par terre, de peur qu'il ne donne de la semence à son frère.\" Pouvez-vous voir où est la méchanceté; il n'a pas été tué parce qu'il l'a renversé dehors mais parce qu'il était méchant. Le verset 10 dit  \"Et ce qu'il fit déplut au Seigneur  c'est pourquoi il le tua aussi.\" Maintenant, ce qu'il a fait était de la méchanceté, c'est pourquoi le Seigneur l'a tué. Pourquoi l'Éternel a-t-il tué son frère au verset 7 «Et Er, premier-né de Juda, était méchant aux yeux de l'Éternel; et le Seigneur le tua. Ce qui a causé tous ces meurtres, c'est la méchanceté, pour avoir refusé de faire du bien à un autre homme, pour avoir endurci le cœur. Ce n'est pas que lorsque votre sperme tombe, vous avez péché non, vous n'avez pas péché. Si la méthode de retrait vous sert c'est bien, allez-y, ce n'est pas dans la méchanceté. Ce n'est pas de la méchanceté contre votre femme, ce n'est pas de la méchanceté contre une autre personne. C'est parce que vous voulez vous en tenir à la sagesse scripturaire qui vous a conseillé, afin de contrôler le nombre d'enfants que vous avez, ce n'est pas un péché. Mais le faire dans la masturbation, dans le plaisir de vous-même afin que vous puissiez vous libérer, est un péché. Quelqu'un est venu me confesser son péché une fois et m'a dit qu'il s'était masturbé avec sa femme. Alors j'ai demandé, qu'est-ce qu'il veut dire, de quelle manière, comment c'est arrivé? Puis il a dit que la femme était à l'hôpital ce jour-là, il était allongé sur le lit, il était occupé à se concentrer sur la femme à l'hôpital et il a commencé à se frotter le corps puis à se masturber. Je lui ai dit de laisser sa femme en dehors de l'affaire, il a péché. Quel était son but ? Faire plaisir. Il a dû amener son esprit à un état de plaisir, lui seul et c'est une souillure. Nous ne le faisons pas alors pourquoi le faites-vous ? À cet égard, vous péchez. Cependant, parfois dans un rêve, quelque rêve provoquant peut vous faire lâcher prise ; vous vous réveillez et vous voyez mouillé sur votre lit, ce n'est pas un péché parce que votre volonté n'était pas impliquée ; vous ne l'avez pas planifié ni pensé, cela pourrait être naturel ou une manipulation satanique; en vous levant, nettoyez-vous, priez contre cela, résistez-y ; \"Résistez au diable et il fuira loin de vous.\" (Jacques 4 verset 7).  **\nLa planification familiale étant indispensable pour contrôler la procréation, le couple doit consulter un médecin. La méthode ne doit pas être celle qui tue un enfant déjà formé. Quelle que soit la méthode que vous utilisez, ce ne devrait pas être celle qui fait de vous un meurtrier. Certains utilisent des préservatifs, ça va si ça vous satisfait. En tout, toute méthode qui convient à la fois à l'homme et à la femme et qui n'est pas une offense à Dieu, en particulier ne pas tuer un enfant déjà formé, qui est conseillée, qui est propre, qui est juste, est acceptée. Vous pouvez dire, 'cette méthode va m'affecter, c'est risqué, et ça va faire ceci et cela'. Dites-moi la chose dans la vie qui n'est pas risquée, quelle est cette chose dans la vie que vous faites qui manque de risque ? Même l'eau potable comporte des risques tels que si vous ne la buvez pas avec précaution, elle risque de passer par le mauvais chemin. Le risque fait partie de la vie, mais nous gérons le risque et avançons et nous vivons. Par conséquent, utilisez la méthode qui convient à la femme, mais la sagesse doit également y entrer. Il n'est pas sage pour vous de dire   « Allons enlever l'utérus ». La femme est encore jeune et dans les événements de la vie, le mari peut mourir et elle peut avoir besoin d'épouser un autre homme, alors pourquoi retirez-vous l'utérus ? Qui vous a dit que vous vivriez ensemble jusqu'à la vieillesse ? Apportez-le à Dieu dans la prière, il vous guidera. Le Seigneur veut votre paix.\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Le salut des autres réside également dans la vérité de l'Écriture et entre nos mains. Comme nous connaissons cette vérité pour notre propre salut, nous la connaissons aussi pour le salut des autres.\nLe mariage n'est pas une découverte de l'homme, mais une institution que Dieu a établie de Lui-même sur la terre. Elle n'a été découverte par aucune société primitive ou moderne, mais Dieu l'a instituée. Si Dieu a institué le mariage, comme nous le disons ainsi, alors les principes de son fonctionnement reposent sur Lui. Tout ce qui concerne le mariage, nous devons Lui demander car Lui seul en est l'initiateur et le visionnaire. C'est pourquoi nous voulons laisser Dieu nous parler naturellement dans sa parole sur le mariage. Alors, laissez Dieu parler exactement de ce qu'est le mariage.  **\n\nGenèse 2 verset 18 à 25   **\n« Et le Seigneur Dieu dit   Il n'est pas bon que l'homme soit seul ; Je lui ferai une aide pour lui. Et du sol, le Seigneur Dieu forma toutes les bêtes des champs et tous les oiseaux du ciel; et les amena à Adam pour voir comment il les appellerait. Et tout ce qu'Adam appelait chaque créature vivante, c'était son nom. Et Adam donna des noms à tout le bétail, et aux oiseaux du ciel, et à toutes les bêtes des champs ; mais pour Adam, il n'y a pas eu d' aide digne de lui. Et le Seigneur Dieu fit tomber un profond sommeil sur Adam et il s'endormit   et il prit une de ses côtes, et referma la chair à sa place ; Et la côte que le Seigneur Dieu avait prise à l'homme, fit de lui une femme, et l'amena à l'homme. Et Adam dit   Ceci est maintenant l'os de mes os et la chair de ma chair ; on l'appellera Femme, parce qu'elle a été prise de l'homme. C'est pourquoi l'homme quittera son père et sa mère, et s'attachera à sa femme, et ils deviendront un chair. Et ils étaient tous les deux nus, l'homme et sa femme, et n'avaient pas honte .  **\n\nMatthieu 19 verset 3 à 11   **\n« Les pharisiens vinrent aussi à lui, le tentant, et lui disant   Est -il permis à un homme de répudier sa femme pour n'importe quelle cause ? Et il répondit et leur dit   N'avez -vous pas lu que celui qui les a faits au commencement les a faits mâle et femelle, et a dit   C'est pourquoi l'homme quittera son père et sa mère, et s'attachera à sa femme et ils twain sera une seule chair? C'est pourquoi ils ne sont plus deux, mais une seule chair. Ce que Dieu a donc uni, que l'homme ne le sépare pas. Ils lui dirent   Pourquoi Moïse a-t-il alors ordonné de donner un écrit de répudiation et de la répudier ? Il leur dit   Moïse, à cause de l'endurcissement de votre cœur, vous a permis de répudier vos femmes, mais dès le commencement il n'en fut pas ainsi. Et je vous le dis, quiconque répudie sa femme, si ce n'est pour fornication, et en épouse une autre, commet un adultère, et quiconque épouse une femme répudiée commet un adultère. Ses disciples lui disent  Si le cas de l'homme est ainsi avec sa femme, il n'est pas bon de se marier. Mais il leur dit   Tous les hommes ne peuvent recevoir cette parole, sauf ceux à qui elle est donné.\"   **\n  \nRegardons à nouveau Genèse 2 verset 23 à 25 « Et Adam dit, ceci est maintenant l'os de mes os et la chair de ma chair   » Vous pouvez voir l'unité ici. Adam, le premier homme, a témoigné de l'unité entre un homme et sa femme. Votre arrière-arrière-arrière-grand-père, Adam, le premier homme créé, a témoigné qu'un homme ne fait qu'un avec sa femme. En fait , la femme fait partie de l'homme. Et la femme dont il parlait ici est la seule femme disponible. Ainsi , lorsque Jésus a parlé contre le divorce, c'était naturel parce que ce n'était pas dans la pensée de Dieu. Il ne l'a pas prévu. Dieu n'a pas prévu un autre homme pour une femme mariée ou une autre femme pour un homme marié. Adam le savait. Il a dit   « Elle sera appelée Femme, parce qu'elle a été tirée de l'Homme. C'est pourquoi l'homme quittera son père et sa mère----- ». Ce verset montre que le mariage a été institué pour être une affaire mondiale. C'est une prophétie concernant le mariage futur, qu'il y aura des hommes et des femmes sur terre et que le mariage aura lieu entre eux. Comment sera-ce? « ----- un homme quittera son père et sa mère----- ». Cela parle aussi de maturité et de séparation. Cela signifie que lorsqu'un homme est mûr pour se marier, il va chercher sa propre femme. La femme ne doit pas rester dans la maison de son père – non ; la femme est faite pour l'homme. C'est l'homme qui doit « quitter son père et sa mère » (séparation) pour s'attacher à sa femme et les deux deviendront une seule chair.  **\nEt donc nous voyons dans le passage, 'Partir' 'Fendre' 'Une seule chair.' « Partir » signifie quitter son père et sa mère pour ne plus être sous leur contrôle. En tant qu'homme marié, vous avez mûri et avez obtenu votre indépendance vis-à-vis de votre père et de votre mère. Vous formez une nation à vous dont vous êtes le président. \"Partir\" est essentiel. Beaucoup de ceux qui ne sont pas partis après s'être mariés mais sont restés dans la même maison avec leurs parents n'ont pas trouvé la paix. Pourquoi? C'est parce qu'ils ne sont pas partis. Le mot dit, laisse le contrôle de ton père et de ta mère car la maison où tu es, a déjà un chef et il ne peut y avoir deux chefs dans la même maison. Maintenant, vous avez obtenu un établissement dans lequel vous êtes censé être le chef, mais vous ne pouvez pas exercer votre direction parce que vous êtes là où quelqu'un est déjà à la tête, donc il y aura un conflit. Il n'y aura pas de liberté et vous ne pourrez pas exprimer votre esprit, votre femme n'aura pas de vraie liberté parce qu'elle est sous quelqu'un. Elle doit être sous-chef, mais il y a déjà un sous-chef avant elle, elle ne peut donc pas exercer sa fonction. Il y aura toujours des difficultés, des problèmes, de l'amertume, de la colère, des murmures, des insuffisances, des ennuis, des combats et des querelles. Lorsque vous constatez que cela se passe, obéissez aux Écritures. Pour ceux qui ne se sont pas encore mariés, accomplissez cette Écriture lorsque vous vous mariez. Dans le cas où vous êtes déjà marié et toujours sous le contrôle de vos parents, allez et accomplissez l'Écriture. Sinon, cela affectera votre vie chrétienne, car l'homme qui est votre chef (votre père) peut ne pas naître de nouveau. Même s'il est né de nouveau, le Seigneur n'a pas dit qu'il devrait être votre chef à cet égard. Allez trouver votre maison ; c'est « partir ». Voir Matthieu 19 verset 4 à 7 encore \"Et il répondit et leur dit  N'avez -vous pas lu que celui qui les a faits au commencement les a faits mâle et femelle, et a dit  C'est pourquoi l'homme quittera son père et sa mère- ----\". Notez l'emphase, 'laisser.' Au cas où vous et votre femme êtes sous vos parents et avez des difficultés, souvenez-vous de l'Écriture, partez. Cela signifie qu'il y a une Écriture à laquelle vous n'avez pas obéi. Quelqu'un a dit un jour   « Au cas où ton père serait en retard et que ta mère serait encore en vie et que tu devrais rester avec ta mère parce que c'est toi qui t'occuperas d'elle, je suggérerais que tu quittes quand même cette maison et que tu emmènes ta mère avec toi. dans une autre maison qu'elle n'a pas contribué à construire ». C'est alors que vous avez complètement vaincu la question. Sinon, la racine est toujours là ; elle a construit cette maison, elle était là avant qu'aucune femme n'entre dans cette maison et elle est à la tête de n'importe quelle femme là-bas, en fait, y compris n'importe quel homme là-bas. Donc, c'est la sagesse, que vous LAISSEZ.  **\nIl y a « clivage » ; le mari et la femme se réunissant. Ce « clivage » en dit long sur les rapports sexuels qui auront lieu entre l'homme et sa femme. Il parle de l'intimité qui réalise la « seule chair ». Nous en apprendrons plus au fur et à mesure que nous avancerons. « C'est pourquoi l'homme quittera son père et sa mère et s'attachera à sa femme et ils deviendront une seule chair. Ils étaient tous les deux nus, l'homme et sa femme, et n'avaient pas honte. C'est encore parler de « l'Unité ». Vous ne devez donc pas avoir honte de votre corps ; tu es une.  **\n\nChapitre deux   Aucune disposition relative au divorce ou à la polygamie dans le mariage.  **\n \nMatthieu 19 versets 4 à 5    **\n\"Et il répondit et leur dit   N'avez -vous pas lu que celui qui les a faits au commencement les a faits mâle et femelle, et a dit   C'est pourquoi l'homme quittera son père et sa mère, et s'attachera à sa femme et ils deux seront une seule chair ?   **\n'Twain' parle ici de deux et non de trois. La polygamie n'est pas possible car « une seule chair » ne peut pas être entre un homme et deux ou trois femmes. et les deux deviendront une seule chair? C'est pourquoi ils ne sont plus deux, mais une seule chair. Dieu dit, ils ne sont plus deux. C'est toi qui les vois comme deux. Dieu ne les voit plus comme deux, mais comme une seule chair. \"Ce que Dieu a donc uni, que l'homme ne le sépare pas.\" C'est absolument l'affaire de Dieu. Le mariage est absolument l'affaire de Dieu. N'y touchez donc pas ; prenez-le tel qu'Il le présente. Vous n'êtes plus deux qui peuvent être divisés. Vous vous séparez et dites que vous allez en épouser un autre ; c'est parce que vous pensez que vous êtes deux. Si en épouser un autre était possible, alors c'est vous et votre femme qui en épouserez un autre parce que vous êtes une seule chair. Vous savez, ce sont Sarah et Abraham qui ont épousé Agar; peut-être que vous n'êtes pas au courant de cela. Agar ne doit jamais s'interposer entre ces deux-là parce qu'ils ne font qu'un. En cas de problème, c'est Hagar qui devra partir; c'est ce que cela signifie. Combien plus maintenant, le mariage n'est plus possible avec un autre; c'est deux qui sont devenus un. \"Ce que Dieu a donc uni, que l'homme ne le sépare pas.\" Si le tribunal les sépare, Dieu les jugera. Vous pouvez dire que c'est la loi du gouvernement. Qui a donné le gouvernement? \"Le gouvernement reposera sur son épaule\" . Ainsi, le gouvernement du monde ne doit pas s'écarter de Lui (le donneur de gouvernement). Si une Église met en pièces, Dieu jugera l'autorité de cette église parce qu'ils ont mis en pièces ce que Dieu a fait. C'est Dieu qui les a rejoints; le Dieu d'éternité l'a fait. Vous pouvez dire qu'ils ne sont pas nés de nouveau lorsqu'ils ont été rejoints. Abraham et Sarah ne sont jamais nés de nouveau lorsqu'ils se sont mariés, mais Dieu les a rejoints et le monde d'aujourd'hui est béni par Abraham et Sarah ; c'est la sagesse de Dieu.  **\nVous pouvez dire, 'ma femme est une femme terriblement méchante'. Le Dieu qui a vu sa méchanceté et a permis qu'elle s'unisse à vous, bien que vous ayez peut-être commis une erreur, le Dieu qui est capable de changer les erreurs en bien, s'est joint à vous et à cette femme méchante, car Il voit l'avenir. Il est un Dieu d'éternité. Il voit au-delà de vous vos enfants et les enfants de vos enfants. Il connaît l'influence que vous exercerez sur son monde, car il a tout fait pour lui-même. Ne touchez donc pas à ce mariage ; c'est absolument l'affaire de Dieu. C'est ce que le Seigneur dit ici, Matthieu 19 verset 7 à 8   « Ils lui dirent   Pourquoi Moïse a-t-il alors ordonné de donner un écrit de divorce, et de la répudier ? Il leur dit   Moïse, à cause de l'endurcissement de votre cœur, vous a permis de répudier vos femmes ; mais dès le commencement il n'en fut pas ainsi. Même quand Eve a commis le pire péché du monde (je l'appelle ainsi), en apportant la damnation à la race humaine, Adam ne l'a pas répudiée, car, \"----- dès le début il n'en était pas ainsi\" . Donc, il n'y a aucun péché que votre femme ou votre mari puisse commettre maintenant, quoi qu'il arrive, qui puisse impliquer le monde entier parce qu'il n'y a aucun homme ou femme qui peut commettre un péché qui apportera la même malédiction sur le monde qu'Eve. Pourtant, Adam ne l'a pas répudiée, il n'y a donc aucun péché que votre femme commettra qui devrait vous faire divorcer d'elle. Il n'y en a pas. Certaines personnes disent que \"l'adultère ou l'impudicité peuvent entraîner le divorce\". Jésus a dit quelque chose ici, et je paraphrase   « Quand vous parlez de Moïse, vous parlez de la loi. La loi a permis le divorce à cause de la dureté de vos cœurs, vous êtes des gens au cou raide et Dieu vous formait encore, mais maintenant moi, Jésus-Christ, je suis venu accomplir la loi et j'ai apporté la perfection, pour ramener les choses à leur niveau d'origine parce qu'il n'y aura pas d'autre dispensation, aucun autre sauveur ne vient, aucune autre autorité ne vient, et maintenant la parole de Dieu est venue mettre toutes choses en règle, et dans cette règle il n'y a aucune provision pour le divorce . qu'en est-il de l'adultère?', vous pouvez demander. Ils ont amené une femme surprise en adultère à Jésus et ont dit \"nous avons surpris cette femme en flagrant délit d'adultère et Moïse a dit que nous devrions lapider une telle personne à mort\". Jésus leur répondit et dit  \"Celui qui est sans péché parmi vous, qu'il lui jette d'abord une pierre\" '. Tout le monde s'est échappé - ivrognes, menteurs, voleurs, gens en colère, sorcières et sorciers ; tous se sont échappés. Que communiquait Jésus ? Jésus disait que l'adultère et les autres péchés sont les mêmes. Tout comme la colère ne peut pas provoquer le divorce, l'adultère ne le peut pas ; comme dire des mensonges ne peut causer le divorce, l'adultère ne le peut pas ; comme la sorcellerie ( c'est-à-dire une sorcière qui donne naissance à un enfant et le dévore) ne peut pas provoquer le divorce, l'adultère ne le peut pas. Vous ne pouvez pas divorcer de votre mari parce qu'il commet un adultère ou qu'il a épousé une seconde femme. Bien que ce soit un péché, cela ne peut pas causer le divorce parce que Jésus a ramené les choses à leur niveau d'origine. C'est lui qui les a créés depuis le début. Certains diront peut-être   « s'il en est ainsi, il vaut mieux ne pas se marier parce que le mariage est difficile et que les femmes sont gênantes ; si nous ne pouvons pas les changer comme nous le voulons, alors il vaut mieux ne pas se marier. A cela, Jésus a dit dans Matthieu 19 verset 11   \" Tous ne peuvent recevoir cette parole, sauf ceux à qui elle est donné.\" Tous les hommes ne le prendront pas. C'est pour les gens saints, qui sont dévoués à Dieu et à sa justice. Ce sont eux qui prendront cela; d'autres ne le peuvent pas. Romains 8 versets 7 à 8   « Car l'esprit charnel est inimitié contre Dieu ; car il n'est pas soumis à la loi de Dieu, et ne peut l'être non plus. Ainsi donc, ceux qui sont dans la chair ne peuvent plaire à Dieu » . L'homme charnel ne peut pas obéir à la loi de Dieu. Pourquoi? Il ne peut tout simplement pas, donc ce n'est pas pour tout le monde; ce n'est pas. Jésus l'a dit. Si vous échouez maintenant, Jésus a déjà dit que ce n'est pas pour tout le monde. Donc, cela signifie que si vous échouez dans cette affaire, vous échouez après l'homme ordinaire dans le monde, à la manière des hommes pécheurs dans le monde. Jésus l'a déjà dit, ce n'est pas tout le monde qui obéira à cette injonction, tout comme ce n'est pas tout le monde qui ira au ciel. Le choix vous appartient d'obéir à cela, ou de trouver une excuse pour le rejeter, le choix vous appartient. Vous pouvez dire   'Non ! Non! C'est mon avis'. Restez avec votre avis. D'autres personnes aussi ont leurs propres opinions, mais il n'y a qu'une seule opinion, car Jésus est le seul chemin.  **\nC'est Son opinion qui est la bonne, qui est l'Écriture. Je vous conseille donc d'obéir à l'Écriture et de vivre.  **\n \nSi vous le vérifiez d'Adam à Moïse, le mariage représentait clairement un homme et une femme. C'est l'union d'un homme et d'une femme, sans divorce, remariage ou polygamie. Regardez en arrière, Adam et Eve n'ont pas divorcé avant leur mort, vérifiez-le. Vérifiez encore une fois, quand une histoire a été racontée sur l'un des fils de Caïn qui a épousé une seconde femme, la Bible l'a mentionnée parce que ce n'était pas courant. Et cet homme était le meurtrier suivant après Caïn. C'était une sorte d'homme unique, têtu, pécheur ; une vraie singulière, qui pouvait épouser une seconde femme telle que la bible l'enregistre. Le mariage avec une seconde épouse n'était pas commun même parmi les pécheurs de l'ancien temps. Un homme, une femme était leur principe. Voyez Abraham; c'était une femme, un mari. Il était marié à Sarah, qui était stérile depuis dix ans, mais cela n'a pas altéré leur mariage. La stérilité n'a pas affecté le mariage entre Abraham et Sarah, même lorsqu'ils étaient incroyants, de sorte que leur mariage n'a pas été perturbé par la stérilité. Abraham ne s'est remarié qu'après la mort de Sarah. \nLe mariage de Jacob avec deux femmes était une manipulation. Ce n'était pas son plan ; il a été trompé. Il n'en était pas ainsi au début. Tout le monde était attaché à sa femme. Le mariage d'Isaac avec Rebecca, était de vingt ans dans la stérilité, mais il n'a pas épousé une autre femme. Non! Avec toutes les promesses de Dieu qui ont dit (paraphrasées), \"par toi je multiplierai la terre, j'accomplirai la promesse d'Abraham dans ta vie, ta descendance sera comme les étoiles du ciel et comme le sable au bord de la mer\", vingt ans de stérilité n'a pas poussé cet homme à travailler pour accomplir la promesse de Dieu par sa puissance. Il s'est dit   'Si Dieu a fait cette promesse, qu'il l'accomplisse'. Il a prié Dieu et c'est arrivé. Le remariage ou la polygamie n'étaient pas courants. Vérifiez-le aussi avec Joseph. Joseph en Égypte, épousa la fille de Potipherah , le prêtre d'On. Lorsque ses frères l'ont rejoint avec leurs femmes, il n'a pas changé de femme et a dit \"ok, laissez-moi maintenant épouser une femme de ma tribu\". Il était déjà marié à une femme. Votre tribu ou pas, ça doit être une femme. N'y introduisez même pas de tribu. Depuis le début, cela a été là. Vérifiez-le avec Moïse. Moïse s'est marié à Madian et sa femme ignorait complètement les coutumes, le mode de vie et les traditions du Juif lorsqu'elle a été amenée à le rejoindre. Moïse, un grand homme, n'aurait-il pas pu prendre une juive pour femme ? N'aurait-il pas pu dire   'Je veux une femme qui connaisse les coutumes de mon peuple ?' Moïse ne l'a pas fait. Même lorsque Miriam et Aaron se sont plaints, il n'a pas changé cette femme pour une autre.  **\nNous revenons au début. S'il vous plaît, allez prêcher cette vérité aux gens. Le Seigneur a décidé de nous utiliser pour récupérer l'église et c'est un message de récupération. Voir Matthieu 19 verset 8\n « Il leur dit   Moïse, à cause de l'endurcissement de votre cœur, vous a permis de répudier vos femmes, mais dès le commencement il n'en fut pas ainsi. » Jésus est venu et a dit \"retour au commencement\" et c'est là où nous en sommes maintenant. Allons le prêcher partout.  **\nLe Nouveau Testament montre clairement la restauration du mariage à l'état originel tel qu'il était au début, « une femme pour un homme ».  **\n1 Corinthiens 7 verset 1 à 3   **\n« Concernant les choses dont vous m'avez écrit, il est bon qu'un homme ne touche pas une femme. Néanmoins, pour éviter la fornication, que chaque homme ait sa propre femme, et que chaque femme ait sa\npropre mari.  **\nSi nous devions dire, que chaque homme se tienne aux côtés de sa propre femme et que chaque femme se tienne aux côtés de son propre mari, qu'attendez-vous de voir ? Un homme une femme. Vous ne verrez ni deux hommes debout à côté d'une femme ni deux femmes debout à côté d'un homme. Si nous devions trouver plus d'une femme aux côtés d'un homme, nous revenions vers elles et leur disions   « vous n'avez pas suivi cette instruction, que chacune de vous se tienne aux côtés de son mari ». Il doit y avoir une séparation entre ces deux femmes. Il faut aller chercher un autre homme. C'est ce que cela signifie; c'est l'Écriture. \"Que chaque homme ait sa propre femme et que chaque femme ait son propre mari\" . Le mariage avec deux femmes est en dehors de la volonté de Dieu. Ce sont des pécheurs qui font cela, parce que, \"Celui qui les a faits dès le commencement, les a faits homme et femme\" . Pas un mâle et deux femelles ou plusieurs femelles. Non! Il les a fait mâle et femelle et cela se tient jusqu'à aujourd'hui. C'est la norme dans le Nouveau Testament. Il n'y a pas de divorce ou de polygamie comme nous l'a dit la parole de Dieu. Obéissons à la parole de Dieu car l'obéissance apporte la bénédiction.  **\n \nLe péché de fornication et d'adultère dans le mariage   **\nMatthieu 19 verset 9  \t  ** \t   \n\"Et je vous le dis, quiconque répudie sa femme, si ce n'est pour fornication, et en épouse une autre, commet un adultère, et quiconque épouse une femme répudiée commet un adultère.\"    **\nJésus a dit que si quelqu'un répudie sa femme, si ce n'est pour fornication , il commet un adultère. Quiconque épouse cette femme, qui a été répudiée par son mari, commet également un adultère. La fornication est un péché commis par quelqu'un qui n'est pas/n'a jamais été marié, tandis que l'adultère est un péché commis par quelqu'un qui est marié.  **\n\nDeutéronome 22 verset 22   **\n« Si un homme est trouvé couché avec une femme mariée à un mari, ils mourront tous les deux, l'homme qui a couché avec la femme et la femme, ainsi tu ôteras le mal d'Israël.    **\nC'est l'adultère; un homme retrouvé couché avec une femme mariée. L'adultère a été commis et les deux doivent être tués afin que le mal soit éloigné d'Israël. Cela vous dit que, si un péché est commis dans l'Église et que le péché n'est pas correctement jugé, le mal est parmi vous dans cette Église. Jugez le péché correctement; c'est alors que l'affaire est conclue et que vous avez ôté le péché de cette Église. Si vous jouez avec le péché   peut-être que quelqu'un a commis un péché et que vous jouez avec lui ou elle, et que vous laissez tomber l'affaire, toute l'Église est souillée.  **\nDeutéronome 22 versets 23 à 24    **\n« Si une jeune fille vierge est fiancée à un mari, et qu'un homme la trouve dans la ville et couche avec elle ; Alors vous les ferez sortir tous les deux à la porte de cette ville, et vous les lapiderez avec des pierres, jusqu'à ce qu'ils meurent; la demoiselle, parce qu'elle ne pleurait pas, étant dans la ville; et l'homme, parce qu'il a humilié la femme de son prochain   ainsi tu ôteras le mal du milieu de toi. ”  **\n\nPouvez-vous voir, ils sont toujours dans une relation de fiançailles? Mais le lien entre elle et le mari avec qui elle est fiancée est très fort au point qu'ils l'appellent la femme de l'homme, mais ils sont toujours en relation de fiançailles. Donc, c'est la fornication dont parle la Bible, que \"si un homme répudie sa femme, sauf pour cause de fornication, vous étiez dans cette relation de fiançailles mais avant que vous ne vous réunissiez, quelqu'un a commis l'immoralité avec elle, cela s'appelle fornication parce-qu'elle n'est pas encore marié; c'est la seule exception acceptable pour la mettre à l'écart.  **\nDeutéronome 22 verset 25 à 27   **\n«Mais si un homme trouve une fiancée dans les champs, et que l'homme la force et couche avec elle, alors seul l'homme qui a couché avec elle mourra. Mais tu ne feras rien à la demoiselle; il n'y a dans la jeune fille aucun péché digne de mort, car comme lorsqu'un homme se lève contre son prochain et le tue , ainsi en est-il de cette affaire, car il l'a trouvée dans un champ, et la jeune fille fiancée a crié  \net il n'y avait personne pour la sauver.    **\nIl n'y a pas eu de consentement. Prenons un peu de connaissance à partir de là; Matthieu 1 verset 20\n\n« Joseph, fils de David, ne crains pas de prendre Marie, ta femme   »\nbien qu'elle soit enceinte, il n'y a pas en elle de péché d'immoralité, car ce qui est conçu en elle vient du Saint-Esprit. Mais pour la demoiselle (dans Deutéronome 22 verset 25 à 27), une union physique a eu lieu entre elle et un autre homme mais elle a pleuré et a appelé à l'aide et il n'y avait personne pour la sauver, alors l'homme l'a maîtrisée. C'est un vol à main armée; un viol. Elle n'a pas donné son consentement. L'homme l'a maîtrisée et elle n'a donc pas péché. Lorsqu'un homme et une femme sont fiancés et ne se sont pas encore réunis ( c'est-à -dire vivent ensemble et consomment sexuellement leur mariage) et que la femme est considérée comme un péché d'immoralité, c'est de la fornication, mais lorsqu'ils se sont réunis (c'est-à-dire mariés) et que la femme est vue en péché d'immoralité, alors ce n'est plus de la fornication, mais de l'adultère. C'est la fornication qui entraîne la dissolution de la relation de fiançailles, mais l'adultère, comme tout autre péché dans le mariage, ne provoque pas le divorce.    **\n \nChapitre trois   La position de la Bible sur le pardon et la séparation dans le mariage.  **\n \nLe pardon dans le mariage     **\nL'adultère ne sépare pas le mariage, car Jésus a dit qu'il est égal à tout autre péché. Au début, cela pouvait entraîner la mort complète de la femme. Mais maintenant, ce n'est plus le cas. Pourquoi? Tous les péchés sont les mêmes, ils emmènent les gens en enfer. Pourquoi l'adultère ne sépare-t-il pas le mariage ? Regardons\nMatthieu 18 versets 21 à 35    **\n« Alors Pierre vint vers lui, et dit   Seigneur, combien de fois mon frère péchera-t-il contre moi, et lui pardonnerai-je ? jusqu'à sept fois? Jésus lui dit   Je ne te le dis que sept fois ; mais, Jusqu'à soixante-dix fois sept. C'est pourquoi le royaume des cieux est semblable à un certain roi, qui tiendrait compte de ses serviteurs. Et quand il eut commencé à compter, on lui en amena un qui lui devait dix mille talents. Mais comme il n'avait pas à payer, son seigneur ordonna de le vendre, ainsi que sa femme, ses enfants, et tout ce qu'il possédait, et de payer. Le serviteur se prosterna donc et l'adora, disant   Seigneur, aie patience envers moi, et je te paierai tout. Alors le maître de ce serviteur fut ému de compassion, le lâcha et lui remit la dette. Mais le même serviteur sortit, et trouva un de ses compagnons de service , qui lui devait cent deniers. Il mit la main sur lui, et le prit à la gorge, en disant   Paye-moi ce que tu me dois . Et son compagnon de service tomba à ses pieds, et le pria, disant   Aie patience envers moi, et je te paierai tout. Et il n'a pas voulu, mais il est allé le jeter en prison, jusqu'à ce qu'il ait payé la dette. Lorsque ses compagnons de service virent ce qui s'était passé, ils furent très attristés et vinrent raconter à leur maître tout ce qui s'était passé. Alors son maître, après l'avoir appelé, lui dit   Ô méchant serviteur, je t'ai remis toute cette dette, parce que tu m'as désiré , n'aurais-tu pas dû aussi avoir pitié de ton compagnon de service , comme j'ai eu pitié de toi ? ? Et son seigneur se mit en colère , et le livra aux bourreaux, jusqu'à ce qu'il ait payé tout ce qui lui était dû. De même mon Père céleste vous fera de même, si de tout votre cœur vous ne pardonnez pas à chacun de son frère ses offenses .    **\nQue dit le Seigneur ? Le péché d'immoralité de votre conjoint, de votre mari ou de votre femme, contre vous, est très insignifiant par rapport à votre péché contre Dieu. Imaginez-le de cette façon; votre péché contre Dieu est aussi grand qu'un pays entier alors que le péché de votre mari/femme est comme un district dans ce pays. Si Dieu vous a pardonné tous vos péchés, quel péché votre mari ou votre femme a-t-il commis contre vous que vous ne pouvez pas pardonner ? Vous pouvez dire, 'c'est de l'adultère, de l'immoralité, comment puis-je pardonner ? Elle m'a embarrassé ». Connaissez-vous l'embarras que vous avez causé à Dieu en vous unissant à Satan, son ennemi, pour causer une grande méchanceté dans cette vie et pourtant Dieu vous a pardonné ? Quel embarras votre femme vous a-t-elle apporté que vous ne pouvez pas lui pardonner ? Quel embarras votre mari vous a-t-il apporté que vous ne pouvez pas lui pardonner ? Suffit-il de divorcer d'elle ou de divorcer de lui et de la jeter en prison ? Alors, le pardon que vous avez reçu de Dieu a été annulé.   **\nC'est ce que cela signifie; que vous n'êtes pas digne du pardon de Dieu. La Bible ne vous a-t-elle pas dit, « quand vous êtes debout en train de prier, pardonnez » ? « Si tu ne pardonnes pas aux autres leurs offenses, ton père ne te pardonnera pas non plus . » Maintenant que tu as refusé de pardonner le péché de ta femme ou de ton mari que tu appelles adultère, dont le Seigneur t'a dit qu'il n'est pas différent de tout autre péché et que tu as divorcé à cause de cela, ne pense plus au ciel, ton ciel est annulé. Le Seigneur a dit à ce serviteur \"Je t'ai pardonné dix mille talents et tu ne peux pas pardonner cent deniers?\" Naaman donna deux talents à Guéhazi et les lia à deux hommes ; vous dire le poids d'un talent. Juste deux talents avaient besoin de deux personnes, alors, combien de personnes porteraient dix mille talents ? Cela signifie que vous aurez besoin de dix mille personnes pour transporter dix mille talents. Et cela vous a été pardonné. Mais alors, pour ces cent sous qui ne rempliront pas votre poche, vous voulez tuer quelqu'un ; vous voulez divorcer d'une femme et la faire souffrir, dans ce monde où sont les démons. Vous envoyez votre femme dans l'obscurité de la nuit et vous dites   « elle a péché ». Vous avez abandonné cet homme à la méchanceté de cette vie et dites   « c'est parce qu'il a péché ». La Bible dit   « Pardonnez-vous les uns les autres comme Dieu pour le bien de Christ. l'amour t'a pardonné ». Et si le pardon est vraiment là, le divorce est annulé. C'est ce que la parole de Dieu nous dit. Prenez-le très au sérieux, manipulez-le bien et ne jouez pas avec. Pas de divorce; mariage est contraignant pour la vie .  **\nRomains 7 verset 2 à 3     **\n« Car la femme qui a un mari est liée par la loi à son mari tant qu'il vit ; mais si le mari est mort, elle est déliée de la loi de son mari. Ainsi donc, si, du vivant de son mari , elle est mariée à un autre homme, elle sera appelée adultère, mais si son mari est mort, elle est libre de cette loi ; de sorte qu'elle n'est pas adultère, bien qu'elle soit\nmarié à un autre homme.     **\nComme il lie la femme, il lie l'homme. Tant que votre femme est en vie, vous ne pouvez pas en épouser une autre. Elle peut être vivante mais malade ; elle peut être vivante mais une sorcière ; elle peut être vivante mais folle (folle); ou votre mari peut être vivant mais est le secrétaire d'une société occulte ; il est vivant mais est devenu tellement impuissant qu'il ne peut plus vous toucher. Quelle que soit l'histoire, si l'homme/la femme est toujours en vie, alors l'affaire est réglée, plus de mariage avec un autre homme ou une autre femme à côté de votre première femme ou mari. Vous pouvez dire, comment puis-je faire face, mon corps va brûler? Dieu qui a donné ce commandement vous accordera sa grâce. Le mariage est l'affaire de Dieu. Vous ne vous en mêlez pas. Il l'a fait et le parrainera. Suis-le. Il vous donnera la grâce. Ne sait-il pas, le Tout-Puissant ne sait-il pas, n'est-il pas juste et égal pour vous donner la grâce ? S'il y avait une coupure sur n'importe quelle partie de votre chair, le sang se précipiterait à travers cette coupure; les globules blancs, en même temps, se précipiteraient pour vous protéger et arrêter l'écoulement du sang ; c'est la grâce. Vous n'avez pas vu la grâce dans ce domaine parce que rien ne s'est produit. Chaque fois qu'il y a des troubles quelque part, c'est là que la police vient calmer la situation, mais quand vous ne voyez pas la police, c'est parce qu'il y a la paix dans le quartier. Par conséquent, s'il y a un problème de mariage, la grâce viendra. \"Là où le péché abonde, la grâce abonde beaucoup plus\" . Il n'y a donc aucune excuse, ô homme, à moins que tu ne veuilles volontairement obéir, car \"Tous les hommes ne peuvent recevez cette parole, sauf ceux à qui elle est donnée . (Matthieu 19 verset 11). Tout homme ne peut pas garder ce dicton; ce n'est qu'à eux qu'il est destiné. C'est la parole de Dieu que vous devez prendre au sérieux.  **\n \nSéparation dans le mariage     **\nLa séparation est autorisée là où elle devient vraiment nécessaire sinon elle est condamnable.\n1 Corinthiens 7 versets 10 à 11   **\n« Et aux mariés, je commande, mais pas à moi, mais au Seigneur, que la femme ne se sépare pas de son mari, mais et si elle s'en va, qu'elle reste célibataire, ou qu'elle se réconcilie avec son mari, et que le mari ne répudie pas sa femme ».  **\n\nRegardez attentivement cette Écriture. Cette écriture dit, à ceux qui se sont réellement mariés, qu'il n'y a aucune chance de divorcer, mais qu'il y a une fenêtre ouverte au moins pour l'air frais. Au cas où la situation deviendrait trop terrible au point que c'est l'avis de tout le monde autour et l'avis de l'église, alors il devrait y avoir une séparation, mais pas votre propre décision que vous allez partir. Non. C'est quand l'affaire devient terrible, peut-être que votre mari se conduit mal ou devient malade mental, vous menaçant avec un couteau comme pour poignarder, et les voisins commencent à vous conseiller de partir, c'est alors qu'il y a une fenêtre ouverte pour que vous partiez , afin que vous puissiez laisser l'affaire se calmer, puis vous pourrez retourner voir votre mari. C'est une question dans laquelle d'autres peuvent témoigner que la séparation peut être nécessaire, pas votre décision. Vous ne pouvez pas simplement prendre la décision de vous-même de dire   \"Je vais quitter ce mariage, ou je ne veux plus continuer dans ce mariage\". Le péché de cela est le suivant   chaque fois que votre mari commet un adultère avec une autre femme, vous partagez le péché à parts égales ( c'est-à-dire cinquante pour cent chacun). Donc vous ne pouvez pas faire votre christianisme n'importe où. Ils vous gardent des péchés dans la banque du péché, parce que le Seigneur a dit à votre mari que, pour éviter la fornication et l'adultère, chaque homme devrait avoir sa propre femme et que vous êtes sa femme, mais vous êtes juste parti tout seul. Vous irez tous les deux payer pour les péchés que l'homme épargne à la banque du péché après la mort. Ne dites pas que vous gardez votre corps, rappelez-vous que vous ne faites qu'un avec votre mari. L'autre partie de votre corps n'est pas conservée. Vous êtes un, donc vous ne vous précipitez pas et ne dites pas   « Je quitte cette maison » ou vous dites à votre femme   « Pars , va au village ou va rester à l'autre endroit ». Beaucoup pratiquent le christianisme qui ne les emmènera pas au paradis. L'homme est en Amérique, la femme est au Nigeria. Que cherchent-ils? Argent! Et ils sont occupés à commettre des péchés. \"O ouais, je me garde\", dites-vous, mais qu'en est-il de votre partenaire qui ne peut pas se garder. Il est toujours sur votre compte. Pourquoi êtes-vous trop négligent d'avoir élevé l'argent au-dessus de l'institution de Dieu ; que vous vous êtes séparés et dites que vous cherchez de l'argent ? S'il y a une raison de séparation, la Bible dit, 'que ce soit avec consentement et cela pour un temps et revenez rapidement ensemble'. Cela signifie qu'il ne devrait pas y avoir de long intervalle de peur que Satan ne vous tente pour votre incontinence.\nVous désobéissez à la parole de Dieu pour l'argent, l'éducation et pour d'autres questions de la vie. Regardez-le dans 1 Corinthiens 7 versets 4 à 5 \n« La femme n'a pas le pouvoir de son propre corps, mais le mari, et de même aussi le mari n'a pas le pouvoir de son propre corps, mais la femme. ne vous escroquez pas les uns les autres, si ce n'est avec un consentement pour un temps, afin que vous puissiez vous adonner au jeûne et à la prière ; (même pas chercher de l'argent) \"et réunissez-vous de nouveau, afin que Satan ne vous tente pas pour votre incontinence .\"  **\nCela prévoit-il que quelqu'un reste en Amérique pendant cinq ans ? Si pour une raison quelconque, bien sûr, vous souhaitez suivre un cours, cela doit cependant être « avec consentement ». Et c'est un moment délicat à cause de Satan. Et vous jouez avec la vie éternelle ? Vous pouvez dire, 'Dieu sait que je me garde'. Es-tu marié? Votre autre moi/partenaire peut être quelque part qui ne se garde pas et vous en êtes responsable. Soyez donc sage, soyez prudent si vous irez au ciel. À propos de la sainteté, la Bible dit   « Sans la sainteté, personne ne verra le Seigneur. L'implication est élevée, c'est pourquoi la Bible dit  \"Gardez votre cœur avec toute la diligence.\" \"Tu nous as commandé de garder ton précepte avec diligence.\" Soyez prudent, de sorte que vous ne partez pas. Ne laissez pas le mariage être la raison pour laquelle tout ce que vous faites sera vanité sur vanité.\n                        \n  \n \n \n \n \n\nChapitre quatre   Vue biblique sur les traditions dans le mariage.  **\n \nConsentement parental    **\nDans la vision biblique du mariage, nous voyons que les parents de la fille ou de la femme ont le pouvoir sur elle de la libérer pour le mariage ou de ne pas la libérer ; de la confier à un homme en particulier ou non. C'est l'autorité du père et Dieu ne la conteste pas parce qu'il (Dieu) la lui a donnée.  **\n1 Corinthiens 7 versets 36 à 38    **\n«Mais si quelqu'un pense qu'il se comporte mal envers sa vierge, si elle passe la fleur de son âge, et a besoin de l'exiger, qu'il fasse ce qu'il veut, il ne pèche pas , qu'ils se marient . Néanmoins celui qui se tient debout ferme dans son cœur, n'ayant aucune nécessité, mais ayant pouvoir sur sa propre volonté, et ayant ainsi décrété dans son cœur qu'il gardera sa vierge, fait bien. Ainsi donc celui qui la donne en mariage fait bien; mais celui qui ne la donne pas en mariage fait mieux.  **\nIl y a quelqu'un qui donne et l'autorité de cet homme ne doit pas être négligée. Vous voulez vous marier et vous n'avez pas affaire avec le parent de la dame ; ce n'est pas le mariage chrétien. Le père de cette femme a une volonté sur elle, de vous la donner ou non, et Dieu ne l'accuse pas, sauf s'il y a un mauvais dessein en lui, Dieu ne l'accuse pas de pécheur. C'est son droit, ne le jouez pas. Si vous jouez avec l'homme qui a le droit, alors vous avez volé sa fille ; vous n'êtes pas entré par la porte, \"--- Celui qui n'entre pas par la porte ---- mais monte par un autre chemin , celui-là est un voleur et un brigand .\" (Jean 10 verset 1). Vous avez volé cette femme parce que les parents n'étaient pas au courant ; le parent n'a pas donné son consentement, vous l'avez volée. Si vous dites   « J'ai vu la volonté de Dieu envers une femme » et que le Père de la femme dit   « Je ne te donne pas ma fille ; ma fille n'épousera pas un homme Igbo; ma fille n'épousera pas un homme Yoruba; ma fille ne se mariera pas hors de ce pays », et vous dites   « oubliez ce qu'il dit ». Ne l'oubliez pas. Apportez cette question à Dieu dans la prière, si telle est la volonté de Dieu, \" Le cœur du méchant est dans la main du Seigneur \", combien plus le cœur du juste et de l'homme commun, \" comme des fleuves d'eau Il tourne où il veut ». Apportez cela à Dieu et laissez-Le changer le cœur de cet homme. Si Dieu vous a promis cette femme, Il vous la donnera sûrement. Il ira travailler sur le cœur de son père. Dieu ne passera pas par la fenêtre. Si vous venez acheter quelque chose dans un magasin de provisions et que l'homme n'est pas là, Dieu montera-t-il par la fenêtre dans le magasin de provisions et vous dira-t-il   « Prends » ? Pas de Dieu. Il n'y a pas d'iniquité avec Dieu. Il ordonne à l'homme d'exercer sa volonté. Il fera appel à la volonté de cet homme ; priez simplement Dieu. Dans le cas où vous avez prié et prié et prié, et que l'homme n'a pas entendu ou changé, ce mariage n'est pas la volonté de Dieu. Abandonnez-le et avancez , c'est simple. Il a dit dans Jean 14 verset 14   « Si vous demandez toute chose en mon nom, je le ferai ». I Jean 5 versets 14 à 15 dit  «Et c'est la confiance que nous avons en lui, que, si nous demandons quelque chose selon sa volonté, il nous écoute, et si nous savons qu'il nous écoute, tout ce que nous demandons, nous sachez que nous avons les requêtes que nous lui avons demandées.     **\nGenèse 24 verset 49 à 51    **\n« Et maintenant, si vous traitez avec bonté et sincérité avec mon maître, dites-le-moi et sinon, dites-le-moi ; que je puisse tourner à droite ou à gauche. Alors Laban et Bethuel répondirent et dirent  La chose vient de l'Éternel, nous ne pouvons te dire ni mal ni bien. Voici, Rebecca est devant toi, prends-la, va, et laisse\nqu'elle soit la femme du fils de ton maître, comme l'Éternel l'a dit.     **\nAttendez-vous à cela de vos beaux-parents. Ce consentement, attendez-le ; essayez de l'avoir; attendre de l'avoir; attendez. Au cas où vous auriez déjà sauté par la fenêtre, revenez en arrière et faites la restitution et recevez le consentement parental, alors vous pouvez rester avec votre femme. Une fois que cela a été libéré sur vous, avec ou sans dot, vous vous êtes portés jusqu'à rester ensemble, le mariage a eu lieu et la dot peut être payée plus tard. Parfois, la dot n'est pas exigée. À partir du passage ci-dessus, la dot n'était pas requise. Donc, si le consentement a été donné, vous pouvez aller rester ensemble en tant que mari et femme, puis vous pouvez venir payer plus tard quand vous aurez de l'argent.  **\nNe dis pas   'Je n'ai pas payé ta dot, retourne chez ton père'. Le père l'a libérée ; elle vous a été remise, avec ou sans dot. Tout ce qu'il faut, c'est payer plus tard parce que vous l'avez épousée à crédit. C'est comme, vous avez acheté une voiture à crédit, elle devient la vôtre et vous l'utilisez et elle vieillit maintenant. S'il y a du bruit et que vous dites maintenant que vous voulez rendre la voiture, à qui la rendez-vous ? C'est le paiement de l'argent qui reste. Vous avez la femme et maintenant elle vieillit et a déjà donné naissance à des enfants et vous dites que vous voulez la rendre. À qui? C'est la parole de Dieu, dot ou pas, le consentement parental est vital.  **\nVérifiez votre mariage, y a-t-il un consentement parental, vous ont-ils vraiment libéré cette femme ? Maintenant tu peux rester. Peut-être que son père vous a même rendu visite, a prié avec vous et vous a béni dans la maison. Peut-être que vous vous êtes enfui avant, mais il vous a pardonné et a dit   « Je vous ai pardonné , je veux que ma fille vous épouse, restez ensemble et dès que vous êtes prêt pour le paiement de la dot, vous pouvez venir », l'affaire est terminée. Tout ce qu'il faut maintenant, c'est de l'argent. Si vous allez manquer le ciel, ce sera parce que vous êtes un emprunteur qui ne paie pas « car le méchant emprunte (une femme en l'occurrence) et ne paie pas ». Ce n'est pas que vous commettez l'adultère. Non!\nVous êtes un emprunteur qui ne rembourse pas. \"Ne dois rien à personne\". Vous êtes redevable à votre belle-famille, c'est ce que vous devez comprendre. S'il vous plaît, allez corriger ces autres personnes qui mélangent ça ici et là.  **\n \nPaiement de la dot    **\nLa dot peut être exigée pour votre femme par ses parents.  **\n \nGenèse 34 verset 8 à 12.  **\n« Et Hamor s'entretint avec eux, disant   L' âme de mon fils Sichem aspire à votre fille, je vous prie de la lui donner pour femme. Et mariez-vous avec nous, et donnez-nous vos filles, et prenez nos filles avec vous. Et vous habiterez avec nous, et le pays sera devant vous; habitez-y et faites-y du commerce, et faites-y des possessions. Et Sichem dit à son père et à ses frères   Laissez- moi trouver grâce à vos yeux, et ce que vous me direz, je le donnerai. Ne me demande jamais tant de dot et de don, et je te donnerai selon ce que tu me diras, mais donne-moi la demoiselle pour femme.  **\nDemandez aux parents ce qu'ils veulent que vous donniez. Laissez-les vous donner leur liste; laissez-les vous facturer. S'ils facturent un million de nairas, plaidez parce que c'est un marché ouvert. Vous plaidez et vous mendiez. Toi, femme, participe à la mendicité. Vous savez quelle personne attraper (influencer) parmi vos parents, n'est-ce pas ? Tu sais. Et s'ils vous demandaient de l'alcool, des cigarettes et n'importe laquelle de ces choses abominables condamnées par l'Écriture ?  **\nMatthieu 7 verset 11    **\n« Si donc, étant mauvais, vous savez donner de bonnes choses à vos enfants, combien plus votre Père qui est dans les cieux donnera-t-il de bonnes choses à ceux qui le lui demandent ?   **\nNotre Père, qui est aux cieux, ne donne de bonnes choses qu'à ceux qui le demandent. Dieu ne donne pas de serpent; Il ne donne pas de pierre. Vous ne pouvez donc pas donner quoi que ce soit qui soit corrompu   alcool, cigarette ou toute autre chose qui soit corrompue. Vous êtes des enfants de votre père céleste qui ne peuvent pas donner de serpent et ne peuvent pas donner de pierre. Vous leur direz que vous êtes des enfants de votre Père, et la femme les aurait déjà préparés en disant   « mon mari est un enfant de Dieu, il ne peut pas faire cela ». C'est pourquoi l'église doit surveiller ceux qui vont se marier, pour s'assurer que tout se passe bien. Sinon , Dieu ne sera pas heureux le jour du mariage et Il ne sera pas là, car si la fondation est hors de cours, quelle est l'espérance des justes ? Assurez-vous que les choses sont suivies dans la droiture et la sainteté. Il ne devrait y avoir aucune immoralité avant le mariage. Que le paiement de la dot et tout se fasse dans la justice et la sainteté. Dieu vous fera grâce. Aussi durs que soient les beaux-parents, ils finiront par s'incliner, si la femme est de Dieu pour votre vie; c'est tout . Jacob a payé la dot par le service.  **\n \nRassemblement public   **\nIl peut y avoir ou non un rassemblement public.\n \nGenèse 24 verset 56 à 67    **\n« Et il leur dit   Ne m'empêchez pas, car le Seigneur a fait prospérer ma voie ; renvoyez-moi pour que j'aille vers mon maître. Et ils dirent   Nous allons appeler la jeune fille, et consulter sa bouche. Et ils appelèrent Rébecca, et lui dirent   Veux- tu aller avec cet homme ? Et elle a dit, j'irai. Et ils renvoyèrent Rebecca, leur soeur, et sa nourrice, et le serviteur d'Abraham, et ses hommes. Et ils bénirent Rébecca, et lui dirent   Tu es notre sœur, sois la mère de milliers de millions, et laisse ta postérité posséder la porte de ceux qui les haïssent. Et Rebecca se leva, et ses demoiselles, et elles montèrent sur les chameaux, et suivirent l'homme, et le serviteur prit Rebecca, et s'en alla. Et Isaac vint du chemin du puits Lahai-roi ; car il demeurait dans le pays du sud. Et Isaac sortit pour méditer dans le champ le soir; et il leva les yeux, et vit, et voici, les chameaux arrivaient. Et Rebecca leva les yeux, et quand elle vit Isaac, elle fit descendre le chameau. Car elle avait dit au serviteur   Quel est cet homme qui marche dans les champs à notre rencontre ? Et la servante avait dit  C'est mon maître, c'est pourquoi elle prit un voile et se couvrit. Et le serviteur raconta à Isaac tout ce qu'il avait fait. Et Isaac la fit entrer dans la tente de Sara, sa mère, et prit Rebecca, et elle devint sa femme; et il l'aimait, et Isaac fut consolé après la mort de sa mère.  **\nLe serviteur d'Abraham alla prendre une femme pour Isaac, quand il arriva à la maison de Bethuel , ce ne furent que Bethuel et Laban qui s'occupèrent de lui et lui relâchèrent Rebecca; il n'y avait pas de rassemblement public. Lorsque le serviteur a amené Rebecca à Isaac, Isaac a emmené Rebecca dans la tente de sa mère et il y a eu un mariage et depuis lors, elle est devenue sa femme. Il n'y a pas eu de rassemblement public. Nous disons que le mariage n'est pas obligatoire lorsqu'un homme a rempli les conditions du mariage telles que   le consentement parental, la volonté de la dame est recherchée, et elle lui est remise, le mariage a eu lieu.\nCertaines personnes ont amené la femme à rester avec eux avant que ses parents ne le sachent, puis ils vont plus tard chez le parent pour s'installer. Si les parents les acceptent et disent   « OK, vous pouvez rester ensemble, nous avons maintenant donné notre consentement, nous vous avons accepté », c'est le mariage ; le mariage a eu lieu. Il a commencé par erreur, mais est maintenant rectifié. Encore une fois, quelqu'un peut ne pas avoir l'argent pour le mariage. Il peut simplement prendre sa femme et dire à l'homme de Dieu de venir prier pour eux immédiatement. Lorsque cela est fait, qu'il y ait des personnes ou non, le mariage a eu lieu parce que les conditions du mariage ont été remplies. Vous pouvez simplement demander à l'homme de Dieu de venir vous bénir et c'est ok. Nous disons cela parce qu'il y a des gens qui pensent que lorsqu'un homme n'épouse pas sa femme dans l'église, il ne peut pas être ancien dans l'église et il ne peut pas non plus être ministre. Ce n'est pas comme ça. Dieu est le Dieu d'Abraham, d'Isaac et de Jacob et Isaac n'a fait aucun mariage public. Que recherchent-ils, le consentement de Dieu ou la louange des hommes ? Nous ne disons pas cela pour décourager le mariage, nous disons cela parce que le mariage a été poussé à l'extrême ou à l'excès et décourage les gens que Dieu veut utiliser. C'est donc ce que Dieu veut que vous sachiez.  **                            \n                                \nChapitre cinq   La consommation du mariage    **\n \nGenèse 24 verset 64 à 67     **\n« Et Rebecca leva les yeux, et quand elle vit Isaac, elle fit descendre le chameau. Car elle avait dit au serviteur   Quel est cet homme qui marche dans les champs à notre rencontre ? Et la servante avait dit   C'est mon maître, c'est pourquoi elle prit un voile et se couvrit. Et le serviteur raconta à Isaac tout ce qu'il avait fait. Et Isaac la fit entrer dans la tente de Sara, sa mère, et prit Rebecca, et elle devint sa femme; et il l'aimait, et Isaac fut consolé après la mort de sa mère.       **           \nRegardez cette écriture; Isaac a eu Rebecca et a dû l'examiner; « Est-ce que j'accepte cette femme ? » Bien que tout sur le mariage ait été réglé avec ses parents et qu'ils l'aient libérée, le mariage n'a pas été formé parce qu'Isaac n'était pas là et qu'il restait encore un processus. Quel a été le processus ? Le processus était le suivant   Isaac l'a amenée dans la tente de sa mère, ils étaient dans une pièce, puis il l'a prise et elle est devenue sa femme - une seule chair. Il y avait connaissance l'un de l'autre; ils ont fait l'amour, ils ont eu des rapports sexuels et cela a tout complété, ce qui veut dire que jusqu'à ce moment, Isaac pouvait rejeter cette dame en disant   « tu as tout réglé avec ses parents mais je ne m'intéresse pas à elle ». Et en ne la touchant pas, il a dit non, et Isaac aurait été irréprochable jusqu'à ce moment. Mais pour le consommer, il l'emmena dans une chambre et ils couchèrent l'un avec l'autre. C'est ainsi que s'est faite la consommation du mariage. Maintenant, vous pouvez voir le rôle des rapports sexuels dans la consommation du mariage et dans la séparation du mariage. Pourquoi disons-nous cela ? C'est important parce qu'il y avait des gens qui se mariaient et faisaient tout dans l'église, et quand ils sont arrivés dans la pièce, la femme a découvert que l'homme était impuissant. La Bible dit \" néanmoins pour éviter la fornication, que chaque femme ait son propre mari \". Ce n'était pas alors un mariage, car l'homme n'avait rien pour empêcher la femme de fornication. Ce n'était pas une maladie qui est venue après le mariage, cela aurait été un danger dans le mariage. Tout comme après le mariage, l'homme aurait pu mourir, n'importe quelle maladie aurait pu arriver ou n'importe quoi aurait pu arriver, ce serait un problème dans le mariage. Mais dans le cas ci-dessus, ce qui aurait achevé le mariage, l'homme ne l'avait pas.   **\nJ'ai entendu l'histoire d'un homme de l'ouest du Nigeria qui s'est marié avec sa femme. Quand ils sont rentrés chez eux, il a découvert qu'ils étaient tous les deux (lui et sa femme) des hommes, avec des organes masculins. Puis tous les deux se regardèrent. Le marié fut surpris car le visage était le visage d'une femme, la voix était celle d'une femme, mais le corps était celui d'un homme tout comme la voix était la voix de Jacob, et le corps, celle d'Esaü. Dans ce cas, dites-vous maintenant que vous êtes marié ? Non! Vous ne vous êtes pas marié parce que la femme n'est pas correcte. Elle n'a pas la propriété d'une épouse. Mais ensuite, il y a quelque chose que nous devons savoir quand ce genre de chose se produit. Laisse le l'homme ou la femme poussent un cri à temps sinon le silence sera pris pour accord ou pour réponse. Il y a une période de temps pendant laquelle vous devez le montrer, sinon on considère que vous l'avez accepté, alors avancez, pas de séparation sur la base de votre acceptation. Si vous dites non, alors criez, faites-le nous savoir immédiatement .  **\n\nDeutéronome 22 verset 22 à 24   **\n« Si un homme est trouvé couché avec une femme mariée à un mari, ils mourront tous les deux, l'homme qui a couché avec la femme et la femme ; ainsi tu ôteras le mal d'Israël. (Ils sont tous les deux mariés, ils avaient le consentement afin qu'ils puissent être tués.) Si une demoiselle qui est vierge est fiancée à un mari, et qu'un homme la trouve dans la ville, et couche avec elle; Alors vous les ferez sortir tous les deux à la porte de cette ville, et vous les lapiderez avec des pierres, jusqu'à ce qu'ils meurent; la demoiselle, parce qu'elle n'a pas pleuré, étant dans la ville ;    **\nCela montre que vous êtes consentant, c'est pourquoi l'homme faisait toutes ces choses et vous ne pleuriez pas. Tu es restée silencieuse jusqu'à ce que tout soit terminé avant de dire que l'homme t'a forcée. Quelle est votre preuve? Alors témoignez à un le temps qu'on attend de vous, alors les gens sauront et témoigneront que vous avez raison, mais si vous restez et non bruit de n'importe où, ne revenez pas en disant \"la raison pour laquelle je n'ai pas pu continuer est que, en fait, c'est la cinquième année que je le porte\". La Bible dit   « bien-aimé, que la patience ait son œuvre parfaite dans votre vie, afin que vous soyez parfaits et entiers » Depuis que vous avez commencé la vie de patience \"ne voulant rien\"  et tu es resté jusqu'à cinq ans, j'espère, ce ne sera pas long. Vous savez cet enseignement donné ici, est sorti du raisonnement parce que Paul dit dans 1 Corinthiens 7 verset 12 \"Mais c'est moi, et non le Seigneur, qui dis aux autres  Si un frère a une femme qui ne croit pas, et qu'il lui plaise d'habiter avec lui, qu'il ne la répudie pas.\" Paul a dit que c'est moi qui l'ai dit. Je parle de la même manière, que c'est mon raisonnement qui m'a fait parler de ce sujet particulier parce que, si nous le sautons tous, la justice ne sera pas complète et beaucoup trébucheront et tomberont. Pour beaucoup de ceux qui ont épousé ce type de personnes et ne savaient pas quoi faire, sont finalement devenus des adultères car ils ne pouvaient pas se garder. Elles commettaient des péchés et les maris leur disaient peut-être « allez coucher avec n'importe qui et amenez-moi des enfants, couvrez-moi ». Et depuis qu'elle a une licence de son mari, elle va, et tous les deux vont en enfer . \"Mais vous connaîtrez la vérité et la vérité vous affranchira.\" Donc je parle par comprendre ce que le Seigneur m'a donné pour sauver une telle situation.  **\n \nChapitre Six   Position biblique sur le mariage avec un non-croyant et un croyant   **\n \nMariage avec un non-croyant    **\nSi vous avez un incroyant comme mari ou comme femme, comment vivez-vous ? Premier Pierre 3 verset 1 à 7    **\n« De même, femmes, soyez soumises à vos propres maris ; que, si quelqu'un n'obéit pas à la parole, il peut aussi, sans la parole, être gagné par la conversation des épouses ; Pendant qu'ils voient votre conversation chaste couplée à la peur. Dont la parure ne soit pas cette parure extérieure de tresser les cheveux, et de porter de l'or, ou de se vêtir ; Mais que ce soit l'homme caché du cœur, dans ce qui n'est pas corruptible, même l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille, qui est aux yeux de Dieu d'un grand prix. Car c'est ainsi qu'autrefois les saintes femmes, qui se confiaient en Dieu, se paraient elles-mêmes, étant soumises à leurs propres maris, comme Sara obéit à Abraham, l'appelant le seigneur dont vous êtes les filles, pourvu que vous fassiez bien, et ne craignent aucun étonnement. De même, vous les maris, demeurez avec eux selon la connaissance, donnant honneur à la femme, comme au vase le plus faible, et comme étant héritiers ensemble de la grâce de la vie ; afin que vos prières ne soient pas entravées.   **\nVous avez un mari qui est un incroyant, que dit l'Écriture ? Le La Bible vous ordonne de vous soumettre à lui, même dans sa vie de péché et de vivre une vie sainte devant lui. Soumettez-vous à votre mari même dans son état pécheur, en tant qu'incroyant. Une personne qui ne croit pas commet quel type de péchés ? L'adultère, l'ivresse, les combats, le mensonge, les abus, le non-pardon et même épouser une autre femme. Avec tout cela mis ensemble, le Seigneur dit toujours   « Soumettez-vous à lui » . Pourquoi es-tu si fière, que tu penses que parce que ton mari est marié à une seconde femme, tu dis   'jamais, je ne peux pas partager mon mari avec elle' ? Tu iras le partager avec elle en enfer. Dieu dit   « Soumettez-vous » . Le Seigneur sait qu'il est un pécheur et un pécheur peut tout faire. Et cela vous dit que ceux qui disent que l'immoralité peut causer le divorce mentent, parce que la Bible dit qu'un incroyant est un pécheur. Toi, l'épouse chrétienne, soumets-toi à lui. C'est un adultère, mais soumettez-vous. La Bible dit que si vous voulez qu'il soit sauvé ou qu'il naisse de nouveau, n'allez pas de manière masculine , sophistiquée et flamboyante dans l'habillement, la coiffure, la décoration de vous-même dans ceci ou cela. Non! Suivez la voie humble, tranquille, douce et sainte. Allez par là, vous pouvez le gagner ou bien, il peut tout faire contre vous, mais n'emmènera jamais votre âme en enfer. Vous garderez toujours votre âme dans ce mariage.  **\nIl en va de même pour un mari croyant dont la femme est incroyante. Certains d'entre vous voudraient la traîner. Vous sentez que vous avez plus de pouvoir qu'elle. Jésus n'a pas traîné les membres de sa famille qui ne croyaient pas en lui, car la Bible dit   « Ni Ses frères ont-ils cru en lui ? » . Ne la forcez pas, ne lui ordonnez pas, 'vous ne devez jamais porter de boucle d'oreille chez moi'. S'il vous plaît, traitez-la avec douceur. Si elle dit qu'elle ne l'enlèvera pas, laissez-la. Nous comprendrons avec vous parce que l'Écriture dit que vous devez rester avec elle, l'aimer, prendre soin d'elle ; de cette façon, vous pouvez la sauver ou elle peut rester en permanence avec le diable, mais votre vie sainte vous conduira au ciel. Elle ne devrait pas être la raison pour laquelle vous irez en enfer. Un des frères a vu une femme portant des boucles d'oreilles lors de notre réunion et a dit qu'il allait la rencontrer pour savoir comment elle était entrée dans notre réunion avec des boucles d'oreilles. Je lui ai dit qu'elle était peut-être la femme d'un de nos frères. de John Wesley femme était une femme terrible mais il l'aimait et s'occupait d'elle. Elle est morte dans ses péchés, bien sûr nous n'avons pas entendu dire qu'elle s'est repentie avant de mourir. Alors elle doit être en enfer maintenant mais John Wesley a maintenu sa sainteté et il est au paradis. C'est pourquoi vous ne devriez pas laisser l'incrédule être quelque chose pour vous, votre cœur devrait toujours l'aimer. C'est ce que la Bible nous dit dans   **\n1 Corinthiens 7 verset 12, \n\"Mais c'est moi, et non l'Éternel, qui dis aux autres que si un frère a une femme qui ne croit pas, et qu'il lui plaise d'habiter avec lui, qu'il ne la répudie pas.\" Une femme qui ne croit pas peut aussi commettre l'adultère. N'est-ce pas possible? Comment le Seigneur vous dira-t-il de répudier une femme pour adultère alors que la Bible dit « ne la répudiez pas » ? L'Écriture peut-elle se contredire?  **\n1 Corinthiens 7 versets 13 à 17    **\n« Et la femme qui a un mari qui ne croit pas, et s'il lui plaît d'habiter avec elle, qu'elle ne le quitte pas. Car le mari incroyant est sanctifié par la femme, et la femme incroyante est sanctifiée par le mari, sinon vos enfants seraient impurs ; mais maintenant ils sont saints. Mais si l'incroyant s'en va , qu'il s'en aille. Un frère ou une sœur n'est pas asservi dans de tels cas   mais Dieu nous a appelés à la paix. Car que sais -tu, femme, si tu sauveras ton mari ? ou comment sais -tu, ô homme, si tu sauveras ta femme ? Mais comme Dieu a distribué à chacun, comme le Seigneur a appelé chacun, qu'il marche ainsi. Et j'ordonne ainsi dans toutes les églises\"    **\nDieu est impliqué dans tout ce qui se passe entre vous et votre femme. Si elle part, cela devient un appel divin vous demandant d'être célibataire, \"car celui qui est célibataire se soucie des choses du Seigneur\". Si votre mari dit que vous devriez partir, cela devient l'appel de Dieu pour que vous soyez célibataire, \"car celle qui est célibataire se soucie des choses du Seigneur, mais celle qui est mariée se soucie des choses du monde, comment elle peut lui plaire\". mari.\" C'est un autre appel gracieux; vous ferez plus pour Jésus. Donc, ce que dit Paul, c'est que tu as une femme incroyante, elle va bien, elle porte ses boucles d'oreilles mais elle te cuisine, elle ne te refuse pas sur le lit, elle est si heureuse avec toi, satisfaite d'être avec toi, tu t'occupes de la maison, tu t'occupes des enfants, pourquoi alors dis-tu qu'elle doit partir parce qu'elle porte des boucles d'oreilles ? Laissez cette question, parce qu'elle n'est pas née de nouveau, laissez cette question. Qui sait si avec de la patience vous sauverez votre femme ? Certains d'entre eux finiront par renaître, alors laissez-la tranquille.\nDe même vous avez un mari qui ne croit pas mais il est toujours prêt à vivre avec vous, permettez-lui. Quand je suis allé en Italie , j'ai rencontré un homme blanc qui s'est marié avec une Africaine. Chaque fois qu'ils allaient à l'église, il accompagnait sa femme et servait de nounou à leur fils, un enfant d'environ un an. Il attendrait dehors jusqu'à ce que le service soit terminé. Une fois le service terminé, il ramènerait sa femme et son enfant à la maison pour continuer leur vie. Quand j'ai vu ce qui se passait, j'ai appelé l'homme et lui ai parlé de Jésus et quand il a dit qu'il était prêt à accepter le Seigneur, je l'ai conduit à Christ et me suis réjoui qu'il soit né de nouveau. Malheureusement, il n'est pas encore né de nouveau, car jusqu'à ce moment, quand j'ai appelé la femme, elle m'a dit que la même chose se passait toujours. C'est parce qu'ils sont venus ensemble à l'église, il était dehors que je lui ai prêché. Jusqu'à présent, il fait toujours le même métier ; venir à l'église, attendre sa famille quelque part jusqu'à ce que le service soit terminé, puis ils rentrent chez eux heureux. Femme, tu veux quitter ce type d'homme ? Laissez-le jusqu'à ce que Dieu le visite. Mais s'il refuse, permettez-lui, cela n'affectera pas votre vie chrétienne. Même si c'est le cas, Dieu vous a donné la victoire sur cela. Si vous vous en allez, ne savez-vous pas que votre présence là-bas donne à cet homme le privilège d'être sauvé ? Votre prière ne permet pas aux démons de venir à cet endroit. Les démons l'attendent dehors, très loin, mais chaque fois qu'il vient à la maison, les démons disent   « tu sais que ta femme est dans cette maison donc je ne viendrai pas avec toi ». Vous savez, petit à petit comme ça il peut y avoir grâce pour lui de renaître, c'est pourquoi il ne faut pas le quitter. Encore une fois qu'en est-il des enfants, vous voulez quitter l'homme, il pourrait vous arracher les enfants parce qu'ils sont ses enfants et il les emmènera au péché. Votre présence aide quelque chose pour ces enfants, alors ne faites rien de tel.  **\nMec, tu veux que ta femme aille parce qu'elle ne coopère pas ou qu'elle ne va pas à l'église ? Qui sait si vous la sauverez ? Être patient. Mais au cas où la femme déciderait de dire, elle partira, laissez-la faire comme elle veut. Qui sait le mal que cette femme te ferait demain ? Pensez-vous que vous auriez pu éventuellement la sauver ? Laissez-la partir. Ou l'homme peut décider de dire   « Je vais divorcer », laissez-le faire ce qu'il veut. Ne refusez pas car vous ne savez pas les dégâts que l'homme vous causerait demain. Pensez-vous que vous auriez pu éventuellement le sauver ? \nLaissez-le aller, \"Car toutes choses concourent au bien de ceux qui aiment Dieu, de ceux qui sont appelés selon son dessein\" . Cela peut devenir une grâce pour vous. « Mais comme Dieu a distribué à chacun, comme le Seigneur a appelé chacun, qu'il marche ainsi » (1 Corinthiens 7 verset 17). Si le Seigneur a accordé que vous n'ayez pas de mari, ou que vous restiez seule, allez et servez le Seigneur de cette manière ; c'est la grâce. Il y a beaucoup de femmes mariées aujourd'hui qui souhaitent ne pas être mariées, qu'elles auraient mieux servi Dieu. Il y a beaucoup d'hommes mariés aujourd'hui qui souhaiteraient ne pas être mariés, qu'ils auraient mieux servi Dieu. Paul a même dit \"Je voudrais que tous les hommes soient comme moi\". Ainsi, vous avez la possibilité d'être comme Paul, ne vous souciez pas de ces choses.  **\nMari, et si le Seigneur la ramenait d'ici demain ? Le fils prodigue reviendra un jour à la maison. Donc, vous ne devriez pas aller en épouser un autre. Non! Et si le fils prodigue revenait à la maison ? Vous aurez deux femmes. Femme, et si le fils prodigue revenait à la maison ? Que ferez-vous de votre mari, si vous en avez épousé un autre ? La Bible dit, restez célibataire s'il ou elle part.  **\n \nMariage avec un croyant     **\nEphésiens 5 versets 21 à 33    **\n« Soumettez-vous les uns aux autres dans la crainte de Dieu. Femmes, soyez soumises à vos propres maris, comme au Seigneur. Car le mari est le chef de la femme, comme Christ est le chef de l'Église, et il est le sauveur du corps. C'est pourquoi , comme l'Église est soumise à Christ, ainsi les femmes le sont en toutes choses à leurs maris. Maris, aimez vos femmes, comme Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle; Afin qu'il puisse la sanctifier et la purifier par le lavage d'eau par la parole, afin qu'il puisse se la présenter comme une église glorieuse, sans tache, ni ride, ni quoi que ce soit de semblable; mais qu'il soit saint et sans défaut. Ainsi les hommes doivent aimer leurs femmes comme leurs propres corps. Celui qui aime sa femme s'aime lui-même. Car personne n'a encore haï sa propre chair; mais le nourrit et le chérit , comme le Seigneur l'Église, car nous sommes membres de son corps, de sa chair et de ses os. C'est pourquoi l'homme quittera son père et sa mère, et s'attachera à sa femme, et les deux deviendront une seule chair. C'est un grand mystère , mais je parle de Christ et de l'église. Néanmoins, que chacun de vous en particulier aime tant sa femme comme lui-même ; et la femme voit qu'elle révère son mari . ”     **\nFemmes, révérez et honorez vos maris, et vous, maris, aimez vos femmes. Vous savez, quand Paul a commencé à écrire, le Saint-Esprit a commencé avec la femme, \"les femmes se soumettent à leur propre mari\". Il semble que si la soumission est faite, aimer devient facile. Si ces femmes qui montent et descendent se soumettent, elles apprécieront leur mariage. Cette soumission est pour vous-même. « L'homme miséricordieux fait du bien à son âme » (Proverbes 11 verset 17). \"La justice du juste sera sur lui\". (Ezéchiel 18 verset 20). La soumission que vous faites est pour vous-même. Si vous n'avez pas apprécié le mariage, allez et commencez à vous soumettre, vous constaterez que les choses vont simplement changer. Si un petit enfant court vers vous et veut jouer avec vous ; tu sais que c'est un petit enfant, que vas-tu faire pour pouvoir jouer avec l'enfant ? Vous allez vous baisser. Si tu veux que ton mari se baisse, tu descends dans la soumission, cet homme se pliera, il t'y rencontrera. Vous l'humilierez là-bas. Voyez comment vous jouez avec un enfant, avec amour, avec joie. Fais-toi comme ça, aimer. Jouez avec votre mari comme le ferait un enfant. Il va se calmer, se soumettre pleinement comme ça, il va se calmer. Soumettre en tout. Les maris aiment votre femme, c'est une lourde tâche, car vous êtes comparé au Christ, qui a aimé sans condition. Non pas que nous l'aimions le premier, mais qu'il nous a aimés le premier, \"Mais Dieu recommande son amour envers nous, en ce que, alors que nous étions encore des pécheurs, Christ est mort pour nous. « La femme a vraiment beaucoup de problèmes avec elle-même, mais comme le Christ aimerait sans condition, même jusqu'à se sacrifier, faites de même et vous finirez par avoir cette femme polie, sanctifiée et vous servant avec joie. Vous vous amuserez dans votre paradis sur terre. Si votre mari est incroyant, vous avez besoin de sagesse en tant qu'épouse ou si votre femme est incroyante, vous avez besoin de sagesse en tant que mari. Vous avez besoin de conseils, vous avez besoin de patience et vous avez besoin de prier. Je prie pour que Dieu fasse une nouvelle chose dans votre vie, une nouvelle chose dans votre mariage. Amen.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n",

      "body": "ÉLEVANT DES ENFANTS PIEUX POUR JÉSUS   **\nPRÉSENTATION   **\nCe livre est une étude approfondie sur l'éducation et la formation des enfants. Il se concentre sur le commandement et la sagesse de la Sainte Écriture sur l'éducation d'enfants pieux pour Dieu et la société. **\nLe livre est chargé des pouvoirs des Écritures qui obligeront les parents à prendre des mesures appropriées envers leurs enfants dans la crainte de Dieu.  **\n2 Timothée 3 verset 15 à 17   **\n15 Et que, dès ton enfance, tu connais les saintes lettres, qui peuvent te rendre sage à salut par la foi en Jésus-Christ.\n16 Toute Ecriture est inspirée de Dieu, et utile pour enseigner, pour convaincre, pour corriger, pour instruire dans la justice;\n17 Afin que l'homme de Dieu soit parfait, entièrement pourvu à toutes les bonnes œuvres.  **\nSuivez les conseils scripturaires fournis dans ce livre et faites-en votre manuel sur l'éducation et la formation des enfants, et vous aurez des témoignages à donner sur la conversion de Dieu et l'engagement envers la piété parmi vos enfants.  **\n Deutéronome 6 verset 6 à 7   **\n6 Et ces paroles, que je te commande aujourd'hui, seront dans ton cœur ;\n7 Et tu les enseigneras assidûment à tes enfants, et tu en parleras quand tu seras assis dans ta maison, quand tu iras en voyage, quand tu te coucheras et quand tu te lèveras .  **\nCe livre vous montre pourquoi les enfants se comportent comme ils le font et comment vaincre les pouvoirs des forces qui gâtent les enfants. Il encourage ceux du monde occidental à ne pas se soumettre aux lois corrompues du gouvernement qui sont contraires aux lois éternelles de Dieu sur l'éducation et la formation des enfants. L'Écriture exhorte fortement les parents à appliquer une discipline appropriée à leurs enfants égarés. Ne pas le faire, c'est les gâcher.  **\n\nProverbes 22 verset 15   **\nLa folie est liée au cœur d'un enfant; mais la verge de la correction l'éloignera de lui.  **\nProverbes 23 verset 14   **\n\"Tu le frapperas avec la verge, et tu délivreras son âme de l'enfer.\"  **\nLes parents doivent apprendre à demander l'aide de Dieu dans leur devoir d'élever et de former leurs enfants. Vraiment, certains enfants sont extrêmement têtus, mais il y a de l'espoir pour eux en Christ. Invitez Jésus-Christ dans votre famille pour vous aider à élever vos enfants pour lui   le Seigneur a besoin d'eux dans sa vigne pour son exploit évangélique de la fin des temps. S'il vous plaît, élevez des enfants pieux pour Jésus !  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 1   **\nDIEU EST LE DONNEUR DES ENFANTS   **\n1.1 Chaque enfant donné par Dieu a un but à accomplir dans sa volonté   **\nGenèse 33 verset 5   **\n« Et il leva les yeux, et vit les femmes et les enfants ; et dit  Qui sont ceux qui sont avec toi? Et il dit   Les enfants que Dieu a gracieusement donnés à ton serviteur.  **\nDieu est le donneur d'enfants. Il les donne par sa propre grâce à l'humanité. Les enfants sont de petits êtres humains ignorants et innocents, hommes et femmes, conçus et amenés dans ce monde de péché et de Satan, afin d'accomplir la volonté de Dieu leur Créateur. Dieu les a donnés dans un but, pour accomplir Sa volonté. C'est pourquoi vous ne devriez pas regarder en commun l'enfant que Dieu vous a donné. Il vous est donné par la grâce de Dieu, pour accomplir la volonté de Dieu.  **\n Apocalypse 4 verset 11   **\n« Tu es digne, ô Seigneur, de recevoir gloire, honneur et puissance, car tu as créé toutes choses, et c'est pour ton plaisir qu'elles sont et ont été créées. \"  **\n\nEsaïe 43 verset 7   **\n«Même quiconque est appelé de mon nom, car je l'ai créé pour ma gloire, je l'ai formé; oui, je l'ai fait.  **\n1.2 Les enfants non formés sont des outils entre les mains de Satan pour les mauvaises œuvres.  **\nLorsque les enfants sont laissés seuls sans formation pieuse, sans le salut qui est en Christ, ils développent naturellement des cœurs mauvais et méchants et vivent dans la société comme des hommes et des femmes méchants ; hommes et femmes désobéissants; complètement ignorant de Dieu. Si rien n'est fait à l'enfant que Dieu vous a donné; si l'enfant est laissé seul sans entraînement à la piété; cet enfant sera corrompu. Si vous faites cuire votre nourriture ou votre soupe et que vous la laissez sans soins appropriés, elle se corrompra avec le temps, car l'atmosphère a un pouvoir de corruption qui corrompt tout ce qui y est exposé de manière inappropriée. De même, la force du mal dans le monde fait que les enfants s'éloignent naturellement de la moralité. La puissance du péché qui est chez les enfants les fait se détourner de Dieu à mesure qu'ils grandissent. Jésus a appelé certaines personnes enfants de Satan à cause de leur caractère et de leur haine de Dieu.  **\nJean 8 verset 44   **\n« Vous êtes de votre père le diable, et vous ferez les désirs de votre père. Il était un meurtrier dès le commencement, et ne demeurait pas dans la vérité, car il n'y a pas de vérité en lui. Quand il prononce un mensonge, il parle du sien, car il est menteur et en est le père.  **\nLa Bible s'adressait à certaines personnes comme, Enfants de Bélial, enfants de Satan.  **\nDeutéronome 13 verset 13   **\n\"Certains hommes, les enfants de Bélial, sont sortis du milieu de vous, et ont retiré les habitants de leur ville, en disant   Allons et servons d'autres dieux que vous n'avez pas connus.\"  **\nJuges 20 verset 13   **\n« Maintenant donc, délivre-nous les hommes, les enfants de Bélial, qui sont à Guibea, afin que nous les fassions mourir et que nous ôtions le mal d'Israël. Mais les enfants de Benjamin n'ont pas écouté la voix de leurs frères les enfants d'Israël. \"  **\nDeuxième Samuel 2 verset 12   **\n« Or les fils d'Eli étaient fils de Bélial ; ils ne connaissaient pas l'Éternel.  **\nCes personnes traitées comme des enfants de Satan étaient des enfants que Dieu a gracieusement donnés à leurs parents, mais n'ont pas reçu de formation pieuse. Ils étaient laissés à eux-mêmes.  **\n1.3 Votre insouciance est responsable de la bêtise de votre enfant   **\nLe roi Salomon passa près de la vigne d'un homme sans intelligence et quand il regarda ; il vit que les murs de la vigne avaient été abattus. Les murs qui empêchaient les animaux d'entrer avaient été démolis car il n'y avait aucune réparation, aucun entretien. Il a vu que la vigne était envahie par les mauvaises herbes. Le mauvais état de ce vignoble est dû au fait que le vignoble a été abandonné par le propriétaire. En la regardant, il sut qui était le propriétaire de la vigne   un paresseux, qui aimait le sommeil, les loisirs, les plaisirs et ne voulait pas se fatiguer. Sa vigne lui a apporté honte et reproche.  **\n Proverbes 24 verset 30 à 33   **\n30 Je suis passé près du champ du paresseux, et de la vigne de l'homme dépourvu de sens;\n31 Et voici, tout était recouvert d'épines, et les orties en avaient couvert la face, et sa muraille de pierre était renversée.\n32 Alors j'ai vu, et j'ai bien considéré, je l'ai regardé, et j'ai reçu des instructions. 33 Encore un peu de sommeil, un peu de sommeil, un peu de jointure des mains pour dormir.  **\nDe la même manière, la Bible dit     **\n Proverbes 17 verset 21   **\n\"Celui qui engendre un sot le fait à sa douleur, et le père d'un sot n'a pas de joie. \"  **\nSi votre enfant est un enfant insensé ou un enfant capricieux, vous n'aurez aucun plaisir en lui. Vous serez dans la peine. Mais alors, qu'est-ce qui a fait que l'enfant était un imbécile ? Vous étiez responsable ! Vous ne vous souciez pas de cet enfant qui vous a été gracieusement donné.  **\nProverbes 17 verset 25.  **\n\"Un fils insensé est un chagrin pour son père, et une amertume pour celle qui l'a enfanté.\"  **\nUn enfant têtu, un enfant méchant et désobéissant, causant des troubles dans la maison et dans la société est un chagrin pour le père. Il provoque l'amertume du cœur de sa mère. Beaucoup de parents aujourd'hui sont dans la peine à cause de leurs enfants. L'ennemi sévit beaucoup dans les familles et les mariages dans cette région. De nombreux parents souhaitaient ne pas avoir d'enfants, à cause de la vie de leurs enfants. Ils sont toujours honteux. La mère entrera dans la pièce et pleurera, alors que les gens la rencontreront et diront   « Alors cet enfant têtu est ton fils ? Prends soin de ton fils !\" La mère est dans la honte, elle est dans l'amertume. À cause des activités de Satan qui ont considérablement augmenté ces derniers jours, les familles, les parents et la société passent leur temps dans le chagrin. Même les frères et sœurs, les enfants du même père et de la même mère se lamentent à cause du comportement de la fratrie. Venez pleurer avec cet homme du livre des Lamentations.  **\nLamentations 1 verset 16   **\n« Pour ces choses je pleure ; mon œil, mon œil coule d'eau, parce que le consolateur qui devrait soulager mon âme est loin de moi, mes enfants sont désolés, parce que l'ennemi a vaincu.  **\n« Mes enfants sont devenus inutiles. J'ai donné naissance à des enfants, mais ils sont devenus autre chose. Ils devinrent des scorpions et des serpents. Mon ennemi l'a emporté. Satan a imposé ses mains sur mes enfants. Mes yeux se remplissent d'eau. Je pleure, je pleure ».\nQue dit-on du parent seul ? une mère qui n'a pas de mari pour l'aider à s'occuper de ces enfants ? Ou la veuve qui n'a pas de père pour l'aider à s'occuper de ces enfants ? Les enfants opprimeraient leur mère ! Ils méprisent leur mère ! Elle se lamente   « L'ennemi a prévalu. Les enfants ne m'entendent pas, pour cela je pleure et je pleure.  **\nLamentations 2 verset 11   **\nMes yeux se vident de larmes, mes entrailles sont troublées, mon foie est répandu sur la terre, pour la destruction de la fille de mon peuple ; parce que les enfants et les nourrissons se pâment dans les rues de la ville.  **\nC'est un observateur qui a regardé dans les rues et a vu des enfants capricieux. Il a vu des enfants corrompus dans les rues dans leur mauvais caractère, leur méchanceté, leur mauvais habillement et leur nudité. Il a dit   « J'ai pleuré, des larmes coulaient de mes yeux. J'ai crié ma force, car les enfants et les nourrissons se sont évanouis dans les rues de la ville. Vous pouvez maintenant voir la situation   des enfants têtus, des enfants méchants, des enfants capricieux, des enfants désobéissants, des enfants impies luttant contre Dieu et la justice. Alors que le peuple de Dieu se rassemble, il s'y rend avec des pouvoirs occultes pour le perturber. Votre enfant n'est-il pas parmi ceux qui perturbent l'œuvre de Dieu ? Ils ont rejoint l'armée de Satan. Votre fils vous cherche même à tuer. C'est une chose douloureuse. Satan est derrière cette affaire.  ** \nJean 10 verset 10   **\nLe voleur ne vient que pour voler, tuer et détruire.  **\nFemme de Dieu, homme de Dieu, comment ton fils est-il tombé entre les mains de voleurs ? Comment votre fille est-elle tombée entre les mains de voleurs ? Ils les entraînent à voler, et eux-mêmes entraînent les autres à faire le mal. Ils fument de la marijuana; ils se droguent, ils ont l'air idiots et stupides dans la rue. Je prie pour que Dieu essuie vos larmes. Que le Seigneur mette fin à cette honte. Je prie pour que les autres enfants auxquels vous prêtez attention ne soient pas corrompus entre vos mains au nom de Jésus . Amen.  **\n1.4 L' esprit de la fin des temps fait des ravages sur les enfants non formés   **\nLa situation est pire en cette fin des temps.  **\nDeuxième Timothée 3 verset 1 à 5.  **\n1 Sachez aussi que, dans les derniers jours, des temps périlleux viendront.\n2 Car les hommes seront amoureux d'eux-mêmes, cupides, vantards, orgueilleux, blasphémateurs, désobéissants à leurs parents, ingrats, impies,\n3 Sans affection naturelle, briseurs de trêve, faux accusateurs, incontinents, farouches, méprisants des bons,\n4 Traîtres, capiteux, orgueilleux , amants des plaisirs plus qu'amants de Dieu ; 5 Ayant une forme de piété, mais en reniant la puissance , détournez-vous d'eux.  **\nEnfants désobéissants ! Aucun respect pour les parents ! Votre fille est prête à vous combattre, à vous renverser et à s'asseoir dessus en vous parlant grossièrement   « Ne me parle plus comme ça. Promets-moi maintenant sinon je pars de chez moi. C'est aussi mauvais que ça. Votre fils est prêt à vous combattre. Il l'a appris du monde méchant. Ils lui ont appris à le faire, alors il ne peut plus vous écouter. Il ne peut plus laver vos vêtements. Il ne peut plus l'envoyer faire des courses. Il ne peut se joindre à vous pour faire quelque travail que ce soit. On ne peut pas lui dire quand dormir ou quand se réveiller. Il ne veut pas aller à l'école et vous ne pouvez pas le contraindre. S'il va à l'école, il y fait ce qu'il veut.\nLes derniers jours! Avoir une forme de piété, mais en nier la puissance. Ceux qui viennent à l'église n'ont pas de christianisme dans leur vie. Ne jouent-ils pas dans la chorale et commettent-ils encore l'immoralité et l'inceste ? Ils chantent dans la chorale. Sont-ils originaux ? Il y a un Dieu qui voit. Il y a un Dieu qui veille. Ils font beaucoup de choses mauvaises qu'on dira   « Ah ! Ah ! N'êtes-vous pas celui qui est dans la chorale ? Mais pourquoi es-tu comme ça ? L'ennemi a fait cela. Les derniers jours!  **\n\nChapitre 2   **\nSOURCES DE CORRUPTION CHEZ LES ENFANTS ET JEUNES   **\nQuelles sont les choses qui ont affecté la vie des jeunes et des enfants ? **\n2.1 Pression du groupe de pairs   **\n1 Corinthiens 15 verset 33\nNe vous y trompez pas, les mauvaises communications corrompent les bonnes manières.  **\nProverbes 13 verset 20   **\nCelui qui marche avec les sages sera sage, mais le compagnon des insensés sera détruit.  **\nParce que votre enfant doit avoir des amis, les amis s'apprennent le mal. Votre fille appartient à un groupe de pairs et est influencée par des amis. Comment peut-elle encore garder sa virginité, alors que son amie de 14 ans lui dit   « Pourquoi la gardes-tu ? Vous êtes une honte pour la société. Vous n'êtes pas encore une femme. Comment peut-on se vanter d'être vierge à 15 ans ? Tu n'es pas encore une femme !\" Et ils commencent à se moquer d'elle ! Son amie suggère alors   « Je vais vous fournir un homme. Enlevez-nous cette honte. Vous n'avez pas vu la douceur de vivre. C'est la pression sur l'enfant innocent. C'est la pression des pairs !\nAu jeune homme qui n'a jamais couché avec une femme, les amis disent   « Quoi ! Alors tu n'es pas un homme. Viens, je vais te montrer comment faire. C'est ce qui se passe. Groupe de pairs ! Les garçons et les filles qui n'ont pas de parents, qui n'ont pas de parents pieux, qui ont été abandonnés à eux-mêmes et qui font honte à la société et à leurs parents, sont maintenant les meilleurs amis de vos enfants. Ce sont eux qui leur enseignent la méchanceté et les entraînent à faire le mal. Ils leur enseignent comment commettre l'immoralité et comment voler. Groupe de pairs ! Amnon avait un ami, Jonadab était son nom, un garçon maléfique très intelligent. Jonadab, l'ami, a appris à Amnon comment commettre l'immoralité avec sa sœur. Il a dit  «Je vais vous donner la formule, très bon marché. Vous avez l'air stupide. D'accord, va t'allonger et dis à ton père que tu es malade et dis aussi que seule ta sœur Tamar peut préparer le type de repas qui te donnera du goût. Cela incitera votre père à venir à vous. Votre père acceptera votre demande. Alors tu peux l'avoir. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!\" Il l'a touché et a dit  \"Garçon.\" Et c'est ainsi que ce garçon est parti et est finalement mort.  **\n\nDeuxième Samuel 13 verset 3 à 14, 28 à 29.  **\n3 Mais Amnon avait un ami, dont le nom était Jonadab, fils du frère de Shimeah David, et Jonadab était un homme très subtil .\n4 Et il lui dit   Pourquoi , étant fils du roi, maigris-tu de jour en jour ? ne me le diras-tu pas ? Et Amnon lui dit   J'aime Tamar, la soeur de mon frère Absalom.\n5 Et Jonadab lui dit   Couche -toi sur ton lit, et fais-toi malade et quand ton père viendra te voir, dis-lui   Je te prie, laisse ma sœur Tamar venir, et me donner de la viande, et préparer la viande. à mes yeux, afin que je le voie et que je le mange de sa main.\n6 Alors Amnon se coucha et se rendit malade ; et quand le roi fut venu le voir, Amnon dit au roi  Je te prie, laisse Tamar ma soeur venir, et me faire deux gâteaux devant moi, que je puisse manger dans sa main.\n7 Alors David envoya chez lui vers Tamar, disant   Va maintenant dans la maison de ton frère Amnon, et prépare-lui de la viande.\n8 Alors Tamar se rendit dans la maison de son frère Amnon ; et il fut couché. Et elle prit de la farine, et la pétrit, et fit des gâteaux à ses yeux, et fit cuire les gâteaux.\n9 Et elle prit une casserole, et les versa devant lui ; mais il a refusé de manger. Et Amnon dit   Faites sortir tous les hommes de moi. Et ils sortirent chacun de lui.\n10Et Amnon dit à Tamar  Amène la viande dans la chambre, que je mange de ta main. Et Tamar prit les gâteaux qu'elle avait faits, et les apporta dans la chambre à Amnon, son frère.\n11 Et quand elle les lui eut amenés à manger, il la saisit et lui dit   Viens coucher avec moi, ma sœur.\n12 Et elle lui répondit   Non, mon frère, ne me force pas ; car rien de tel ne doit se faire en Israël, ne fais pas cette folie.\n13Et moi, où irai-je ma honte? et toi, tu seras comme l'un des insensés d'Israël. Maintenant donc, je te prie, parle au roi ; car il ne me retiendra pas de toi.\n14 Cependant il n'écoutait pas sa voix; mais, étant plus fort qu'elle, la força et coucha avec elle.\n28 Or Absalom avait donné cet ordre à ses serviteurs, en disant   Observez maintenant quand le cœur d'Amnon s'égayera de vin, et quand je vous dirai   Frappez Amnon ; alors tue-le, n'aie pas peur, ne te l'ai-je pas commandé ? sois courageux et sois vaillant.\n29 Et les serviteurs d'Absalom firent à Amnon comme Absalom l'avait commandé. Alors tous les fils du roi se levèrent, et chacun le prit sur sa mule, et s'enfuit.  **\nC'est la tension à laquelle votre enfant est confronté.  **\n2.2 Musique   **\nMusique! Le diable s'est emparé de la musique. La musique est la chose la plus attrayante pour la chair. Il fait danser les gens, chanter des mots grossiers et parler des argots. La musique de nos jours va de pair avec la pornographie. Les musiciens introduisent des femmes nues et de véritables actes d'immoralité dans la musique. Les gens qui chantent et dansent dans la musique contemporaine sont des stars. Votre enfant veut aussi être une star, alors il pense   « Je peux faire ce que fait ce garçon. Votre fille pense   « Je peux faire ce que fait cette fille. Je peux être comme elle. Ils entraînent votre fille à se tenir debout en sous-vêtements. Elle le regarde, alors la peur et la honte ne sont plus là. La honte est partie. Ils lui enseignent la prostitution directement dans la maison de son père à travers la musique et, bien sûr, ils se font un nom. Elle veut aussi se faire un nom. Ils les paient cher pour une telle nudité. Elle aussi a besoin d'argent. Elle a un ami qui lui a dit combien elle gagnait et a acheté une voiture avec. Musique et danse ! Une grande force contre les enfants !!  **\n2.3 Télévision   **\nLa télévision est devenue une nounou. Il a envahi la famille. Les parents disent à leur enfant   « Regarde et ne pleure pas. Regardez, ne vous inquiétez pas de manger de la nourriture. L'enfant ne se souciera vraiment pas de manger de la nourriture. En ces jours de travail, travail, travail ! Ils placent une télévision devant l'enfant et disent   « La voici. Voici vos stations préférées , allez-y, regardez, jusqu'à ce que je revienne. C'est une école que l'enfant traverse dans la maison. Il regarde et le monde et Satan sont prêts à le former. Lorsque vous revenez, il commence à dire   « Chu ! Chô ! Chu !\" Vous dites   « Que se passe-t-il ? Il l'a appris et le pratique !  **\nPsaume 101 verset 33   **\nJe ne mettrai rien de mal devant mes yeux, je hais l'oeuvre de ceux qui s'en détournent; ne s'attachera pas à moi.  **\nLorsque des enfants, un garçon et une fille qui sont frère et sœur, ont regardé de la pornographie, même si la scène est courte, ils voudront la pratiquer. Ils diront  \"L'homme a fait comme ceci et la femme a ouvert comme cela.\" Avant que vous ne le sachiez , ils feront comme ça et ouvriront comme ça dans votre maison. Cela s'est produit plusieurs fois auparavant et cela se produit toujours. J'ai entendu parler d'un garçon qui a tué un de ses frères environ, avec un couteau, après avoir regardé le Kungfu où ils utilisaient des couteaux pour se battre. Chu ! Chu ! Chu ! Alors il a porté un couteau et \"Chu\" sur son frère. Il est entré tout droit. Télévision! Quelle chose corrompue, amenant la méchanceté du monde dans votre maison, faisant de Satan le responsable de votre maison. Peut-être que vous les regardez aussi et que vous riez, cela s'enfonce en eux. Ils n'ont pas la maîtrise d'eux-mêmes comme vous.  **\nGalates 6 verset 7,8   **\n7 Ne vous y trompez pas; On ne se moque pas de Dieu, car tout ce qu'un homme sème, il le récoltera aussi.\n8 Car celui qui sème pour sa chair moissonnera de la chair la corruption; mais celui qui sème pour l'Esprit récoltera de l'Esprit la vie éternelle.  **\n 2.4 Films/Films   **\nDes films de crime, de sorcellerie et de pornographie sont disponibles sur le marché. Les enfants savent quand et comment aller les acheter et quand vous dormez, ils les regardent et apprennent la sorcellerie. Ils regardent \"Power Pass Power\". Ce que vos yeux voient, votre cœur le désire. Ils regardent des performances sexuelles en direct sous diverses formes. Comment peuvent-ils observer ces choses et ne pas être corrompus par elles ? Quand vous arrivez dans une maison où l'on prépare un bon repas, la bouche salive. La salive se forme d'elle-même. Le cœur commence à souhaiter le repas. C'est ainsi avec les enfants. Pendant qu'ils le regardent, leur corps est fortement agité. Beaucoup sont exposés à ces choses dès l'enfance. Dans environ cinq ans, nous aurons un monde terrible, à cause de ces choses qu'ils surveillent.  **\nDeuxième Pierre 2 verset 14   **\n14 Avoir les yeux pleins d'adultère, et qui ne peut cesser de pécher; séduire les âmes instables, un cœur qu'ils ont exercé avec des pratiques cupides; enfants maudits     **\n2.5 Internet   **\nLes enfants peuvent facilement accéder à Internet sur leur téléphone. Ils peuvent y accéder sur leurs ordinateurs. Ils vont sur les sites où le diable a arrangé de mauvaises choses. Satan a arrangé toutes ces choses pour les exposer à la méchanceté. Comment être initié à la sorcellerie est clairement là. Si vous voulez rejoindre illuminati c'est par là. L'enfant va innocemment sur ces sites et avant que vous ne vous en rendiez compte, il est initié. Vous dites   « Je ne suis pas une sorcière, mon mari n'est pas un sorcier, que vous est-il arrivé ? C'est Internet. C'est le monde dans lequel nous vivons maintenant. Oh! Beaucoup de parents ont les yeux qui coulent d'eau, leurs yeux coulent d'eau de honte et de chagrin à cause de leurs enfants. Plus que la honte et le chagrin des parents, c'est le jugement de l'enfer qui les attend.  **\nEsaïe 30 verset 9 à 11   **\n9 Que c'est un peuple rebelle, des enfants menteurs, des enfants qui n'écoutent pas la loi de l'Éternel ;\n10 Qui disent aux voyants   Ne voyez pas ; et aux prophètes   Ne nous prophétisez pas de bonnes choses, dites-nous des choses douces, prophétisez des tromperies ;\n11 Éloignez-vous du chemin, détournez-vous du chemin, faites cesser devant nous le Saint d'Israël.    **\n 2.6 Les Etablissements   **\nÉcoles! La corruption dans les écoles ! Les écoles sont livrées à l'immoralité   immoralité avec les enseignants pour passer des examens. Les étudiants commettent l'immoralité les uns avec les autres pour le plaisir. Les étudiants pratiquent librement la masturbation, le sexe oral, l'homosexualité, le lesbianisme, la pornographie et toutes sortes de relations sexuelles. L'environnement est libre et sûr. Seuls les déterminés peuvent échapper à la pollution dans les écoles. Les minijupes données aux étudiantes des écoles primaires et secondaires comme uniformes sont destinées à exposer leur nudité et à promouvoir l'immoralité dès le début, à leur insu.  **\n2.7 Restaurants/Panneaux d'affichage   **\nAllez au restaurant, Mr Biggs et certains de ces restaurants, vous y verrez de la pornographie. Nous sommes allés au bureau des télécommunications d'Etisalat, lorsque nous avons voulu obtenir une ligne mobile Etisalat. J'y ai vu de la pornographie exposée. J'ai demandé au préposé  \"Pourquoi gardez-vous cela?\" Il a dit   « Ce n'est pas moi. Il vient de notre siège social. Vous ne pouvez pas y toucher, ou le changer, si vous ne voulez pas perdre votre emploi. Le monde est déjà entièrement équipé pour enlever la dernière justice des hommes. Vous pouvez vous contrôler, mais l'enfant ne le peut pas. Nous devons apporter ces choses à Dieu et crier à Lui. Qu'en est-il des panneaux publicitaires ? Immoralité! Nudité! C'est ce qui est affiché sur la plupart d'entre eux sur le bord de la route et dans la ville.  **\n2.8 Le Gouvernement   **\nLe gouvernement dit   « Donnez des préservatifs à vos enfants et donnez-leur la liberté de les utiliser. Donnez-leur la liberté. Si vous ne leur donnez pas la liberté, nous nous occuperons de vous. Le gouvernement soutient la corruption des enfants. Satan a acheté le gouvernement. Ils permettent à la fois l'éducation sexuelle et l'éducation à la sorcellerie dans les écoles. Le sexe fait désormais partie des matières enseignées à l'école . Le monde combat Dieu. Le monde combat la justice. Le monde commence avec les enfants parce qu'ils savent que si vous voulez transplanter une culture, vous le faites quand elle est jeune. Quand il grandira, il ne montrera aucun signe de transplantation, il aura l'air normal. Ils les reçoivent donc assez jeunes. Certaines de ces nations enseignent la sorcellerie dans les écoles, pour éliminer ce qui reste de justice, afin qu'il n'y ait plus de justice dans ce monde dans lequel nous vivons. Dans certaines nations, le gouvernement a décrété que si vous battez votre enfant, vous aller en prison ou l'enfant vous sera enlevé et confié à une autre mère. Ils ont préparé des mères et construit des maisons pour accueillir les enfants. C'est ce qui se passe dans le monde occidental. Dans certains des pays où le gouvernement a déjà sanctionné ces lois, lorsque l'enfant arrive à l'école, les enseignants demandent   « Votre mère vous a-t-elle battu ? Votre père vous a-t-il touché ? Dis-moi.\" Si l'enfant répond   « Hier, ma mère m'a battu », la prochaine chose est que la police arrivera chez la mère parce que la mère a transgressé la règle du gouvernement. \"Votre enfant a rapporté à l'école que vous l'avez battu.\" Ils peuvent demander à l'enfant   « Qu'est-ce qu'on fait de ta mère maintenant ? Dites-nous ce que nous devons faire.  **\n Romains 1 verset 21, 22   **\n21 Parce que, lorsqu'ils ont connu Dieu, ils ne l'ont pas glorifié comme Dieu, et n'ont pas été reconnaissants; mais ils devinrent vains dans leurs imaginations, et leur cœur insensé s'obscurcit.  **\n22 Se déclarant sages, ils devinrent insensés.  **\nUn enfant était assis avec sa mère qui était partiellement sourde d'une oreille et parlait donc à haute voix. L'enfant a fait quelque chose et la mère lui a crié de la corriger. Peu de temps après , un policier frappa à la porte. C'est parce que les écoles ont donné aux enfants des numéros de police et leur ont dit   « Appelez-les n'importe quand ; si quelque chose vous menace à la maison   appelez simplement la police. Vous savez, un enfant aime mettre en pratique quelque chose qu'il a appris. Un policier est arrivé et a frappé à leur porte. La mère a ouvert la porte et a dit   « Oui ? Le policier a dit   « Je suis invité dans cette maison. La mère a dit   « Non ! Personne ne t'a invité dans cette maison. Le policier a demandé   « Qui sont les gens ici ? Elle a répondu  \"Seulement moi et ma fille de huit ans .\" Le policier a demandé à la fille   « Ma fille, m'as-tu invitée ici ? La fille a dit  \"Oui.\" Cela s'est passé en Amérique. La mère était choquée. Le policier a demandé à la fille   « Que s'est-il passé ? La fille a dit   « Ma mère m'a crié dessus ! « Pourquoi as-tu crié sur cette fille ? » Le policier a interrogé la femme et a ensuite dit  \"Ma fille, qu'est-ce qu'on lui fait?\" La jeune fille a dit   « Laissez-la partir et restez dans la cellule pendant deux semaines. C'est ainsi que la mère a été emmenée dans la cellule, afin qu'elle apprenne sa leçon. La police a averti la femme, après avoir terminé sa peine d'incarcération, \"Si vous essayez à nouveau, cet enfant vous sera enlevé, c'est une enfant américaine.\" C'est ainsi que vivent les parents. Ils les ont mis en servitude. Le diable utilise le gouvernement parce que l'iniquité doit s'emparer du monde. Êtes-vous toujours assis ? Ils creusent sous vous et ils vous feront bientôt tomber. Alors vous devez crier à Dieu pour votre salut et celui de vos enfants.  **\n2.9 Fausses églises et pasteurs   **\n2 Corinthiens 11 verset 13 à 15   **\n13 Car tels sont de faux apôtres, des ouvriers trompeurs, se transformant en apôtres de Christ.\n14 Et rien d'étonnant ; car Satan lui-même se transforme en ange de lumière.\n15 C'est pourquoi ce n'est pas grand-chose si ses ministres aussi sont transformés en ministres de justice ; dont la fin sera selon leurs oeuvres.  **\nIl y a des églises établies juste pour initier les gens à l'occultisme. C'est tout leur but. Les enseignants des enfants sont démoniaques. Ils se répartissent dans diverses églises, sous l'instruction   « Allez et montrez du zèle dans les églises. Montrez-leur que vous aimez les enfants. Ils sont là en mission, pour initier les enfants à la sorcellerie. Où votre enfant a-t-il été initié ? C'était dans l'église, par des professeurs d'enfants . Alors, où vas-tu maintenant ? Les voies de Satan sont si nombreuses que seul Dieu peut vous donner une échappatoire. Les filles peuvent être pointées du doigt par les enseignants masculins, les initiant assez tôt à l'immoralité. Les films projetés et le théâtre enseigné dans certaines églises incitent les enfants à pratiquer le mal.  **\n2.10 Pauvreté   **\nLa pauvreté aussi joue son propre rôle. Par manque d'argent, un homme et sa femme et environ cinq enfants, soit sept personnes, partagent tous une chambre. On a raconté l'histoire d'un enfant dont les parents ont utilisé un rideau pour séparer leur lit d'eux. Chaque fois que le lit faisait du bruit, il savait que quelque chose se passait du côté des parents. Alors l'enfant, un enfant intelligent, place un miroir directement au-dessus du lit de ses parents. Ainsi, lorsque les parents ont commencé à s'accoupler, il regardait ses parents dans le miroir en train de faire de la pornographie en direct. La pauvreté en est la cause. Les parents ne pouvaient pas se permettre deux ou trois chambres pour la famille. Mais la plupart du temps, cela est davantage dû à l'ignorance qu'à la pauvreté. Cela permet également à l'enfant de voir la nudité l'un de l'autre pendant qu'il dort, prend un bain et change de vêtements. L'inceste est fortement promu dans cette condition.  **\n2.11 Parents capricieux   **\nLa façon dont les parents s'habillent, les enfants suivent le style. Ils suivent l'habillage nu de leurs parents. Les vêtements que certains parents achètent pour leurs enfants sont terribles. Toutes ces minijupes que tu achètes pour tes enfants, tu te souviens que tu as des garçons ? Savez-vous que votre enfant de sexe féminin peut s'asseoir ou s'allonger en exposant son corps ? Et que votre garçon ne se souviendra pas qu'elle est sa sœur ? Certains parents contribuent à l'inceste dans la maison. Certaines mères exposent leur nudité à leurs enfants mâles à leur provocation sexuelle dans la maison. La salle de bain peut être mal couverte, exposant les femmes prenant leur bain à leurs frères et sœurs masculins. Cette condition maintient les enfants mâles chargés de sensations sexuelles.  **\n\njeunes\" du diable  **\nL'initiation multipliée est en cours. Beaucoup de gens veulent être riches, alors Satan leur dit le nombre de personnes qu'ils doivent initier pour gagner de l'argent.\nDes enfants multipliés sont initiés à la sorcellerie. Ce n'est plus à l'époque que votre père est un sorcier ou votre relation est une sorcière; vous ne serez peut-être jamais initié à la sorcellerie. Non! Ce n'est plus comme ça. « Oh Dieu du ciel, nous disons cela dans le chagrin et la douleur. Nous le disons en larmes. Seigneur, nous n'avons ni pouvoir ni puissance dans cette affaire. Si vous ne vous levez pas, que ferons-nous ? Si vous ne faites rien, (comme le roi de Samarie, quand quelqu'un lui a crié et a dit, O roi d'aide, et il a dit, Comment puis-je aider? Si Dieu ne vous aide pas? Comment puis-je vous aider, depuis le grange ou du grenier ? ») « Que feront les justes ? Les enfants sont initiés à la sorcellerie à la maison, à l'école et à l'église.  **\n Deuxième Chroniques 20 versets 11 à 13   **\n11 Voici, dis-je, comment ils nous récompensent, de venir nous chasser de ta possession que tu nous as donnée en héritage.\n12 Ô notre Dieu, ne les jugeras-tu pas ? car nous n'avons aucune force contre cette grande troupe qui vient contre nous; nous ne savons pas non plus quoi faire, mais nos yeux sont sur toi.\n13Et tout Juda se tint devant l'Eternel, avec leurs petits enfants, leurs femmes et leurs enfants.  **\nLes chrétiens traversent ce danger partout ; cherchez l'aide de Dieu ! Les parents traversent ce chagrin partout. Si Dieu n'intervient pas, où allons-nous ? Le monde devient de plus en plus fort dans le mal. Les choses empirent de plus en plus. Les enfants ont été égarés dès leur plus jeune âge. Certains sont initiés dès l'utérus. C'est une question de chagrin en effet. C'est un sujet d'inquiétude et le jeu se joue aussi dans la maison du pasteur, pour assouvir le ministère de l'homme de Dieu. Ils disent à l'enfant   « Amène ta mère. Nous te ferons roi, nous te ferons reine. Amenez votre père. Mon enfant, va mettre cette chose dans la nourriture de ta mère. Et ils les menacent aussi en disant   « Nous vous battrons si vous ne le faites pas. Nous allons vous tuer ! Alors l'enfant fait ces choses sous la menace.\nNotre Dieu renversera ces choses. Amen. Les parents sont mis dans diverses servitudes par les enfants. Certains parents sont mis dans la pauvreté parce que l'enfant est en alliance avec le diable pour vider la bourse de la famille. Certains souffrent   celui-ci est malade, celui-là est malade, l'autre est malade. Il n'y a pas de repos. Un enfant qui a fait perdre son travail à son père a déclaré   « Ils m'ont dit de faire cela pour que tu viennes t'asseoir à la maison. Alors toi et maman vous accuserez l'un de l'autre. Alors que vous pleurez dans la pauvreté, Satan rit et ils me font la promotion là-bas. Maman, c'est nous qui avons fermé ton ventre. Vous n'accoucherez plus. Je serai ton unique enfant. C'est assez par la force. Écoutez la parole de Dieu qui s'adresse à vous qui aimez le Seigneur Jésus      **\nEsaïe 41 verset 9 à 14   **\n9 Toi que j'ai pris des extrémités de la terre, et qui t'ai appelé d'entre ses chefs, et qui t'ai dit   Tu es mon serviteur ; Je t'ai choisi et je ne t'ai pas rejeté.\n10Ne crains rien; car je suis avec toi, ne sois pas effrayé ; car je suis ton Dieu, je te fortifierai; oui, je t'aiderai; oui, je te soutiendrai de la main droite de ma justice.\n11Voici, tous ceux qui étaient irrités contre toi seront confus et confus, ils seront comme rien; et ceux qui luttent avec toi périront. 12Tu les chercheras, et tu ne les trouveras pas, même ceux qui te disputaient; ceux qui te font la guerre seront comme rien, et comme une chose de rien .\n13Car moi, l'Eternel, ton Dieu, je tiendrai ta main droite, en te disant  Ne crains rien; Je vais t'aider.\n14Ne craignez rien, ver Jacob, et vous hommes d'Israel; Je t'aiderai, dit l'Éternel, et ton rédempteur, le Saint d'Israël.   **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 3   **\nCONDUISEZ VOS ENFANTS A JESUS POUR LEUR SALUT   **\nJean 14 verset 6   **\nJésus lui dit   Je suis le chemin, la vérité et la vie, nul ne vient au Père que par moi.   **\nEsaïe 48 verset 17 à 19   **\n17 Ainsi parle l'Éternel, ton Rédempteur, le Saint d'Israël; Je suis l'Éternel, ton Dieu, qui t'enseigne à profiter, qui te guide par le chemin que tu dois suivre.\n18 O que tu as écouté mes commandements ! alors ta paix avait été comme un fleuve, et ta justice comme les vagues de la mer;\n19 Ta semence aussi était comme le sable, et le rejeton de tes entrailles comme son gravier; son nom n'aurait pas dû être retranché ni détruit devant Moi.  **\n3.1 Suivez les instructions de Dieu et faites- les   **\nDivers fléaux sont infligés aux parents. Mais revenons aux instructions divines sur les enfants. Dieu qui est plus puissant que Satan nous a donné des instructions divines. Suis les. Ne soyez pas paresseux comme ce paresseux dont le roi Salomon a vu la vigne. Ne soyez pas paresseux comme lui. Lève-toi et fais ce travail autrement, ton espoir pour le paradis ne sera qu'un mirage. Levez-vous et formez vos enfants et écoutez ce que dit l'Écriture. Faites-le, ne respectez pas le décret contraire du Gouvernement de votre nation. Soyez sage, la voie du sage est en haut pour délivrer du mal en bas. Soyez sage et délivrez vos enfants. Qui vient vers vos enfants ? Qui enseigne à vos enfants ? Qui est en relation avec vos enfants ? Qui est l'ami de vos enfants ? Surveillez tout. Dieu vous aidera. Dieu qui ne veut pas que vous et vos enfants périssiez, se tiendra derrière vous. Il mettra son ange dans votre maison. Vous avez juste besoin d'obéir à Dieu.  **\n3.2 Conduisez vos enfants au Seigneur Jésus   **\nMatthieu 19 verset 13 à 15   **\n13 Alors on lui amena de petits enfants, pour qu'il leur impose les mains et prie, et les disciples les reprenaient.\n14 Mais Jésus dit   Laissez les petits enfants, et empêchez-les de venir à moi ; car à de tels est le royaume des cieux.\n15Et il leur imposa les mains, et s'en alla de là. Jésus a dit   « Amenez-moi ces enfants.  **\nConsacrez-les-Moi. Confiez-Moi ces enfants. Pourquoi les éloignez-vous de moi ? Amenez-les à l'église. Pourquoi pensez-vous que l'évangile n'est pas pour les enfants ? Ne vous occupez pas du bruit qu'ils font dans l'église. Les anges de Dieu sont là, prenant soin d'eux et les aidant à choisir un, deux ou trois mots dans ce que dit le prédicateur. Jésus dit   « Amenez-moi des enfants. Je veux leur imposer les mains. Je veux les utiliser. Je veux les bénir. Le royaume de Dieu est pour eux. Vous avez entendu le témoignage qu'un enfant d'environ six ans a été trouvé dans le feu de l'enfer. Une fille de huit ou neuf ans, elle a utilisé la sorcellerie pour tuer huit personnes. Dieu a dit   « Amenez-les-moi, je les délivrerai, je les sauverai du péché. Conduisez-les à Jésus. Demandez à Jésus de venir dans leur cœur. Laissez Jésus entrer dans leur vie et les changer. Il vous a dit de les lui apporter. C'est une instruction divine. Ne dites pas que mon mari est celui qui me gêne. Prenez l'enfant à part et conduisez-le à Jésus. Ne dites pas   « C'est ma femme qui le fait. Tu le fais! Le commandement est pour vous d'obéir. Peu importe combien de fois l'enfant a été conduit à Jésus ; continuez à le faire, jusqu'à ce que vous voyiez la preuve.  **\n3.3 Entraînez Votre Enfant   **\nProverbes 22 verset 6   **\nInstruisez un enfant dans la voie qu'il doit suivre, et quand il sera vieux, il ne s'en écartera pas.  **\nMontrez à l'enfant comment faire. Parlez-lui. Certains enfants peuvent être têtus, continuer à leur donner les mêmes consignes, sans se soucier de leur refus, de leur résistance, de leur oubli et de leur désobéissance pure et simple. Avec des prières, ils choisiront et se soumettront.  **\nEcclésiaste 11 verset 1   **\nJette ton pain sur les eaux, car tu le trouveras au bout de plusieurs jours.  **\nLa formation signifie aussi que la personne ne sait pas comment faire les choses. Montrez-lui comment faire. La personne ne sait pas conduire une voiture, vous la formez. La personne ne sait pas construire une table comme menuisier, vous la formez.\nFormer un enfant signifie que vous avez une vision pour cet enfant. Il y a quelque chose, un objectif défini ou une direction que vous voulez chez l'enfant. Si vous n'avez pas de vision, la sagesse de la formation ne viendra pas. Vous ne saurez pas quels supports de formation utiliser. Mais si vous avez une vision de ce que vous voulez chez votre enfant, vous trouverez le matériel ou les outils à utiliser. Former un enfant dans la voie qu'il doit suivre.\nLa formation implique de savoir ce qu'il faut faire et ce qu'il ne faut pas faire. Elle implique la transmission de connaissances. Mettez la bonne connaissance dans votre enfant. Dites à votre enfant ce qu'il doit faire et ce qu'il ne doit pas faire. Quand il sera vieux, il ne s'en écartera pas. Il y a des gens qui ont appris à leurs enfants à se prosterner et à saluer leurs aînés. Ils se prosternent pour saluer même à l'âge adulte. Ils l'ont appris. Il y a des gens qui ont formé leurs enfants à la cuisson des aliments. Ils grandissent pour cuisiner des plats raffinés qui réjouissent le cœur. Vous les formez parce que vous avez la vision que vos enfants ne devraient pas être une honte dans la maison de leur mari. La parole de Dieu dit   « Éduque ton enfant. Impliquez-vous dans cette formation, même si vous êtes occupé. Employez des personnes à l'école, à l'église, ou vos relations et professionnels pour vous aider, si vous pouvez en trouver. Utilisez de bons matériaux de formation pour vous aider.  **\nEcclésiaste 4 verset 9 à 12   **\n9 Deux valent mieux qu'un; parce qu'ils ont une bonne récompense pour leur travail .\n10 Car s'ils tombent, l'un relèvera son compagnon, mais malheur à celui qui est seul quand il tombe ; car il n'en a pas d'autre pour l'aider à se relever.\n11Encore une fois, si deux personnes sont couchées ensemble, elles ont de la chaleur, mais comment une seule peut-elle avoir de la chaleur ?\n12Et si un seul l'emporte sur lui, deux lui résisteront; et un cordon triple ne se rompt pas rapidement.  **\nLes parents isolés ont également besoin de conseils dans ce domaine. Ils peuvent exiger la participation d'autres personnes à la formation des enfants. Ceux-ci ne devraient pas avoir honte de demander l'aide de leurs proches pour l'éducation de leurs enfants.  **\n3.4 Enseigner la Parole de Dieu aux enfants   **\nDeutéronome 11 verset 18 à 21   **\n18 C'est pourquoi vous déposerez ces paroles de moi dans votre cœur et dans votre âme, et vous les lierez comme un signe sur votre main, afin qu'elles soient comme des fronteaux entre vos yeux.\n19 Et vous les enseignerez à vos enfants, en leur parlant quand tu seras assis dans ta maison, quand tu iras en voyage, quand tu te coucheras et quand tu te lèveras .\n20 Et tu les écriras sur les poteaux de ta maison et sur tes portes;\n21 Afin que vos jours et les jours de vos enfants soient multipliés dans le pays que l'Éternel a juré à vos pères de leur donner, comme les jours du ciel sur la terre.  **\nPeux tu voir? Enseignez à vos enfants la parole de Dieu. Enseignez-leur toutes les doctrines   Salut, Sanctification, Restitution, Baptême dans le Saint-Esprit. Enseignez-leur la seconde venue du Christ. Enseignez-leur le mariage biblique. Enseignez-leur le baptême d'eau, que lorsqu'ils naissent de nouveau , ils doivent être baptisés d'eau. Enseignez-leur à tous la Parole de Dieu. La Bible dit que l'enseignement exige de la sagesse.  **\nColossiens1 verset 28   **\nque nous prêchons, avertissant tout homme et enseignant tout homme en toute sagesse; afin que nous présentions tout homme parfait en Jésus-Christ   **\nQu'utiliserez-vous pour amener l'enfant à comprendre l'enseignement ? Procurez-vous les supports pédagogiques. Procurez-vous le matériel pédagogique. Votre enfant a regardé de la pornographie et de mauvaises vidéos. Obtenez des films éducatifs et pieux pour vos enfants à regarder. Dites-leur les maux de la pornographie et des films impies qu'ils regardent. Avertissez vos enfants contre le mal. Éduquez-les. Procurez-leur des livres, comme la dévotion. Laissez les enfants apprendre à lire le livre de dévotion tous les jours, même à l'école. Dites-leur de porter le livre de dévotion à l'école. Superviser! Vérifiez si vos instructions sont suivies. Poser des questions. Demandez   « Lequel avez-vous lu aujourd'hui ? Qu'avez-vous appris à ce sujet ? » Vérifiez-le. Entraînez vos enfants. Enseignez-leur la Parole de Dieu. Obtenez de bonnes Bibles pour vos enfants. Apprenez-leur à lire la Bible. Donnez-leur des devoirs dans la Bible et quelques livres chrétiens. Qu'ils écoutent les messages sur CD et DVD sur la droiture et la sainteté. Dites-leur d'écouter un certain nombre de messages et de prendre des notes. Le Dieu du ciel qui vous a demandé de faire cela travaillera avec vous.  **\nMarc 16 verset 20   **\nEt ils sortirent, et prêchèrent partout , le Seigneur agissant avec eux, et confirmant la parole par des signes qui suivaient. Amen.  **\nLe Seigneur travaillera avec vous, confirmant votre parole, votre service avec des signes qui suivent. Vous verrez le résultat chez vos enfants. Le Seigneur confirmera votre service au nom de Jésus . C'est ce que Dieu attend de vous.  **\nProverbes 31 verset 27, 28   **\n27 Elle regarde bien les voies de sa maison, et ne mange pas le pain de la paresse.\n28 Ses enfants se lèvent et la disent bienheureuse ; son mari aussi, et il la loue .  **\nSeuls les parents qui sont nés de nouveau et qui aiment le Seigneur de tout leur cœur peuvent être de bons éducateurs d'enfants pour leur faire craindre Dieu et bien Le servir.  **\nMatthieu 7 verset 3 à 5   **\n3Et pourquoi vois -tu la paille qui est dans l'oeil de ton frere, mais ne regardes -tu pas la poutre qui est dans ton oeil?\n4Ou comment diras-tu à ton frère  Laisse- moi arracher la paille de ton oeil; Et voici, une poutre est dans ton œil ?\n5 Hypocrite, ôte d'abord la poutre de ton oeil; et alors tu verras clair pour ôter la paille de l'oeil de ton frère.  **\nPour conduire vos enfants au Seigneur Jésus, vos parents doivent être de vrais croyants. Pour les conduire du péché à la justice, vous aussi devez être juste et saint.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 4   **\nAPPLIQUEZ LA DISCIPLINE SCRIPTURALE À VOS ENFANTS   **\n4.1 Ne laissez pas les enfants seuls   **\nNe rendez pas vos enfants rebelles par votre insouciance. Vous passez tout votre temps devant la télévision au détriment de vos enfants. Certains d'entre vous sont tellement perdus à chercher de l'argent que vos enfants vont en enfer et par conséquent vous aussi allez en enfer, à cause de l'argent.  **\n2 Timothée 6 verset 10   **\nL'amour de l'argent est la racine de tous les maux, que certains convoitent après avoir transpercé leur âme de bien des peines.  **\nChagrins causés par les enfants! Oui , je sais que la question est difficile parce que vous devez travailler pour obtenir de la nourriture pour eux. Alors que vous vous efforcez d'obtenir de la nourriture pour leurs corps, qu'en est-il de la nourriture pour leurs âmes ? Alors que vous vous efforcez de les éduquer, que diriez-vous de les éduquer sur Jésus, la Sainteté et le Ciel ? Vous devez bien faire toutes choses. Vous devez juste venir à Dieu pour faire de vous un parent qualifié. C'est la responsabilité qu'Il vous a confiée et vous devez la maintenir. Une personne qui va à l'université pour étudier doit étudier tous les cours de sa discipline et doit tous les réussir; sinon, il n'obtiendra pas le certificat. Passez tous vos examens. Travaillez dur sur vos enfants.  **\n4.2 Appliquer la méthode de Planning Familial qui vous convient   **\nSi vous savez que vous ne pourrez pas vous occuper de beaucoup d'enfants, dites à Dieu   « Seigneur, je ne veux que ce nombre. Le désir des justes sera exaucé. Appliquez la méthode juste appropriée de planification familiale. N'écoutez pas ceux qui attaquent la planification familiale. Ils parlent du diable qui ne veut pas que vous sachiez la vérité qui vous rendra libre. Contrôlez le nombre d'enfants que vous portez afin de ne pas mener une vie stupide. Pour que vous ne viviez pas une vie de chagrin et d'amertume dans ce monde à cause des enfants. Mais pour vous qui avez donné naissance à de nombreux enfants avant de connaître la sagesse de la planification familiale, comptez sur Dieu pour qu'il vous montre sa miséricorde et vous aide.  **\nActes 17 verset 30   **\nEt les temps de cette ignorance auxquels Dieu a fait un clin d'œil; mais maintenant commande à tous les hommes partout de se repentir.  **\nPrésentez votre ignorance à Dieu et dites   « Que Dieu m'aide maintenant. J'ignorais ces choses. Travaillez dur pour susciter des enfants pieux pour Jésus, il en a besoin. Il a dit   « Amenez-les-moi, je les utiliserai en cette fin des temps . Je mettrai Mon Esprit en eux et ils prophétiseront.  **\nJoël 2 verset 28   **\nEt il arrivera après que je répandrai mon esprit sur toute chair; et vos fils et vos filles prophétiseront, vos vieillards rêveront des songes, vos jeunes gens verront des visions   **\n 4.3 Discipliner les enfants d'une manière pieuse   **\nDieu veut que vous discipliniez vos enfants d'une manière pieuse.  **\nProverbes 13 verset 24   **\n\"Celui qui épargne sa verge hait son fils, mais celui qui l'aime le châtie de bonne heure.\"  **\nCette Écriture dit que vous devez appliquer la discipline à votre enfant assez tôt dans la vie. Ne soyez pas si miséricordieux et compatissant que vous ne pouvez pas utiliser une canne pour battre votre enfant. Ô femme, ne hais pas ton enfant ! Ô homme, ne hais pas ton enfant ! C'est une mauvaise mère ou un mauvais père qui refuse d'utiliser la canne sur leurs enfants.  **\nProverbes 13 verset 24   **\n24 Celui qui épargne sa verge hait son fils, mais celui qui l'aime le châtie de bonne heure.  **\nCela signifie que celui qui aime son enfant commencera à le battre quand il sera encore petit ; assez tôt. \"Betimes\" signifie tôt. Faites-le tôt. Il n'est pas trop jeune pour recevoir la canne. Dieu qui a créé l'enfant dit   « J'ai mis un pouvoir miraculeux dans la canne comme j'ai mis un pouvoir miraculeux dans la verge de Moïse. Cela changera votre enfant ! Ne jouez pas avec la canne. Ne plaisantez pas et ne prenez pas la discipline avec la canne avec désinvolture. Achetez une canne et gardez-la dans la maison et informez-en votre enfant. Dites à votre enfant de le toucher. Dites-lui   « Il t'attend ». Cet enfant sera conscient de cette canne. Un jour, il peut dire   « Mère, cette canne est toujours là. Vous direz simplement  \"Laissez-le là.\" Son objectif de vous rappeler est d'entendre si vous lui direz d'aller le jeter. Dis non! Laisse-le ici. Il est là pour vous. Le mot dit qu'en battant l'enfant, vous lui démontrez un amour concret. Une partie de la discipline que nous donnons aux personnes qui travaillent sous nos ordres est perçue comme de la haine. Non! Nous voulons qu'ils soient meilleurs. Nous les aimons. Ce n'est pas que nous les détestons. Dieu veut que vous fassiez du bien à vos enfants, pour les protéger de Satan. Ne faites pas attention au pouvoir du diable. Suivez la parole de Dieu et vous verrez ses anges vous aider sur vos enfants.  **\nPsaume 34 verset 7 à 8   **\n7 L'ange de l'Éternel campe autour de ceux qui le craignent, et les délivre .\n8 Goûtez et voyez que l'Éternel est bon, béni est l'homme qui se confie en lui.  **\nLes parents chrétiens doivent discipliner leurs enfants d'une manière pieuse. Votre motif doit être pur. Il ne doit y avoir aucune partialité entre un enfant et l'autre. La cause du châtiment doit être claire pour l'enfant, afin qu'il ne le perçoive pas comme de la haine et de l'oppression. Il doit y avoir un contrôle dans la discipline et la méthode appliquée ne doit pas être celle qui blesse l'enfant. Recherchez toujours les conseils et la sagesse de Dieu. Faites en sorte que votre enfant voie Dieu dans la discipline.  **\nEphésiens 6 verset 4   **\nEt vous, pères, n'irritez pas vos enfants, mais élevez-les dans l'éducation et l'avertissement du Seigneur.\nCette Écriture montre qu'il existe la voie divine de la discipline et de l'éducation des enfants que la Bible nous décrit.  **\n4.4 Disciplinez vos enfants tant qu'il y a de l'espoir   **\nProverbes 19 verset 18   **\n\"Châtie ton fils tant qu'il y a de l'espoir, et ne laisse pas ton âme épargner ses pleurs.\"  **\nIl y a un moment où il n'y aura plus d'espoir. Il y a un moment où vous ne pouvez plus rien faire à cet enfant. Mais il y a un moment où il y a encore de l'espoir. Il y a un moment où vous prendrez la canne et il la méprisera. Mais il y a un moment où il a encore peur de la canne. Alors, châtiez votre enfant, utilisez la canne quand il y a de l'espoir. C'est ce que la parole de Dieu nous dit. Corrigez votre fils quand il y a de l'espoir et ne laissez pas vos yeux ou votre âme épargner la canne à cause de ses pleurs. Il y a des enfants qui se mettent à pleurer dès que vous prenez la canne. « Eh, désolé maman, je ne le ferai plus, eh ! Eeh », criant et hurlant. N'écoutez pas ces choses. Ne laissez pas tomber la canne. Un passant qui voit un homme corriger son enfant avec une verge et dit   « Non, ne le bats pas », est ignorant et n'aide pas cet enfant. Dieu dit que le parent devrait le faire à un enfant qu'il aime. Dites à Dieu de prendre le relais lorsque vous avez perdu espoir en votre enfant.  **\nPhilippiens 4 verset 6, 7   **\n6 Ne fais attention à rien; mais en toutes choses , par la prière et la supplication avec actions de grâces, faites connaître vos requêtes à Dieu.\n7Et la paix de Dieu, qui surpasse toute intelligence, gardera vos coeurs et vos pensées par Jésus-Christ.  **\nSi vous confiez toujours le cas de cet enfant difficile à Dieu dans la prière, vous serez en paix dans votre cœur.  **\n4.5 Soutenir votre conjoint dans le travail de discipline des enfants   **\nIl y a une différence entre la mère et le père à ce sujet. L'un est toujours le disciplinaire. Ce pourrait être le père qui est le disciplinaire. Parfois c'est la mère. En matière de discipline, vous, la deuxième personne (conjoint), tenez-vous tranquille. Puisque vous n'êtes pas le responsable de la discipline et que la mère fait maintenant son travail, un beau travail, en disant   « Hé ! Viens ici mon enfant ! Agenouillez-vous ici ! Je dis   agenouillez -vous et restez là ! Que le père ne dise pas   « Je suis un père miséricordieux », Au bout d'une minute, vous dites   « Cela ne suffit-il pas ? Dites-lui de se lever maintenant. Lève-toi de là, ta mère ne connaît pas la douleur que tu traverses . Vous ne savez pas que vous faites le mal. Parfois, c'est le père qui discipline l'enfant. L'enfant sait que si son père vient le prendre en charge pour son délit, ce sera terrible. Lorsqu'il aura fait le mal, un mal terrible que son père n'épargnera pas, il ira voir sa mère et tentera de lui acheter des faveurs , comme dire   « Maman, je veux laver ton linge. Maman, est-ce que je peux faire quelque chose pour toi ? Il essaie d'acheter sa mère. Il la soudoie pour que, lorsque l'entreprise commencera , elle vienne le délivrer. Il y a un dicton qui dit   \"L'oiseau qui appelle la pluie, la pluie tombera sur lui.\" Cela signifie que l'oiseau qui appelle la pluie sera battu par elle. L'enfant a fait une chose digne de châtiment, il doit donc être battu. Contrôlez-vous et laissez faire. C'est un commandement de Dieu. Lui résister et se combattre, c'est lutter contre la parole de Dieu. La discipline est inefficace lorsque vous n'êtes pas unis.  **\n1 Corinthiens 1 verset 10   **\n« Maintenant, je vous supplie, frères, par le nom de Notre-Seigneur Jésus-Christ, que vous parliez tous la même chose, et qu'il n'y ait pas de divisions entre vous ; mais que vous soyez parfaitement unis dans le même esprit et dans le même jugement.  **\nNe divisez pas les enfants; certains pour le père et d'autres pour la mère. Soyez unis ! Cependant, vous pouvez corriger en privé votre conjoint en cas de colère impie et d'excès dans la punition des enfants.  **\n4.6 Sachez que les enfants sont forcément idiots   **\nProverbes 22 verset 15   **\n« La folie est liée au cœur d'un enfant ; mais la verge de la correction l'éloignera de lui.  **\nLa bêtise! Pourquoi pensez-vous que votre enfant devrait tout savoir ? Dieu est même surpris par certains d'entre vous. Tu dis à ton fils   « Pourquoi ne comprends-tu pas ces choses ? Comment les comprendrait-il ? « J'essaie de vous faire comprendre ces choses et vous les faites toujours mal ? La folie est dans son cœur. Il dit  «Je pensais que si je le faisais de cette manière, cela ne causerait pas de problèmes. Je pensais! Je pensais!\" C'est de la folie. Cette verge est appelée « la verge de la correction », « la canne de la correction », « le fouet de la correction ». Il est conçu pour corriger. Cela éloignera de lui la folie et il deviendra sage. Chaque fois qu'il fait quelque chose, il sera prudent. Par exemple, vous avez envoyé l'enfant aller vous acheter quelque chose, il est allé voir qu'ils jouaient une pièce de théâtre à la télévision. Puis il s'est assis là et a regardé le drame jusqu'à la fin. Vous lui avez demandé   « Que t'est-il arrivé ? et il a dit  «Eh, en allant au magasin, l'argent est tombé de moi. J'ai passé tout mon temps à chercher l'argent et puis, j'ai enfin eu l'argent. Quand je suis arrivé au magasin, l'homme n'était pas là, alors je l'ai attendu. Si vous levez la baguette et dites   « Viens ici, tu vas recevoir douze coups maintenant. Le lendemain fera-t-il encore comme ça ? Non, il ne le fera pas.  **\n4.7 Désobéir aux règles impies du gouvernement   **\n Actes 4 verset 6, 18 à 20   **\n6 Et Anne, le souverain sacrificateur, et Caïphe, et Jean, et Alexandre, et tous ceux qui étaient de la parenté du souverain sacrificateur, furent rassemblés à Jérusalem. 18 Et ils les appelèrent, et leur recommandèrent de ne point parler ni enseigner au nom de Jésus.\n19 Mais Pierre et Jean répondirent et leur dirent   S'il est juste aux yeux de Dieu de vous écouter plus que Dieu, jugez-vous.\n20Car nous ne pouvons que dire les choses que nous avons vues et entendues.  **\nC'est ce que le Seigneur vous dit. Malheureusement, certains parents chrétiens dans le pays où le gouvernement leur dit de ne pas battre les enfants se soumettent aux règles sans savoir que Satan veut obtenir leurs enfants dès l'enfance. L'enfant vous appartient. Si vous désobéissez à ce gouvernement, vous obéissez au commandement de Dieu et il vous donnera la sagesse qui vous guidera sur la façon de gérer les choses. La foi en Dieu et l'audace vous aideront. Si vous frappez votre enfant avec la verge alors qu'il a moins d'un an, il ne peut pas vous dénoncer. À l'âge de trois ans, lorsqu'il entrera à l'école , il s'habituera à utiliser la canne sur lui lorsqu'il fait du mal et ne considérera pas comme une infraction le fait de le signaler au gouvernement. Ne craignez pas le gouvernement.  **\n\nPsaumes 24 verset 1   **\nLa terre est à l'Éternel, et sa plénitude; le monde et ceux qui y habitent .  **\nSi le Seigneur veut que vous restiez dans ce pays, vous le ferez. Il change les décrets des rois. Il l'a changé par Daniel. Il l'a changé à travers Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego (des gens qui étaient prêts à mettre leur vie en danger pour le Dieu du ciel). Le roi s'inclina devant Dieu et déclara que le Dieu de Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego devait être adoré et craint dans le monde entier   **\nDaniel 3 verset 28 à 30   **\n28Alors Nebucadnetsar prit la parole et dit  Béni soit le Dieu de Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego, qui a envoyé son ange et a délivré ses serviteurs qui se confiaient en lui, et qui ont changé la parole du roi, et ont livré leurs corps, afin qu'ils ne puissent servir ni adorer aucun dieu, sauf leur propre Dieu.\n29 C'est pourquoi je décrète que tout peuple, nation et langue qui parlerait de travers contre le dieu de Shadrach, de Meshach et d'Abednego, sera mis en pièces, et leurs maisons deviendront un fumier, car il n'y a pas d'autre Dieu qui peut délivrer après ce genre.\n30Alors le roi éleva Shadrach, Meshac et Abednego, dans la province de Babylone.  **\nMalheureusement, Dieu n'a pas beaucoup d'enfants courageux qui lui rendront honneur. Les enfants par lesquels Il peut agir dans de nombreuses nations. Ils ont peur et se soumettent servilement aux gouvernements de leurs nations à leur grand chagrin. **\n Jérémie 10 verset 1 à 3   **\n1 Écoutez la parole que l'Éternel vous dit , maison d'Israël!\n2 Ainsi dit l'Éternel   N'apprenez pas la voie des nations, et ne vous effrayez pas des signes du ciel ; car les païens en sont consternés.\n3 Car les coutumes du peuple sont vaines.  **\nLa pensée de Dieu est clairement révélée par cette Écriture   ne vous soumettez pas aux vaines coutumes et lois des nations impies qui sont destinées à détruire la justice.  **\n4.8 La Verge fait partie de l'Evangile de Jésus   **\nProverbes 23 verset 13, 14   **\n13Ne retiens pas la correction de l' enfant, car si tu le frappes avec la verge, il ne mourra pas.\n14Tu le frapperas avec la verge, et tu délivreras son âme de l'enfer.  **\nPouvez-vous voir que la verge fait partie de l'évangile de Jésus qui peut sauver un enfant de Satan et du feu de l'enfer ? L'utilisation de la canne fait partie de l'évangile de Jésus. Ne prêchez pas seulement avec la bouche à cet enfant. La formation implique l'utilisation de la tige. Cela chassera Satan. Cela fera échapper l'enfant au feu de l'enfer. C'est ce que dit la parole de Dieu. Ne vous inquiétez pas, il ne mourra pas quand il sera battu avec la verge.\nVoir l'emphase de l'Écriture, \"Tu le battras avec la verge.\" Il n'a pas dit  \"Tu le frapperas avec la main.\" Faire attention! N'utilisez pas votre main pour détruire votre enfant. Certains enfants en sont devenus aveugles. D'autres enfants sont devenus sourds à cause de cela. Les dents de certains enfants ont été arrachées par des parents méchants.\nNe soyez pas plein de colère lorsque vous corrigez votre enfant, car la colère ne suit aucune formule. La colère est trop rapide pour suivre une formule. \"Où est cette canne ?\" Et vous commencez à battre de toute façon. De cette façon, vous transmettez également une mauvaise formation à cet enfant pour qu'il aille le faire avec ses propres enfants. C'est mal. Vous utiliserez la verge. Il ne mourra pas et la verge chassera le mal de l'enfant et le sauvera du feu de l'enfer. C'est ce que la parole de Dieu nous enseigne.  **\nProverbes 29 verset 15   **\n\"La verge et la réprimande donnent la sagesse, mais un enfant abandonné à lui-même fait honte à sa mère.\"  **\nEst-ce que vous comprenez quelque chose ? vous êtes trop paresseux. Vous promettez toujours à l'enfant   « Le jour où je t'attraperai, hein ! Le jour où je me lève hein. Le jour où je me lève hein ! Procrastinateur! Vous vous faites du mal. Alors que vous vous levez et lisez la Bible et priez, malgré votre fatigue, levez-vous aussi et battez l'enfant quand il mérite d'être battu. Sinon, la honte viendra sur vous. La honte sera votre part demain parce que vous ne battez pas votre enfant aujourd'hui. Apprenez également à donner verbalement des instructions, des réprimandes et des corrections à l'enfant. Faites-le quand il a mal agi. Faites-le dans ses bons moments.   **\nProverbes 29 verset 17   **\nte donnera du repos ; oui, il réjouira ton âme.  **\nCorrigez votre fils et vous vous reposerez. L'influence du groupe de pairs sera brisée avec la verge. « Je t'ai vu avec ce garçon, viens ici et reçois des coups de canne. Tourne le dos. \"Maman, je ne sortirai plus avec lui. Papa, papa, je n'irai plus jamais chez lui. Je n'irai jamais là-bas. Je n'y retournerai plus jamais eih , eih .” Dieu dit corrige ton fils et il te donnera du repos. Vous avez parlé, parlé et parlé et ça ne marche pas. Vous parlez et parlez, et ça ne marche pas, utilisez la baguette et il vous donnera du repos.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 5   **\nDEMANDEZ À DIEU LA SAGESSE DANS L'ÉLEVATION DES ENFANTS   **\nPsaumes 119 verset 165   **\nGrande paix ont ceux qui aiment ta loi, et rien ne les offensera.  **\nToutes les corrections ne nécessitent pas l'utilisation d'une canne. Parfois, certaines personnes, quand l'enfant dort, diront   « Je sais comment le gérer », et commenceront à le battre dès son sommeil. Le garçon sursaute de son sommeil surpris. Il crie   « Eh ! Eh ! Eh ! Eh ! Papa quoi ? Papa que s'est-il passé ? Papa?\" C'est de la méchanceté ! Vous ne lui avez pas dit ce qu'il a fait de mal. S'il en a fait, il a oublié. Une telle approche peut provoquer un traumatisme émotionnel chez l'enfant et de la haine envers son parent.  **\n5.1 Toutes les corrections n'impliquent pas l'utilisation d'une canne   **\nSi un policier vient vous menotter les mains, ne lui demanderez-vous pas ce qui s'est passé ? Pourquoi est-ce que ce serait à votre enfant que vous feriez ce genre de chose ? Vous ne lui avez pas dit ce qu'il a fait et vous commencez juste à le battre. N'y aura-t-il pas un jour de jugement avant que les gens ne soient condamnés à l'étang de feu éternel ? Le jugement est pour que l'on vous dise votre faute, les raisons pour lesquelles vous êtes jugé et condamné. Le juge du tribunal ne dit-il pas au criminel sa faute ? Pourquoi alors bats-tu un enfant sans lui dire sa faute ? Cela ne lui causera-t-il pas des dommages psychologiques ? Vous pouvez avoir un enfant sage qui n'a besoin que d'un mot d'instruction et de réprimande pour perfectionner ses voies. Quand vous avez un enfant sage qui se perfectionne par un mot d'instruction, pourquoi devez-vous l'embarrasser en le battant ?  **\n Proverbes 23 verset 15, 19, 24 à 26   **\n15Mon fils, si ton coeur est sage, mon coeur se réjouira, même le mien.\n19Ecoute, mon fils, et sois sage, et guide ton coeur dans le chemin.\n24 Le père du juste se réjouira beaucoup, et celui qui engendre un enfant sage se réjouira de lui.\n25 Ton père et ta mère se réjouiront, et celle qui t'a enfanté se réjouira.\n26 Mon fils, donne-moi ton coeur, et que tes yeux observent mes voies.  **\nProverbes 9 verset 9, 10   **\n9 Instruisez un homme sage, et il deviendra encore plus sage, enseignez à un homme juste, et sa science augmentera.\n10La crainte de l'Éternel est le commencement de la sagesse et la connaissance du saint est l'intelligence.  **\n\nLes coups de votre enfant doivent également être contrôlés. Si les coups deviennent si fréquents, ils perdront leur valeur. Réduisez la fréquence à laquelle votre enfant est battu afin qu'il ne perde pas sa valeur. Assurez-vous que le taux de réduction n'affecte pas également l'effet de battre votre enfant. Faites-le de manière appropriée. Ne faites pas des coups le seul moyen de correction. Utilisez également des conseils verbaux ou des réprimandes si nécessaire. Parfois, vous pouvez simplement organiser une rencontre entre votre enfant et quelqu'un d'autre. Vous pouvez inviter quelqu'un et lui dire   « Parlez- en à mon enfant. Peut-être que lorsque je parle, il a peur et ne m'entend pas. Pouvez-vous m'aider à dire à mon enfant ceci, ceci, ceci et cela ? » Ça marche! L'enfant écoutera cette personne dans l'amour, dans l'amitié et comprendra, au lieu de \"Papa, j'ai entendu, je t'ai entendu. C'est bon, j'ai entendu », alors qu'il n'a rien entendu. La sagesse est profitable à diriger. Demandez à Dieu la sagesse pour la formation des enfants. Il vous donnera des méthodes réalisables sur chaque enfant.  **\nJacques 1 verset 5   **\n« Si l'un de vous manque de sagesse, qu'il la demande à Dieu, qui donne à tous généreusement et ne tresse pas ; et il lui sera donné.  **\n5.2 Aimez tous vos enfants de la même manière   **\nNe détestez pas votre enfant et ne le traitez pas comme s'il était de deuxième classe parmi vos enfants. Cela rendra l'enfant endurcir son cœur envers vous. Cela incitera l'enfant à détester aussi ses frères et sœurs, car en ce qui le concerne, \"Maman ne m'aime pas\" ou \"Papa ne m'aime pas\". Oui, nous voyons qu'Isaac aimait Ésaü et Rebecca aimait Jacob, mais n'apportez pas une telle chose si ouvertement à ces enfants. Demandez à Dieu de vous aider à aimer tous vos enfants, car Dieu nous aime tous. Si les enfants savent que vous en avez fait une classe de seconde classe, vous serez également un père ou une mère de seconde classe pour eux. Ne considérez pas comme une méthode de discipline pour l'enfant de nier que vous êtes son père. Cela peut détruire son attachement à vous pour la formation. Même s'il s'agit d'un enfant adopté, montrez votre amour et votre engagement à l'aimer et votre profonde préoccupation pour son bien et son succès. Si, pour une raison quelconque, vous avez acheté un cadeau et que vous ne lui offrirez pas parce qu'il a fait preuve d'entêtement, dites-le-lui. Vous donnez des morceaux de viande et vous en avez donné 2 ou 3 à un enfant et n'en avez donné qu'un à l'autre, donnez la raison.  **\nEphésiens 6 verset 1 à 4.  **\n1 Enfants, obéissez à vos parents dans le Seigneur car cela est juste.\n2 Honore ton père et ta mère; (qui est le premier commandement avec promesse ;)\n3 Afin que tu sois bien, et que tu vives longtemps sur la terre.\n4 Et vous, pères, n'irritez pas vos enfants, mais élevez-les sous l'éducation et l'avertissement du Seigneur.  **\nL'enfant ne sait pas quoi faire, pourtant vous accusez toujours l'enfant, vous le battez toujours. Vos yeux vers l'enfant sont comme le feu. L'enfant commencera à penser   « Que s'est-il passé ? Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait? Si j'ai fait le mal la semaine dernière, quand il m'a corrigé, est-ce que j'en ai fait un autre ? Mais quelle est la raison ? Pourquoi papa est-il toujours en colère contre moi ? Il se fâchera contre vous et se décidera   « Je sais que tu me hais ; faites de votre mieux !\" Alors, s'il vous plaît, soyez prudent. Ne commencez pas à battre l'enfant sans raison. Sans raison, sans raison claire, vous commencez à maltraiter l'enfant jusqu'à ce qu'il commence à penser que « Non ! Ce n'est pas mon père », ou commencez à vous demander   « Est-ce cette femme qui m'a mis au monde ? Non! Cette femme me déteste. Je pense que ce n'est pas ma maison. Ne provoquez pas la colère de vos enfants. Soyez sincère devant vos enfants. Rappelez-vous que Dieu vous regarde et veut voir la vérité, la justice et la sainteté de cœur en vous envers tous vos enfants.  **\n5.3 N'utilisez pas de mots méchants sur votre enfant   **\nProverbes 18 verset 21   **\n« La mort et la vie sont au pouvoir de la langue. Celui qui l'aime en mangera le fruit.\nVous maudissez toujours cet enfant ! C'est mal.  **\nRomains 12 verset 14   **\nBénissez ceux qui vous persécutent, bénissez et ne maudissez pas.  **\nL'enfant qui est têtu aujourd'hui sera bon demain, si vous lui accordez de l'attention. Lorsque vous avez attrapé de la fièvre et des maux de ventre qui vous ont tourmenté pendant près d'un mois, ne vous en êtes-vous pas remis ? Et si tu avais détruit cet estomac ? Vous n'auriez pas vécu. Soyez patient avec un enfant têtu aujourd'hui. Demain, l'enfant sera bon pour vous. Par conséquent, ne prophétisez pas le mal sur votre enfant. C'est contre la parole de Dieu. Rappelez-vous que c'est Dieu qui vous a donné cet enfant et Il a un but pour l'enfant. Pourquoi voulez-vous livrer cet enfant à Satan ? Ne savez-vous pas qu'en disant du mal de lui, vous ordonnez au mauvais esprit de s'emparer de lui ? Pourquoi remettez-vous l'enfant de Dieu, qu'Il vous a gracieusement donné, à Satan ? Ne faites pas cela.  **\n Jacques 5 verset 7, 11   **\n7 Soyez donc patients, frères, jusqu'à la venue du Seigneur. Voici, le laboureur attend le précieux fruit de la terre, et a une longue patience pour cela, jusqu'à ce qu'il reçoive la pluie de la première et de l'arrière-saison.\n11 Voici, nous comptons heureux ceux qui endurent. Vous avez entendu parler de la patience de Job, et vous avez vu la fin du Seigneur ; que le Seigneur est très miséricordieux et d'une tendre miséricorde.  **\nMatthieu 5 verset 22   **\n« Mais je vous dis que quiconque se met en colère contre son frère sans cause sera en danger de jugement ; et quiconque dira à son frère   Raca, sera en danger du conseil, mais quiconque dira   Insensé, sera en danger du feu de l'enfer.  **\nMatthieu 12 verset 36   **\n\"Mais je vous dis que toute parole vaine que les hommes diront, ils en rendront compte au jour du jugement.\"  **\nLuc 18 verset 7, 8   **\n7 Et Dieu ne vengera-t-il pas ses élus, qui crient vers lui jour et nuit, bien qu'il tarde à les supporter ?\n8 Je vous dis qu'il les vengera bientôt. Néanmoins, lorsque le Fils de l'homme viendra, trouvera-t-il la foi sur la terre ?  **\n5.4 Sacrifice pour le bien-être de vos enfants   **\nSacrifiez pour le bien-être de vos enfants dans l'éducation, les provisions et l'amour. L'amour est sacrificiel. Laissez vos enfants voir les efforts que vous faites pour leur bien-être, sinon ils vous maudiront. Beaucoup maudissent leurs parents aujourd'hui parce qu'ils ne les ont pas éduqués. Ils ne leur ont pas fourni de travail. S'il n'y a pas d'argent, faites-le savoir. Appelez vos enfants et dites-leur   « Ce n'est pas que j'ai l'argent et que je refuse de vous former. Vous-mêmes pouvez le voir. Portons-le. La vie n'est pas seulement dans l'éducation. Vous allez apprendre la menuiserie, vous allez faire des travaux de couture, et vous allez pour ceci ou cela. Dieu te bénira. Voir cette personne ; voir cette autre personne, est-elle allée à l'école ? C'est le travail manuel qui l'a rendu grand. Il est maintenant un leader dans la société. Prononcez de bonnes paroles, des paroles de bénédiction. Ils retiendront vos paroles. Cela leur donnera des encouragements. Si quelqu'un se moque d'eux, ils se tiendront sur vos paroles. Faites preuve d'humilité et d'amour avec vos enfants. Parlez-leur amicalement. Faites de vos enfants vos meilleurs amis.  **\nRuth 2 verset 13   **\nAlors elle dit   Laisse -moi trouver grâce à tes yeux, mon seigneur ; car tu m'as consolé, et tu as parlé amicalement à ta servante, bien que je ne sois pas semblable à l'une de tes servantes.  **\nPremiers Rois 12 verset 7   **\nEt ils lui parlèrent , disant   Si tu veux être aujourd'hui le serviteur de ce peuple, si tu le sers, si tu lui réponds et si tu lui dis de bonnes paroles, alors ils seront tes serviteurs pour toujours .  **\n5.5 Apprenez à jouer avec vos enfants   **\nApprenez à jouer avec vos enfants. Ne soyez pas du genre à fuir dès qu'ils vous voient arriver. S'ils jouaient, ils s'arrêtaient dès qu'ils vous voyaient venir. Partout devient froid et silencieux à cause de toi. Même le petit enfant qui pleurait essaiera d'étouffer son cri. Si vous faites comme ça, quelle est la différence entre vous et Satan ? L'enfant a peur de Satan, il a peur de vous aussi. Cela privera l'enfant de l'amour parental. Certains enfants vivent tourmentés dans la maison à cause de la peur qu'ils ont envers leur père ou leur mère hostile. La Bible dit     **\nPremier Jean 4 verset 18   **\n« Il n'y a pas de peur dans l'amour ; mais l'amour parfait chasse la peur, parce que la peur est tourmente. Celui qui craint n'est pas rendu parfait dans l'amour.  **\nL'amour parfait chasse la peur. Pourquoi? La peur a des tourments. Celui qui craint n'est pas rendu parfait dans l'amour. Si vous faites en sorte que vos enfants aient toujours peur de vous , ils n'auront pas vraiment d'amour pour vous. Cette terreur, cette peur bloquera l'amour et la joie véritables pour leurs parents jusqu'à leur vieillesse, et ce sera à votre mal. Vous constaterez que votre enfant quitte la maison et ne prend jamais la peine de vous appeler. Ils ne prendront peut-être jamais la peine de vous rendre visite parce qu'ils n'ont jamais appris à vous aimer; vous avez été une menace pour eux depuis l'enfance. Alors, ne rendez pas votre vie effrayante pour vos enfants. Soyez amoureux d'eux. Jouez avec eux amoureux .  **\n1 Corinthiens 16 verset 14   **\n« Que toutes vos affaires se fassent avec charité. »  **\nMarc 12 verset 29 à 31   **\n29 Et Jésus lui répondit   Le premier de tous les commandements est   Écoute, ô Israël ; Le Seigneur notre Dieu est un seul Seigneur;\n30 Et tu aimeras le Seigneur, ton Dieu, de tout ton cœur, et de toute ton âme, et de toute ta pensée, et de toute ta force ; c'est le premier commandement.\n31 Et la seconde est semblable, à savoir ceci   Tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi-même. Il n'y a aucun autre commandement plus grand que ceux-ci.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 6   **\nFORMEZ VOS ENFANTS PAR LA PAROLE ET LA PRIERE DE DIEU   **\n6.1 Conduisez vos Enfants sur le chemin de la vérité   **\nSoyez honnête avec vos enfants et conduisez-les sur le chemin de la vérité. Ne leur enseignez pas de mensonges. « Johnny, cet homme qui vient là-bas vient me déranger. Quand il viendra me demander, dis-lui que je ne suis pas là. M'as-tu entendu?\" Le garçon répond  \"D'accord papa.\" Quand l'homme arrive et demande  \"Est-ce que ton papa est à la maison?\" \"Mon père a dit, je devrais te dire qu'il n'est pas là.\" Très simple! Vous savez, quand ils grandissent, ils comprennent la vérité. Brossez et améliorez la qualité de la vérité qu'ils ont et laissez-les grandir de cette façon. Ne les transformez pas en menteurs. Ne les entraînez pas à mentir.  **\nDeuxième Jean 1 à 4   **\n1 L'aîné à la femme élue et à ses enfants, que j'aime dans la vérité; et non seulement moi, mais aussi tous ceux qui ont connu la vérité ;\n2 A cause de la vérité, qui habite en nous et qui sera avec nous pour toujours .\n3 Que la grâce, la miséricorde et la paix soient avec vous, de la part de Dieu le Père et de la part du Seigneur Jésus Christ, le Fils du Père, dans la vérité et dans l'amour.\n4 Je me suis beaucoup réjoui de trouver tes enfants marchant dans la vérité, comme nous avons reçu un commandement du Père .  **\nPrenez note des choses que vous dites concernant les autres en présence de vos enfants. Votre enfant le dira des autres. Un homme de Dieu est venu à la maison d'une sœur et la femme a donné du riz à manger à l'homme de Dieu. Vous connaissez le riz et son comportement . Je pense que la cuillère a heurté quelque chose et que le riz s'est éparpillé partout. Quand l'homme a fini de manger et est parti. La femme est venue avec sa fille pour débarrasser les assiettes. Pendant qu'elle le faisait, elle a remarqué   « Je n'aime pas les gens qui mangent comme des singes. Regardez le riz éparpillé sur le sol. L'enfant a entendu mais n'a rien dit à ce moment-là. Quelque temps plus tard, quand elle a vu cet homme de Dieu venir leur rendre visite, elle a couru vers sa mère et a dit   « Maman ! Momie! Cet homme qui mange comme un singe arrive. La mère a mis un langage grossier dans la bouche de l'enfant. La petite fille l'a attrapé et la mère est coupable d'avoir appris à l'enfant à parler un langage grossier.  **\nÉzéchiel 16 verset 44   **\n \"Voici, quiconque use de proverbes utilisera ce proverbe contre toi, disant   Telle est la mère, telle est sa fille.\"  **\nSi vous voulez parfois parler de quelque chose, même de bonnes choses, il vaut mieux excuser l'enfant ou le tenir éloigné de l'enfant, car il n'est pas assez vieux pour comprendre un tel langage. Sa pensée à ce sujet sera puérile.  **\n1 Corinthiens 13 verset 11   **\n\"Parce que quand j'étais enfant, je pensais comme un enfant, mais quand je suis devenu adulte, j'ai rangé les choses enfantines. Apprenez-leur à marcher dans la vérité de Dieu. C'est ce que Dieu attend de vous.  **\n6.2 Priez toujours pour vos enfants   **\nPrière! Prière!! Prière!!! Pour recevoir un enfant de Dieu, la prière est nécessaire. Pour garder l'enfant dans la justice de Dieu, la prière est nécessaire.  ** \nEphésiens 6 verset 18   **\n\"Priant toujours avec toute prière et supplication dans l'Esprit, et veillant à cela avec toute persévérance et supplication pour tous les saints.\"  **\nLa prière génère du pouvoir. Priez pour vos enfants. Priez pour eux un par un. Le Seigneur vous entendra.  **\nPsaume 3 verset 4   **\n« J'ai crié à l'Éternel de ma voix, et il m'a exaucé de sa montagne sainte. Sélah.  **\nPsaume 4 verset 3   **\n«Mais sachez que l'Éternel a mis à part celui qui est pieux pour lui-même, l' Éternel entendra quand je l'invoquerai. \"  **\nPriez avec le jeûne. Que toute la famille prie.  **\nMarc 9 verset 29   **\n29 Et il leur dit   Cette espèce ne peut sortir que par la prière et le jeûne.  **\nLa famille peut fixer un jour, le jour des enfants, pour jeûner et prier pour les enfants. Le pouvoir de la prière sur votre enfant l'empêchera d'être initié par Satan. L'ennemi peut essayer de le faire, mais cela ne fonctionnera pas ; parce qu'il s'est engagé envers Dieu. Si vous pensez que votre enfant a été initié à la sorcellerie et que vous lui avez dit d'avouer mais qu'il n'avoue pas, n'utilisez pas la force. La force ne fera rien. Allez à Jésus. L'enfant d'une femme a été tourmenté par un démon. Elle est allée vers Jésus et a dit   « Seigneur Jésus, ma fille est couchée à la maison, tourmentée par le diable. Elle a cherché Jésus. Elle a prié, elle a crié à Jésus   « Aie pitié ». Elle a attiré l'attention de Jésus et sa fille a été délivrée immédiatement. Demandez à Jésus de s'occuper de ce cas démoniaque de votre fils ou de votre fille et vous l'aurez fait.  **\nMatthieu 15 verset 22 à 28   **\n22 Et voici, une femme de Canaan sortit des mêmes côtes, et lui cria, disant   Aie pitié de moi, ô Seigneur, fils de David ; ma fille est affreusement vexée d'un démon.\n23 Mais il ne lui répondit pas un mot. Et ses disciples s'approchèrent et le prièrent, disant  Renvoie-la; car elle crie après nous.\n24 Mais il répondit et dit   Je ne suis envoyé qu'aux brebis perdues de la maison d'Israël.\n25Alors elle vint et l'adora, disant   Seigneur, aide-moi.\n26 Mais il répondit et dit   Il ne convient pas de prendre le pain des enfants et de le jeter aux chiens.\n27 Et elle dit   Vérité, Seigneur ; pourtant les chiens mangent les miettes qui tombent de la table de leurs maîtres.\n28Alors Jésus répondit et lui dit  Ô femme, ta foi est grande, qu'il te soit fait comme tu veux. Et sa fille fut guérie à partir de cette heure même.  **\nRéglez-le avec Jésus, ce démon disparaîtra. Naturellement, toutes ces propriétés disparaîtront d'elle. Ils disparaîtront de lui. C'est par la prière. Ce n'est pas en le battant ou en la menaçant avec des mots   « Je vais t'arracher l'œil. Dieu ne soutiendra pas ce genre de chose. Le Seigneur a plusieurs façons de le convaincre et de le faire avouer et d'être délivré. Confiance en Dieu. Invoquez Dieu. Le Seigneur peut le faire lui-même ou vous conduire vers d'autres pour prier pour lui. Accrochez-vous fermement à Dieu pour la délivrance de votre enfant.  **\nEsaïe 49 verset 24 à 26   **\n24La proie sera-t-elle enlevée au puissant, ou le captif légitime sera-t-il délivré ?\n25Mais ainsi dit l'Eternel  Même les captifs des puissants seront enlevés, et la proie des terribles sera délivrée, car je combattrai contre toi , et je sauverai tes enfants.\n26Et je nourrirai de leur propre chair ceux qui t'oppriment; et ils s'enivreront de leur propre sang, comme de moût; et toute chair saura que moi, l'Éternel, je suis ton sauveur et ton rédempteur, le puissant de Jacob.  **\nPrier. Prenez le temps de prier et de croire Dieu.  **\nMatthieu 18 verset 18   **\n« En vérité, je vous le dis, tout ce que vous lierez sur la terre sera lié dans les cieux et tout ce que vous délierez sur la terre sera délié dans les cieux. \"  **\nTenez-vous sur les promesses de Dieu. Cela fonctionnera. Liez le diable dans sa vie. Détachez-le de son pouvoir. Si votre femme est dans une société secrète ou si votre mari est un sorcier ou si un membre de votre famille est dans le royaume des ténèbres, allez régler cela avec Dieu, ce démon perdra son pouvoir. Vous régnerez sur cette affaire. Vous régnerez sur cette situation. Votre prière s'en chargera. Cela neutralisera le diable.  **\nLuc 10 verset 17 à 20   **\n17 Et les soixante-dix revinrent avec joie, disant   Seigneur, même les démons nous sont soumis par ton nom.\n18 Et il leur dit   Je vis Satan comme un éclair tomber du ciel.\n19 Voici, je vous donne le pouvoir de marcher sur les serpents et les scorpions, et sur toute la puissance de l'ennemi, et rien ne vous fera aucun mal.\n20 Cependant, ne vous réjouissez pas de ce que les esprits vous sont soumis ; mais réjouissez-vous plutôt, car vos noms sont inscrits dans les cieux.  **\n\nJob 22 verset 26 à 28   **\n26Car alors tu auras ton plaisir dans le Tout-Puissant, et tu lèveras ta face vers Dieu.\n27Tu lui feras ta prière, et il t'exaucera, et tu accompliras tes vœux.\n28Tu décréteras aussi une chose, et elle te sera établie , et la lumière brillera sur tes voies.  **\nDemandez à Dieu ce que vous voulez pour vos enfants. Il y a une femme qui est venue à Jésus, mais sa prière était fausse. Sa venue a été bonne et elle a dit   « Seigneur, peux-tu répondre à ma demande ? Il répondit  \"Que veux-tu que je fasse pour toi?\" Si elle avait demandé autre chose, le Seigneur l'aurait fait, mais elle a demandé une mauvaise chose. Elle a dit   « Je veux que tu fasses asseoir mes deux enfants, un de chaque côté de ton trône dans ton royaume. C'était parce que deux de ses enfants étaient des disciples de Jésus-Christ. L'égoïsme était à l'intérieur de sa prière.  **\nMatthieu 20 verset 20 à 23   **\n20 Alors vinrent à lui la mère des enfants de Zébédée avec ses fils, l'adorant et désirant de lui une certaine chose.\n21 Et il lui dit   Que veux-tu ? Elle lui dit   Fais que mes deux fils soient assis, l'un à ta droite et l'autre à gauche, dans ton royaume.\n22Mais Jésus répondit et dit  Vous ne savez pas ce que vous demandez. Pouvez-vous boire la coupe que je boirai et être baptisés du baptême dont je suis baptisé? Ils lui disent   Nous pouvons.\n23 Et il leur dit   Vous boirez vraiment de ma coupe, et vous serez baptisés du baptême dont je suis baptisé ; mais s'asseoir à ma droite et à ma gauche, ce n'est pas à moi de le donner, mais il sera donné. à ceux pour qui il est préparé de Mon Père.  **\n Mais quant à vous, que voulez-vous chez votre enfant ? Si vous priez selon la volonté de Dieu, il vous entendra et cela arrivera à votre fils. Cela arrivera à votre fille. Continuez à prier pour leur mariage. Continuez à prier pour un mari pieux pour elle. Continuez à prier pour une femme pieuse pour lui. Au cas où il est encore dans le péché et n'est pas né de nouveau et est dans l'âge du mariage, il y a des différences entre les pécheurs ; il y a des pécheurs qui peuvent se repentir facilement et il y a des pécheurs dont la repentance est loin d'eux. Priez ainsi   « Que Dieu choisisse pour ma fille. Choisissez pour mon fils. Guidez-le, dirigez-le. Le Seigneur répondra à vos prières. Priez pour eux dans leurs écoles.  **\n\n\nEphésiens 1 verset 16 à 18.  **\n16 Ne cessant de rendre grâces pour vous, faisant mention de vous dans mes prières ; 17 Afin que le Dieu de Notre-Seigneur Jésus-Christ, le Père de gloire, vous donne l'esprit de sagesse et de révélation dans sa connaissance.  **\n\n\nChapitre 7   **\nÉLEVER DES ENFANTS PIEUX   **\n7.1 La formation des enfants est la responsabilité de la société chrétienne   **\nSachez que susciter des enfants pieux n'est pas seulement la responsabilité de la mère, du père ou des parents immédiats. De nombreuses personnes sont impliquées dans le devoir d'élever des enfants. Jésus-Christ a dit  \"Quiconque reçoit l'un de ces enfants en mon nom me reçoit.\"  **\nMarc 9 verset 36, 37   **\n36Et il prit un enfant, et le plaça au milieu d'eux, et quand il l'eut pris dans ses bras, il leur dit \n37Quiconque recevra un de ces enfants en mon nom, me reçoit , et quiconque me reçoit, ne me reçoit pas, mais celui qui m'a envoyé.  **\n Si vous pouvez prendre un enfant pour vous et former cet enfant pour Jésus, vous avez fait un grand travail. C'est Jésus que vous avez réellement reçu et que vous promouvez. Obtenez un enfant et formez cet enfant. Ce n'est pas seulement la responsabilité des parents, mais de la société chrétienne à laquelle nous appartenons tous. Nous tous, chrétiens, enfants de Dieu, hommes et femmes de Dieu, avons cette responsabilité de former les enfants, bien que les parents aient la première responsabilité.  **\n2 Timothée 1 verset 5   **\n5 Quand j'appellerai au souvenir la foi sincère qui est en toi, qui a d'abord habité ta grand-mère Loïs et ta mère Eunice ; et je suis persuadé qu'en toi aussi.  **\n2 Timothée 3 verset 15 à 17   **\n15 Et que, dès ton enfance, tu connais les saintes écritures, qui peuvent te rendre sage à salut par la foi qui est en Jésus-Christ.\n16 Toute Ecriture est inspirée de Dieu, et utile pour enseigner, pour convaincre, pour corriger, pour instruire dans la justice;\n17 Afin que l'homme de Dieu soit parfait, entièrement pourvu à toutes les bonnes œuvres.  **\nRegardez-les, Timothy a été formé dès son enfance. Par qui? Par Eunice sa mère. Mères, faites attention à l'éducation de vos enfants. Pères, faites attention à l'éducation de vos enfants. Parfois l'un des partenaires est plus disponible que l'autre ou l'un est converti et l'autre non. La responsabilité revient naturellement à toi qui est disponible, converti, vrai chrétien et visionnaire parmi les parents. Entraînez votre enfant ! Entraînez votre enfant !! Entraînez votre enfant !!! Enseigner à l'enfant la parole de Dieu. Conduisez cet enfant à Jésus, que ce soit par le jeu ou par une approche formelle. Quelle que soit l'approche, adoptez-la et faites-la.  **\n7.2 Soyez un Ami pour votre enfant   **\nLiez-vous d'amitié avec votre enfant pour faciliter son obéissance à votre parole. Mais ne lui deviens pas trop commun, de peur que ta parole ne perde de son pouvoir sur lui. Ne soyez pas trop joueur non plus, de peur qu'il ne communie et ignore vos paroles. De la formation de la mère, Timothy est né de nouveau assez tôt dans la vie. Lois a donné naissance à Eunice et a formé Eunice. Eunice a formé Timothée et l'a élevé dans la voie de Dieu. On m'a dit que la mère de John Wesley avait beaucoup d'enfants, une dizaine d'entre eux. Elle a accordé une attention à la formation de ses enfants. Neuf sur dix sont devenus de grands ministres de l'évangile. Le Seigneur attend que vous formiez vos enfants pour Lui. Il veut les utiliser. C'est la fin des temps . Il veut déverser le Saint-Esprit sur eux pour qu'ils fassent des merveilles en cette fin des temps . Donnez à Dieu des enfants à utiliser.  **\n7.3 Vous pouvez également former vos relations   **\nEncore une fois, non seulement les parents mais aussi les relations familiales peuvent former les enfants pour Dieu. Mardochée a formé Esther. Esther était la fille du défunt oncle de Mardochée. Alors Mardochée prit Esther pour qu'elle devienne sa fille adoptive et lui donna une véritable formation dans la piété et la justice. Celui qui reçoit un de ces petits enfants, Me reçoit . Et voyez ce qu'Esther a fait pour Dieu dans sa génération ! Esther est une source d'inspiration pour nous aujourd'hui. Pourquoi es-tu si égoïste ? Il y a des enfants de vos relations qui sont capricieux sans personne pour s'occuper d'eux. Bien que vous deviez faire attention à ne pas amener Satan dans votre maison pour la détruire. Pourtant, il y a ceux que vous pouvez atteindre avec le message et le salut en Christ. Vous pouvez les choisir pour les élever pour Jésus. L'un de vos proches est peut-être musulman. Pourquoi ne pas le persuader qu'un de ses enfants vienne s'installer chez vous ? Par cela, vous pouvez délivrer une âme de l'enfer. Dieu sera heureux avec vous que vous ayez changé l'avenir de cet enfant et que vous ayez délivré une âme de l'enfer. Il y a beaucoup d'enfants qui montent et descendent, sans parents ou avec des parents pauvres, que vous pouvez aider par la direction de Dieu.  **\n7.4 Vous pouvez adopter ou former des enfants dans les orphelinats   **\nOh! Vous n'avez pas d'enfants ? Vous pouvez en adopter un, deux, trois, quatre ou même cinq selon votre capacité à leur donner une formation adéquate. \"Celui qui reçoit un tel me reçoit .\" Si vous faites cela, vous rendrez un bon service à Jésus. Vous pouvez avoir un orphelinat où vous rassemblez tous ces enfants sans abri pour leur donner une formation chrétienne appropriée et vous rendrez un merveilleux service à Dieu. Vous pouvez être un enseignant pour enfants. Avec la présence du Saint-Esprit dans votre vie, vous pouvez amener ces enfants et les instruire. Vous pouvez aller dans les églises et demander la permission d'enseigner aux enfants. Un frère en particulier a dit qu'il était allé enseigner dans la section des enfants de son église. Il a enseigné le feu de l'enfer. Les enfants n'en avaient jamais entendu parler. Ils ont dit   « Hum ? Enfer? Où est-il papa ? Ils n'avaient jamais entendu parler de l'enfer. Ces églises rassemblent les gens et n'ont rien de significatif à leur enseigner. Chercher l'occasion d'enseigner à leurs enfants dans le service religieux. Qu'ils ne s'occupent pas seulement des adultes parce que les enfants n'ont pas d'offrande. Dieu est leur offrande. Jésus est leur offrande. Rassemblez-les et donnez-leur une formation car le leur est aussi le royaume de Dieu. Vous rendrez un merveilleux service à Dieu.  **\n\nCHAPITRE 8   **\nLE RÔLE DE L'ÉGLISE DANS L'ÉLEVATION D' ENFANTS PIEUX   **\nDieu a chargé les parents d'élever des enfants pieux pour lui. Chaque parent est responsable de cette obligation. Mais nous devons aussi savoir que l'église est également chargée d'élever des enfants pieux pour Dieu. La commission de l'évangile confiée à l'église comprend ce devoir.  **\nMarc 16 verset 15, 16   **\n15 Et il leur dit   Allez par tout le monde, et prêchez l'Evangile à toute créature.\n16 Celui qui croira et sera baptisé sera sauvé; mais celui qui ne croira pas sera damné.  **\nLe mot \"monde\" pourrait aussi signifier groupe de personnes. De là, le monde des hommes ; le monde des femmes; le monde des enfants; les adultes qui sont dans l'église viennent adorer Dieu avec leurs enfants. Alors que l'église cherche à leur faire connaître Dieu, croire en Jésus et se consacrer à la sainteté afin d'adorer Dieu de manière acceptable, l'église doit faire de même pour leurs enfants. Cela signifie donc qu'une attention particulière doit être accordée aux enfants pour leur faire comprendre clairement le message évangélique. L'église aura besoin de ce qui suit      **\n( i ) Aptitude à communiquer   **\nLes enfants doivent être prêchés d'une manière qu'ils comprennent afin qu'ils puissent croire et mettre en pratique le message de l'évangile.  **\n1 Corinthiens 14 verset 7 à 9, 11   **\n7 Et même les choses sans vie qui donnent du son, qu'il s'agisse de flûte ou de harpe, à moins qu'elles ne donnent une distinction dans les sons, comment saura-t-on ce qui est joué de flûte ou de harpe ? 8 Car si la trompette rend un son confus, qui se préparera au combat ?\n9 De même, si vous ne prononcez pas par la langue des paroles faciles à comprendre, comment saura-t-on ce qui est dit ? car vous parlerez en l'air.\n11 C'est pourquoi, si je ne connais pas le sens de la voix, je serai pour celui qui parle un barbare, et celui qui parle sera pour moi un barbare.  **\n(ii) Enfants Enseignants   **\nUne attention devrait être accordée à la formation des croyants avec la compétence d'enseigner aux enfants. Ceux-ci ne doivent pas être les faibles travailleurs de l'église mais des hommes et des femmes capables, nés de nouveau et saints, avec la vision et la passion d'élever des enfants pour Jésus.  **\n(iii) Matériel d'évangélisation efficace et aides pédagogiques   **\nL'église devrait fournir le matériel nécessaire pour l'évangélisation des enfants. Il s'agit notamment de livres, de vidéos et d'autres matériels qui guideront les enseignants des enfants dans leur travail. Les parents ont aussi besoin de ces matériels pour occuper leurs enfants à la maison.  **\nPremier Timothée 4 verset 13, 15, 16   **\n13 Jusqu'à ce que je vienne, sois attentif à la lecture, à l'exhortation, à l'enseignement.\n15 Méditez sur ces choses ; donne-toi entièrement à eux; que ton profit puisse apparaître à tous.\n16 Prends garde à toi-même et à la doctrine ; persévérez en eux, car en faisant cela, vous vous sauverez vous-même et ceux qui vous écoutent.  **\n2 Timothée 2 verset 15   **\n« Étudie-toi pour te montrer approuvé à Dieu, un ouvrier qui n'a pas à rougir, divisant avec droiture la parole de la vérité. \"  **\n(iv) Une église de bons enfants   **\nL'église devrait avoir un bon lieu de culte dédié aux enfants. Cela apportera du confort aux enseignants et aux enfants. Un bon logement permet une communication, une écoute et un contrôle efficaces. Lorsqu'un système de sonorisation est requis, il doit être fourni.  **\n(v) Programme spécial   **\nL'évangélisation de l'église et l'éducation pieuse des enfants devraient recevoir une bonne attention de la part de l'église. Par conséquent, comme l'église organise divers programmes pour les adultes, l'église devrait également organiser divers programmes spéciaux pour les enfants afin de les amener à Christ et de les rendre forts dans le Seigneur.  **\nProverbes11 verset 30   **\n« Le fruit du juste est un arbre de vie ; et celui qui gagne des âmes est sage. \"  **\n(vi) L'Église devrait prêcher et enseigner aux parents   **\nL'église devrait prêcher et enseigner aux parents de temps en temps pour les éveiller à la formation des enfants et leur faire voir les récompenses d'élever des enfants pieux pour Jésus.  **\nDeuxième Pierre 3 verset 1   **\n1Cette seconde épître, bien-aimés, je vous l'écris maintenant; dans les deux, j'attise vos esprits purs par le souvenir     **\n(vii) L'Église devrait soumettre les parents infidèles à la discipline   **\nL'église devrait soumettre les parents qui sont paresseux et négligents à l'égard de leurs propres enfants à la discipline de l'église pour leur faire connaître le sérieux que le Seigneur attache à l'éducation des enfants.  **\nPremier Timothée 5 verset 20, 21   **\n20 Ceux qui pèchent reprennent devant tous, afin que d'autres aussi craignent.\n21 Je t'ordonne devant Dieu, devant le Seigneur Jésus-Christ et devant les anges élus, d'observer ces choses sans les préférer les unes aux autres, sans rien faire par partialité.  **\nHébreux 12 verset 5 à 6, 11   **\n5 Et vous avez oublié l'exhortation qui vous est adressée comme à des enfants   Mon fils, ne méprise pas le châtiment du Seigneur, et ne faiblis pas quand tu es réprimandé par lui  \n6 Pour qui le Seigneur aime, il châtie et flagelle tout fils qu'il reçoit .\n11 Or aucun châtiment pour le présent ne semble être joyeux, mais douloureux, néanmoins après cela il produit le fruit paisible de la justice pour ceux qui s'en exercent.  **\n(viii) L'Église devrait organiser des prières et une intercession spéciales pour les enfants   **\nL'église devrait organiser des prières et des intercessions spéciales pour le salut, la guérison, la délivrance, la sainteté et le succès des enfants. Ceux-ci devraient inclure la prière et le jeûne, et la veillée nocturne. Ceux-ci devraient être faits régulièrement pour la bénédiction des enfants.  **\nMatthieu 19 verset 13 à 15   **\n13 Alors on lui amena de petits enfants, pour qu'il leur impose les mains et prie, et les disciples les reprenaient.\n14 Mais Jésus dit   Laissez les petits enfants, et ne les empêchez pas de venir à moi ; car le royaume des cieux est à de tels.\n15 Et il leur imposa les mains, et s'en alla de là.  **\n(ix) L'Église doit lutter contre les activités et l'initiation à la sorcellerie   **\nL'église devrait prêter attention aux activités démoniaques et à l'initiation des enfants parmi les enfants qui viennent d' enfants enseignants et d'autres enfants.  **\nProverbes 27 verset 23   **\n\"Soyez diligent pour connaître l'état de vos troupeaux et faites bien attention à vos troupeaux.\"  * * (x) Les agents démoniaques parmi les enseignants et les enfants doivent être retirés du bercail pour préserver la foi des enfants.  **\n (xi) Les guerriers de la prière de l'Église devraient visiter les enfants de temps en temps pour prier sur eux et pour traiter les cas démoniaques parmi eux   **\nLe moment où l'église de Dieu ne devrait pas seulement compter sur les parents pour la prière et la formation à domicile de leurs enfants, mais faire face à l'évangélisation des enfants comme un devoir de rendre leurs enfants justes et saints, c'est maintenant. Beaucoup de parents ne sont pas nés de nouveau ou ne sont pas membres de l'église. Certains parents n'ont pas non plus la connaissance de la vérité pour avoir un impact sur leurs enfants. Certains ne savent toujours pas gérer les questions d'initiation à la sorcellerie chez leurs enfants. L'église est investie du pouvoir et de l'autorité du Christ pour libérer les enfants du mauvais esprit. Que l'église se lève pour cette œuvre.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 9   **\nAUTRES AGENCES DE FORMATION DES ENFANTS   **\n9.1 L'Ecole   **\nL'école est un bras de la formation des enfants, mais pas au sens moral et biblique. Il offre une éducation aux enfants dans divers aspects. L'école utilise divers types de discipline pour enfants pour s'occuper des enfants et les soumettre à la formation pédagogique. Cela contribue positivement à de bons comportements chez les enfants. Cependant, les gouvernements de certains pays demandent aux autorités scolaires de ne pas battre les enfants. Au lieu de cela, ils apprennent aux enfants à signaler leurs parents aux autorités compétentes s'ils les battent à la maison. Ce décret a affaibli les efforts de nombreuses écoles sur les enfants. L'école a également un effet négatif sur le comportement des enfants en raison de l'influence du groupe de pairs. Beaucoup de mauvais garçons et filles corrompent d'autres enfants par amitié. Certains enfants sont initiés au culte ou à la sorcellerie par leurs amis. Parfois, ce sont les enseignants eux-mêmes qui gâtent les enfants par l'immoralité et l'occultisme. En raison de ces raisons et d'autres     **\ni ) Les parents doivent bien prier Dieu pour l'école appropriée où envoyer leurs enfants pour leur sécurité spirituelle.  **\nEsdras 8 verset 21 à 23   **\n21Alors j'ai proclamé un jeûne là, près du fleuve d' Ahava , afin que nous nous affligions devant notre Dieu, pour lui demander une voie droite pour nous, pour nos petits enfants, et pour tout notre bien.\n22 Car j'avais honte d'exiger du roi une bande de soldats et de cavaliers pour nous aider contre l'ennemi en chemin , parce que nous avions parlé au roi, disant   La main de notre Dieu est sur tous ceux qui le cherchent pour le bien. ; mais sa puissance et sa colère sont contre tous ceux qui l'abandonnent.\n23 Nous avons donc jeûné et prié notre Dieu pour cela, et il nous a suppliés.  **\nii) Les parents se réservent le droit de retirer leur enfant d'une école à une autre lorsqu'ils constatent l'influence néfaste de l'école dans la vie de l'enfant. **\niii) L'enfant doit être bien contrôlé lors de la visite des parents ou lorsqu'il rentre à la maison en vacances pour s'assurer qu'il n'est pas lié d'amitié avec des garçons mauvais ou qu'il n'est pas entré dans une vie mauvaise de quelque nature que ce soit.  **\niv) La sagesse exige ce qui suit de la part des parents   Comme les parents emploient le service d'enseignants à temps partiel pour donner des leçons supplémentaires à leurs enfants pendant les vacances ou même lorsqu'ils sont encore à l'école. Les parents chrétiens qui désirent une excellente performance de leurs enfants dans les affaires spirituelles devraient également donner un emploi à temps partiel à des frères ou sœurs chrétiens engagés pour enseigner à leurs enfants la voie du Seigneur à la maison pour compléter leurs efforts. Les avantages pour les parents sont plus importants que ceux tirés des excellentes performances des enfants à l'école.  **\nActes 18 verset 26   **\n« Et il se mit à parler hardiment dans la synagogue ; Aquilas et Priscille l'ayant entendu, le prirent avec eux et lui exposèrent plus parfaitement la voie de Dieu.  **\nv) L'école donne des cadeaux aux enfants pour les inspirer à de meilleures performances. De même, les parents devraient inspirer leurs enfants à une plus grande performance spirituelle en stimulant les dons.  **\nvi) Empêchez votre enfant d'être contaminé par les enfants des voisins , des membres de l'église et des relations. Les enfants mauvais influenceront vos enfants de manière mauvaise. Priez pour de bons amis pour vos enfants dans le quartier , à l'église et à l'école.  **\nvii) Vous pouvez vous arranger avec un parent pieux de la famille ou un ami pour que votre enfant soit avec sa famille pour des vacances. Votre enfant sera ravi de cette opportunité et s'humiliera sûrement dans le nouvel environnement. Cette condition lui fera prendre avec enthousiasme tout ce qu'on lui apprendra. Que Dieu vous accorde plus de sagesse alors que vous le lui demandez toujours.  **\nJacques 1 verset 5 à 7   **\n5 Si l'un de vous manque de sagesse, qu'il la demande à Dieu, qui donne à tous simplement et sans reproche ; et il lui sera donné.\n6 Mais qu'il demande avec foi, sans hésitation. Car celui qui vacille est comme une vague de la mer poussée par le vent et agitée.\n7 Car que cet homme ne pense pas qu'il recevra quelque chose du Seigneur.  **\nProverbes 8 versets 1 à 5, 14   **\n1 La sagesse ne crie-t-elle pas ? et la compréhension a fait entendre sa voix?\n2 Elle se tient au sommet des hauts lieux, sur le chemin, aux places des sentiers.\n3 Elle crie aux portes, à l'entrée de la ville, à l'entrée par les portes.\n4 À vous, hommes d'O, j'appelle ; et ma voix s'adresse aux fils de l'homme.\n5 O vous simples, comprenez la sagesse et, vous insensés, soyez d'un cœur intelligent.\n14 Le conseil est à moi, et la saine sagesse, je suis intelligent; J'ai de la force.  **\n\n9.2 La Confrérie   **\nPremier Pierre 2 verset 17   **\n« Honorez tous les hommes. Aimez la fraternité. Craignez Dieu. Honorez le roi. \"  **\nHébreux 13 verset 1   **\n\"Que l'amour fraternel continue.\"  **\nNous sommes frères en Christ, ayant le même Seigneur Jésus, la même espérance du ciel et le même but, la justice et la sainteté. En tant que frères, nous devons exercer l'amour fraternel les uns envers les autres, car nous sommes avertis d'aimer notre frère comme nous nous aimons nous-mêmes. L'amour fait du bien les uns aux autres et non du mal. Ainsi, la Bible dit     **\nDeutéronome 22 verset 1 à 4   **\n1 Tu ne verras pas le boeuf ou la brebis de ton frère s'égarer, et tu ne te cacheras pas d'eux; tu les ramèneras en tout cas à ton frère.\n2 Et si ton frère n'est pas proche de toi, ou si tu ne le connais pas, tu le ramèneras dans ta maison, et il sera avec toi jusqu'à ce que ton frère le recherche, et tu le lui rendras de nouveau.\n3 Tu feras de même avec son âne ; et tu feras ainsi de ses vêtements; et de tout ce que ton frère a perdu, qu'il a perdu et que tu as retrouvé, tu feras de même, tu ne pourras pas te cacher.\n4Tu ne verras pas l'âne de ton frère ou son boeuf tomber en chemin, et tu ne te cacheras pas d'eux, tu l'aideras sûrement à les relever.  **\nOn nous commande de nous aimer les uns les autres. L'amour va avec la bonne action en faveur de vos frères. Nous sommes encouragés, surtout entre frères, à nous entraider, à nous protéger et à nous encourager mutuellement. Si votre frère ou votre sœur en Christ a des enfants capricieux et que vous savez quoi faire pour les aider, cherchez à les aider en apportant une solution à la calamité de leurs enfants.  **\nJacques 5 verset 20   **\n\"Qu'il sache que celui qui convertit le pécheur de l'erreur de sa voie sauvera une âme de la mort et cachera une multitude de péchés.\"  **\nDans la mesure du possible, vous pouvez faire ce qui suit avec amour pour aider votre frère ou votre sœur dans les affaires de leurs enfants     **\nI) Aimez les enfants et recherchez leur piété.\nii) Corrigez les maux que vous les voyez faire et que les parents peuvent ne pas voir. Cela vous est demandé par Dieu. Faites-le avec humilité, amour et sagesse.\niii) Signaler les maux des enfants à leurs parents pour leur action appropriée.\niv) Exhorter et encourager les parents sur la formation pieuse des enfants.\nv) Donnez de bons matériaux chrétiens d'édification aux enfants pour encourager leur piété.\nvi) Priez pour les enfants de vos frères ou voisins afin que le Seigneur leur accorde le salut.\n(vii) Donnez de bons matériels de formation pour enfants aux parents et dirigez-les vers la bonne assemblée chrétienne où ils peuvent avoir de l'aide.\n(viii) Vous pouvez demander qu'un enfant d'un parent ou d'un autre frère reste avec vous ou vous pouvez adopter un enfant, juste pour les former dans la voie du Seigneur afin qu'ils puissent devenir des serviteurs de Dieu et des ministres dans Sa vigne. .  **\nEsther 2 verset 7, 20   **\n7 Et il fit monter Hadassah, c'est-à-dire Esther, la fille de son oncle, car elle n'avait ni père ni mère, et la jeune fille était belle et belle ; que Mardochée, quand son père et sa mère étaient morts, prit pour sa propre fille.\n20 Esther n'avait pas encore montré sa parenté ni son peuple ; comme Mardochée le lui avait ordonné, car Esther exécuta le commandement de Mardochée, comme lorsqu'elle avait été élevée avec lui.  **\n9.3 Orphelinat   **\nIl y a ceux qui ouvrent des orphelinats pour des raisons laïques. Mais les croyants peuvent ouvrir des orphelinats pour amener des enfants abandonnés ou souffrants afin de les élever pour Jésus. Ceci est fait avec un esprit pour les protéger du mal et les élever pour Jésus. Le Seigneur déversera abondamment ses bénédictions sur l'orphelinat et sur la personne qui le fera.  **\n2 Corinthiens 9 verset 8 à 14   **\n8 Et Dieu est capable de faire abonder toute grâce envers vous ; afin que vous, ayant toujours toute suffisance en toutes choses, puissiez abonder en toute bonne œuvre \n9 (Comme il est écrit, Il a dispersé, Il a donné aux pauvres , Sa justice demeure pour toujours .\n10 Or, celui qui donne la semence au semeur donne du pain pour ta nourriture, et multiplie ta semence semée, et augmente les fruits de ta justice ;)\n11 Etant enrichi en toutes choses en toute abondance, qui rend grâces à Dieu par nous.\n12 Car l'administration de ce service non seulement pourvoit au besoin des saints, mais est abondante aussi par de nombreuses actions de grâces à Dieu ;\n13 Tandis que par l'expérience de ce ministère, ils glorifient Dieu pour votre prétendue soumission à l'évangile de Christ, et pour votre distribution libérale à eux, et à tous les hommes ;\n14 Et par leur prière pour vous, qui aspirent après vous à la grâce extrême de Dieu en vous.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 10   **\nMESSAGE PROPHETIQUE DE DIEU A UN HOMME DE DIEU ET A SA FEMME SUR LEURS ENFANTS   **\nLe message suivant a été envoyé à un homme de Dieu et à sa femme qui servent tous les deux Dieu dans le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde  \n« Dis à Mon serviteur que J'aime son service pour Moi et que Je veux l'utiliser pour faire plus pour Moi, mais Satan utilise sa famille pour Me déplaire. Demandez à la femme   Croyez-vous en la doctrine de la sainteté que mon fils, le pasteur Rika, enseigne ? Si oui, pourquoi êtes-vous négligent avec les enfants que je vous ai donnés ? Savez-vous que vos enfants sont les miens ? Pourquoi autorisez-vous vos enfants à utiliser ces choses maudites   attaches pour cheveux, bijoux , pantalons, etc. qui peuvent les emmener en enfer ?  **\n1 Corinthiens 6 verset 9 à 11   **\n9 Ne savez-vous pas que les injustes n'hériteront pas le royaume de Dieu ? Ne vous y trompez pas; ni fornicateurs, ni idolâtres, ni adultères, ni efféminés, ni abuseurs d'eux-mêmes avec les hommes,\n10 Ni les voleurs, ni les cupides, ni les ivrognes, ni les injurieux, ni les ravisseurs n'hériteront le royaume de Dieu.\n11 Et vous étiez tels, mais vous êtes lavés, mais vous êtes sanctifiés, mais vous êtes justifiés au nom du Seigneur Jésus et par l'Esprit de notre Dieu.\nPourquoi n'avez-vous pas pitié de vos enfants ? Je te dis cela, ma fille, comme un acte de grâce envers toi dans HOREMOW ?  **\nTite 2 verset 11 à 14   **\n11 Car la grâce de Dieu qui apporte le salut est apparue à tous les hommes,\n12 Nous enseignant que, reniant l'impiété et les convoitises mondaines, nous devons vivre sobrement, justement et pieusement dans ce monde présent ;\n13 En attendant cette bienheureuse espérance, et l'apparition glorieuse du grand Dieu et notre Sauveur Jésus Christ ;\n14qui s'est donné pour nous, afin de nous racheter de toute iniquité, et de se purifier un peuple particulier, zélé pour les bonnes oeuvres.  **\nVous êtes celui qui aide ces enfants à être comme ils sont grâce à votre compromis. Lorsque vous ne connaissiez pas cette vérité, votre mari était dur avec vous parce qu'il voulait que vous changiez. Toi aussi tu t'es obstiné contre Moi en refusant d'enlever ces propriétés de Jézabel sur ton corps. Cependant, je suis intervenu en vous révélant la vérité. Pourquoi ne leur imposez-vous pas cela jusqu'à ce que j'intervienne, même s'ils résistent ? Cela Me peine de vous voir, vous et votre mari, prêter peu d'attention à imposer cette vérité à vos enfants.\nJe veux que vous sachiez que Ma venue est proche. Je ne veux pas que vos enfants aillent en enfer, compte tenu du dévouement de Mon serviteur, votre mari, à Mon Mouvement, le Mouvement Mondial de Réveil de la Sainteté. Pensez-vous que les enfants sont jeunes? Si rien n'est fait maintenant, vous ne les trouverez pas dans la vérité demain. Vous les gâtez par vos douces relations. Vous exaucez tous leurs désirs !\nMes yeux sont sur ta maison où Satan a mis la main sur tes enfants au sang de Mon cœur. Vos enfants saignent Mon cœur. Si vous M'avez donné cette maison, tout autour de vous doit être pour Jésus. Tant qu'ils sont dans la maison, ils doivent se conformer à la norme. Lorsqu'ils sont absents, ils sont libres de vivre comme ils le souhaitent, mais pas dans votre maison.\nLa négligence du caractère des enfants m'a fait juger la maison d'Eli.  **\nPremier Samuel 3 verset 12, 13   **\n12En ce jour-là, j'accomplirai contre Eli tout ce que j'ai dit concernant sa maison; quand je commencerai, je finirai aussi.\n13 Car je lui ai dit que je jugerai sa maison pour toujours pour l'iniquité qu'il connaît ; parce que ses fils se sont rendus vils, et il ne les a pas retenus.  **\n Votre mari me plaît et est déterminé à me servir. Je ne veux pas qu'il me demande dans le temps pourquoi je n'ai pas sauvé ses enfants.  **\n\nActes 16 verset 31   **\n« Et ils dirent   Crois au Seigneur Jésus-Christ, et tu seras sauvé, ainsi que ta maison. »  **\n Ma venue est si proche . Vous mettez les enfants à l'aise dans tous les modes de vie. Pourquoi assouvir leurs désirs fous même sur des choses pécheresses ? À cause de ce que votre mari fait pour Moi dans Mon Mouvement, Satan veut l'attaquer comme il l'a fait contre Job. Il cherche à détruire ses enfants. Ne tentez pas votre mari de se plaindre contre Moi. Vos enfants ne sont pas entièrement couverts par Ma couverture. Votre fille peut s'habiller comme Jézabel et venir dans Ma maison d'adoration et vous n'y faites rien ? Je veux que vous sachiez que Mon désir est que les gens autour de vous sachent que vous ne faites pas de compromis. Voyez Mon serviteur Paul Rika, ses relations tremblent pour venir à lui dans leurs atours jézabéliques . Ils cachent ces propriétés avant de venir à lui. Bien que ce soit un faux-semblant, il est bon pour Moi que Mon serviteur soit dur avec eux. Maintenant, vos enfants croient que c'est le pasteur Paul Rika qui influence leurs parents contre eux, parce que vous êtes personnellement indifférent à leur mondanité.\nVotre mari travaille parmi les jeunes pour Moi. Maintenant, les jeunes du monde entier accomplissent leur mission spirituelle. Et vos enfants ? Suivent-ils Ma mission ? Ne devrait-il pas être un exemple pour ses enfants ?  **\n\nTite 1 verset 5, 6   **\n5 C'est pourquoi je t'ai laissé en Crète, afin que tu mettes en ordre ce qui manque , et que tu ordonnes des anciens dans chaque ville, comme je t'avais désigné ; 6 Si quelqu'un est irréprochable, le mari d'une seule femme, ayant des enfants fidèles, non accusés d'émeute ou d'indiscipline.  **\nSi vous ne vous levez pas pour les gérer maintenant, dans votre vieillesse, vous aurez honte de vous-même. Dans vos yeux, vous les verrez marcher en enfer. J'apprécie le service de Mon Serviteur dans Mon Mouvement, mais le record est sous son nom seul. Votre sacrifice aussi est à votre seul compte, car vos enfants n'en hériteront pas.  **\nEzéchiel 18 verset 4 à 5, 10, 13   **\n4 Voici, toutes les âmes sont à moi; comme l'âme du père, ainsi aussi l'âme du fils est à moi ; l'âme qui pèche , elle mourra.\n5 Mais si un homme est juste et fait ce qui est licite et droit, 10 s'il engendre un fils qui est un voleur, un effusion de sang, et qui fait la même chose à l'une de ces choses,\n13A-t-il donné sur l'usure, et a-t-il augmenté, vivra-t-il alors? il ne vivra pas, il a fait toutes ces abominations; il mourra sûrement; son sang sera sur lui.  **\nJe vois que je perds tes enfants. Femme, tu n'aimes pas ces enfants plus que Moi. Vos enfants sont délibérément désobéissants, mais leurs parents leur prodiguent de l'argent. Sachez que votre argent est à moi et vous m'en rendrez compte. Mon serviteur, ne gaspille pas ton argent pour acheter des choses mauvaises pour tes enfants. N'utilisez pas votre argent pour les garder dans l'obscurité. Votre argent devrait être utilisé pour améliorer les gens pour le ciel. Ne jouez pas avec le péché ; être ferme et discipliné.  **\nGenèse 18 verset 17 à 19   **\n17 Et l'Éternel dit   Cacherai-je à Abraham ce que je fais ?\n18 Voyant qu'Abraham deviendra certainement une nation grande et puissante, et que toutes les nations de la terre seront bénies en lui ?\n19 Car je le connais, qu'il commandera à ses enfants et à sa maison après lui, et qu'ils garderont le chemin de l'Éternel, pour pratiquer la justice et le jugement; afin que l'Éternel fasse venir sur Abraham ce qu'il a dit de lui.  **\nQuand le Seigneur m'a donné ce message pour cet homme de Dieu et sa femme, j'étais confus. \"Ce message n'est-il pas trop dur?\" J'ai raisonné. Ne diraient-ils pas que je les incite à haïr leurs enfants ? Le Seigneur répondit   « Que veux-tu dire ? Y a-t-il de la haine dans ce message ? Préfèrent-ils les richesses de ce monde pour leurs enfants que le ciel ?   **\n Marc 8 verset 36, 37   **\n36 Car à quoi servira-t-il à un homme de gagner le monde entier et de perdre son âme ?\n37 Ou que donnera un homme en échange de son âme ?  **\nLe Seigneur continue   « Demandez à la femme   depuis combien de temps êtes-vous à HOREMOW ? Voyez-vous vos enfants s'améliorer dans l'amour de Dieu d'année en année, grâce à votre douceur ? Le Seigneur a poursuivi   « À cause de vos enfants, beaucoup vous regardent comme un prétendant. Au moment où ils deviendront adultes, ils seront eux-mêmes déchaînés contre vous, car vous les entraînez à aimer le monde.\nHomme, reprends ton autorité sur tes enfants. Si vous aimez vraiment vos enfants. Sauvegardez-les maintenant. Le temps de Ma venue est proche.  **\nPhilippiens 4 verset 5   **\n« Que votre modération soit connue de tous les hommes. Le Seigneur est proche.  **\nFemme, il y a des choses que tu permets aux enfants d'acheter qui sont mauvaises. Dans les magasins, ils choisissent des choses maléfiques   attaches pour cheveux, tissage, pantalons, chaussures à talons hauts, bijoux, propriété maléfique de la parure et de la parure corporelle, et vous achetez ces choses pour eux ! Lors d'une cérémonie de mariage à laquelle vous avez assisté, votre enfant a été appelé, selon le calendrier du programme , à remettre une alliance au ministre pour la fixer entre les doigts de la mariée et du marié. Peux-tu dire toi \nn'étaient pas au courant, avant cet événement, de ce que votre fille devait faire pendant le mariage, ce que j'interdis ? »  **\nApocalypse 3 verset 19 à 22   **\n19 Tous ceux que j'aime, je les reprends et je les châtie, ayez donc du zèle et repentez-vous.\n20 Voici, je me tiens à la porte et je frappe. Si quelqu'un entend ma voix et ouvre la porte, j'entrerai chez lui, je souperai avec lui, et lui avec moi.\n21 Celui qui vaincra, je le ferai asseoir avec moi sur mon trône, comme moi aussi j'ai vaincu et me suis assis avec mon Père sur son trône.\n22 Que celui qui a des oreilles entende ce que l'Esprit dit aux Églises.\n",

      "body": "TENUE DES DOSSIERS ET RESPONSABILITE DANS LE MINISTERE DE LA SAINTETE  **\n\nINTRODUCTION  **\nCe livre est écrit pour vous rendre saint, parfait, irréprochable et sans tache dans votre ministère et votre administration parmi le peuple de Dieu. En tant que dirigeants fidèles du peuple de Dieu dans tous les domaines du service chrétien, y compris les finances de l'église, les opérations et la gestion des actifs, Dieu attend de vous que vous lui rendiez un compte fidèle, et si nécessaire, aux hommes également   **\n2 Corinthiens 8 verset 21  **\nPourvoir aux choses honnêtes, non seulement aux yeux du Seigneur, mais aussi aux yeux des hommes.  **\nLisez ce livre dans la prière, implorant la grâce de mettre en pratique les instructions et les commandements scripturaires qui y sont décrits.  **\nLa bonne tenue des registres est une activité importante dans un ministère de la sainteté. Nous examinerons les Écritures pour révéler des récits d'activités enregistrées comme guide pour votre opération dans un ministère de sainteté.  **\nEn tant que membre engagé avec Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide par Dieu lui-même, je désire que tous les ouvriers et ministres chrétiens travaillant avec moi dans cette commission soient irréprochables et parfaits afin qu'ils puissent se qualifier pour la vie éternelle et les récompenses. Pour cela, je considère qu'il est nécessaire d'écrire sur ce sujet également  **\nMatthieu 28 verset 20  **\nEnseignez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai commandé   et voici, je suis avec vous toujours, même jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amen.  **\nColossiens 1 verset 28,29  **\n28 Lequel nous prêchons, avertissant chacun et enseignant chacun en toute sagesse; afin que nous puissions présenter tout homme parfait en Jésus-Christ; 29 A quoi je travaille aussi, luttant selon son oeuvre, qui agit puissamment en moi.  **\nCe livre est écrit pour éclairer tous les ouvriers et ministres chrétiens qui cherchent à servir le Seigneur dans la sainteté afin qu'ils puissent être protégés contre les rechutes et la corruption dans le ministère chrétien. Que le Seigneur trouve votre service bon, saint, acceptable et rémunérateur par lui tout au long de votre vie sur terre, au nom de Jésus .  **\n\nCHAPITRE 1  **\nL'ÉCRITURE SAINTE ET LA TENUE DES DOSSIERS  **\nLa Sainte Écriture est le livre de Dieu qui montre la pensée et l'œuvre de Dieu parmi les hommes. Cela nous donne également un indice sur les œuvres de Dieu dans les cieux et dans tout l'univers. Un coup d'œil aux Écritures nous montre comment tenir des registres de plusieurs manières parmi le peuple de Dieu. Les récits scripturaires de la tenue des registres comprennent des statistiques qui montrent le nombre de personnes, les membres de la famille, les généalogies, le nombre de premiers-nés, la participation aux réunions, les miracles et tout ce que l'avenir peut exiger de savoir sur le présent et le passé.  **\n1.1\tNécessité de la tenue de registres en tant que livre historique des faits  **\nDans l'Ecriture, des enregistrements ont été tenus des activités suivantes   le nombre de personnes qui ont mangé les cinq pains et les deux poissons, qui était de cinq mille hommes sans les femmes et les enfants ; le nombre des apôtres de Jésus, qui était de douze. Il y avait cent vingt personnes dans la chambre haute lorsque le Saint-Esprit est descendu sur eux à la Pentecôte. Deux personnes étaient en route pour Emmaüs lorsque Jésus les rencontra. Deux personnes rencontrèrent Jésus sur la montagne de la transfiguration   Moïse et Élie. Ainsi, nous pouvons voir que l'Ecriture est pleine de récits d'événements. Les registres des finances ont également été conservés. Nous verrons à partir des Écritures comment les questions diligentes des finances et des propriétés de l'église étaient gardées et strictement persévérées dans l'esprit de sainteté.  **\nL'Ecriture a également gardé le récit du mariage à Cana de Galilée et du miracle qui s'y est produit. Ces archives scripturaires ont été conservées afin que les générations futures sachent ce que Dieu avait fait. De même, le registre de la généalogie de Jésus-Christ a été conservé, retraçant la naissance de Jésus à Abraham pour montrer que Jésus est venu au monde selon la prophétie. Jésus est né de la lignée de David, pour être d'accord avec la promesse que Dieu a faite à David   « Ta semence sera sur le trône d'Israël pour toujours. L'Écriture tient également compte des prophéties de Dieu, afin que nous puissions observer leur accomplissement et connaître celles qui ne sont pas encore accomplies. Les récits des œuvres puissantes, des miracles et des promesses de Dieu ont également été conservés dans les Écritures.    **\nExode 17 verset 14  **\nEt l'Éternel dit à Moïse   Écris ceci pour mémoire dans un livre, et répète-le aux oreilles de Josué, car j'effacerai entièrement la mémoire d'Amalek de dessous les cieux.  **\nLuc a enregistré la vie et les œuvres de Jésus et de ses apôtres pour que les gens de son époque et toutes les générations futures sachent et croient. L'apôtre Jean a également fait de même.  **\n Luc 1 verset 1 à 4  **\n1 Puisque plusieurs ont pris l'initiative de mettre en ordre une déclaration des choses auxquelles on croit le plus sûrement parmi nous,\n2 Comme ils nous les ont livrés, qui dès le commencement étaient témoins oculaires et ministres de la parole ;\n3 Il m'a semblé bon aussi, ayant eu une compréhension parfaite de toutes choses dès le début, de t'écrire dans l'ordre, excellent Théophile, 4 afin que tu connaisses la certitude de ces choses, dans lesquelles tu as été instruit.  **\nJean 20 verset 31  **\nMais ceux-ci sont écrits, afin que vous croyiez que Jésus est le Christ, le Fils de Dieu ; et qu'en croyant vous puissiez avoir la vie par son nom.  **\nIl devrait y avoir des livres qui enregistrent l'œuvre de Dieu dans l'église parmi le peuple de Dieu, tels que les enregistrements des événements de Dieu, les enregistrements des œuvres et des prophéties de Dieu dans l'église, et les enregistrements des miracles qui sont accomplis. En effet, il devrait y avoir des registres pour presque tout, y compris les registres de ceux qui ont quitté l'église et pourquoi ils sont partis. Les archives sont nécessaires parce que demain quelqu'un voudra peut-être en savoir plus ou quelque chose de contraire peut arriver concernant le passé. Certains problèmes peuvent survenir et nécessiter un retour aux dossiers afin de déterminer la vérité. Bien que les personnes clés impliquées ne soient peut-être plus dans le système, ces livres d'archives raconteront toute l'histoire car les archives sont un livre de faits historiques.  **\nEsther 6 verset 1 à 3  **\n1 Cette nuit-là, le roi ne put dormir, et il ordonna d'apporter le livre des annales des chroniques ; et ils furent lus devant le roi.\n2 Et il fut trouvé écrit que Mardochée avait parlé de Bigthana et de Teresh, deux des eunuques du roi, les gardiens de la porte, qui cherchaient à mettre la main sur le roi Assuérus.\n3 Et le roi dit   Quel honneur et quelle dignité a été rendu à Mardochée pour cela ? Alors dirent les serviteurs du roi qui le servaient  Rien n'a été fait pour lui.  **\nEn raison de la tenue de registres, les bonnes actions passées de Mardochée sont entrées en mémoire et il a été promu par le roi contrairement au plan de son ennemi de le pendre.  **\n1.2 Dieu tient compte de ses paroles et oeuvre pour la postérité  **\nDieu ordonna à Moïse   « Dis ceci aux oreilles de Josué, écris-le dans un livre. Cela souligne l'importance de la tenue de registres.  **\nEsaïe 34 verset 16  **\nCherchez dans le livre de l'Éternel, et lisez   aucune d'entre elles ne faillira, aucune ne manquera de son épouse, car ma bouche l'a commandé, et son esprit les a rassemblés.  **\nÀ partir de cette Écriture, nous pouvons voir que le Seigneur tient des registres, même de ses propres paroles, activités, prophéties et événements. C'est le livre du Seigneur, la Sainte Bible, le livre de Ses instructions. Dieu a demandé à Moïse d'écrire les instructions qu'il donnait au peuple de peur qu'il n'oublie. Les êtres humains ont tellement de choses qui occupent leur esprit qu'ils peuvent facilement oublier des choses. S'il est nécessaire d'oublier certaines choses qui nous donneraient des douleurs et de la peur, il y a des choses que nous ne devons pas oublier. La mémoire de certaines choses est importante pour diriger nos pieds vers les bonnes actions. C'est pourquoi nous devrions avoir un livre d'archives, pour enregistrer et conserver des informations vitales sur les événements, les promesses de Dieu et les bénédictions dans nos vies. Cela aidera notre foi en Dieu à grandir et nous rendra plus sages.  **\nEsdras 2 verset 1 à 2  **\n1 Voici les enfants de la province qui montèrent de la captivité, parmi ceux qui avaient été enlevés, que Nebucadnetsar, roi de Babylone, avait emmenés à Babylone, et revint à Jérusalem et à Juda, chacun dans sa ville. ;\n2 Qui sont venus avec Zorobabel   Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mardochée, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baana. Le nombre des hommes du peuple d'Israël.  **\nIci, nous voyons avec quelle diligence ils tenaient des registres. Même lorsqu'ils emmenaient des gens de Juda en captivité, ils écrivaient encore les noms des gens qui étaient devenus esclaves. C'est très important pour eux parce que le Seigneur leur avait annoncé la venue du Messie et ils étaient diligents pour s'assurer que personne ne prétendrait être messianique s'il n'était pas de la lignée prophétique de David. Les enfants d'Israël ne doivent accueillir personne dans la tribu d'Israël qui n'est pas un Israélite, et pour qu'il soit un Israélite, son nom doit figurer dans leur registre. Ainsi, même en captivité, alors qu'elles mettaient au monde des enfants, elles écrivaient leurs noms afin que personne ne prétende être un Israélite qui n'en était pas un.  **\nLes Samaritains ont été rejetés du fait d'être des Israélites parce que, bien que certains d'entre eux soient en fait des Israélites, ils s'étaient mêlés à des nations païennes après leur déportation par un roi étranger, qui avait amené des étrangers pour habiter dans leurs terres. Ils se sont mariés et sont devenus métis. Pour cette raison, ils ont été rejetés. Les Israélites dirent   « Vous n'êtes plus des Israélites à part entière. Nous ne pouvons pas vous accepter parmi nous. C'était la dispute entre les Juifs et les Samaritains. Leurs noms ne figuraient pas dans le registre. Cela montre encore l'importance de la tenue de registres.  **\n1.2\tLa tenue de registres aide l'œuvre de Dieu et favorise l'évangélisation  **\n\nEsdras 1 verset 1 à 5  **\n1 La première année de Cyrus, roi de Perse, afin que s'accomplît la parole de l'Éternel par la bouche de Jérémie, l'Éternel excita l'esprit de Cyrus, roi de Perse, et fit une proclamation dans tout son royaume, et mettez-le aussi par écrit, en disant   2 Ainsi parle Cyrus, roi de Perse   L'Éternel, le Dieu des cieux, m'a donné tous les royaumes de la terre ; et il m'a chargé de lui bâtir une maison à Jérusalem, qui est en Juda. 3 Qui est parmi vous de tout son peuple ? que son Dieu soit avec lui, et qu'il monte à Jérusalem, qui est en Juda, et qu'il bâtisse la maison de l'Éternel, le Dieu d'Israël, qui est à Jérusalem. 4 Et quiconque reste dans un lieu où il séjourne, que les hommes de son lieu l'aident avec de l'argent, et de l'or, et des biens, et des bêtes, en plus de l'offrande volontaire pour la maison de Dieu qui est à Jérusalem . 5 Alors se levèrent les chefs des pères de Juda et de Benjamin, et les sacrificateurs, et les Lévites, avec tous ceux dont Dieu avait suscité l'esprit, pour monter pour bâtir la maison de l'Éternel qui est à Jérusalem.  **\nLorsque le roi Cyrus fit une déclaration pour le retour des Juifs, les anciens se levèrent pour superviser ceux qui allaient à Jérusalem et ils s'assurèrent que leurs noms figuraient dans le livre des annales. Cela n'a pas été fait avec insouciance, mais minutieusement pour s'assurer que seuls ceux qui se sont qualifiés y allaient. Ils ont déclaré   « S'il vous plaît, cet appel n'est pas pour tout le monde. Ceux qui vont à Jérusalem doivent être des Israélites dont les noms sont dans le registre. Nous ferons une vérification sur vous. Ils ont contrôlé certaines personnes et les ont refusées parce qu'elles ne pouvaient pas retracer leur généalogie. C'est la beauté de la tenue de dossiers. Une bonne tenue des registres fait partie de l'œuvre de Dieu. Dieu s'intéresse à cela parce qu'en entendant les récits des bonnes œuvres de Dieu, de nombreuses personnes se convertissent. Oui, quand ils voient les œuvres merveilleuses de Dieu, comme le dit un auteur-compositeur    **\nO Seigneur mon Dieu, quand je suis dans un émerveillement impressionnant **\nConsidérez toutes les œuvres que vos mains ont faites **\nJe vois les étoiles, j'entends le roulement du tonnerre **\nTa puissance dans tout l'univers s'affiche **\nAlors chante mon âme, mon Dieu Sauveur pour Toi **\nComme tu es grand, comme tu es grand **\nAlors chante mon âme, mon Dieu Sauveur pour toi, **\nComme tu es grand, comme tu es grand.  **\nLorsque Moïse a parlé à son beau-père des œuvres de Dieu, il a reconnu Dieu. Il suffit de les montrer.  **\nce que Dieu a fait parmi les hommes est suffisant pour attirer leur cœur à Dieu. Rappelez-vous que le roi d'Israël appela Guéhazi et lui demanda de lui raconter les œuvres d'Elisée. Alors qu'il racontait le miracle de ressusciter un garçon mort, il vit la femme et s'écria   « Ah ! Regarde la femme et regarde le fils qu'il a ressuscité d'entre les morts ! Vous avez vu comment cela a poussé le roi à pratiquer la justice. La véritable tenue de registres est très importante. Certaines personnes ne tiennent pas de registre précis; au contraire, ils exagèrent. Par exemple, quelques personnes peuvent être présentes à une réunion mais elles donneront un chiffre gonflé. C'est comme ça qu'ils font à certains endroits. L'Esprit de Dieu n'est pas là, parce que leurs annales ne sont pas vraies. Ainsi, ceux qui donnent de faux rapports n'ont pas l'Esprit de Dieu, parce qu'ils ne sont pas vrais. Dieu n'est pas un menteur.    **\n1.4 Une bonne tenue des registres bloque les mensonges de Satan  **\nMatthieu 1 verset 1 à 14  **\n1 Livre de la génération de Jésus Christ, fils de David, fils d'Abraham. 2 Abraham engendra Isaac ; et Isaac engendra Jacob; et Jacob engendra Judas et ses frères; 3 Et Judas engendra Phares et Zara de Thamar; et Phares engendra Esrom; et Esrom engendra Aram; 4 Et Aram engendra Aminadab ; et Aminadab engendra Naasson; et Naasson engendra Salmon; 5 Et Salmon engendra Booz de Rachab; et Booz engendra Obed de Ruth; et Obed engendra Jesse; 6 Et Isaï engendra le roi David; et le roi David engendra Salomon de celle qui avait été la femme d'Urie; 7 Et Salomon engendra Roboam; et Roboam engendra Abia; et Abia engendra Asa; 8 Et Asa engendra Josaphat ; et Josaphat engendra Joram; et Joram engendra Ozias; 9 Et Ozias engendra Joatham; et Joatham engendra Achaz; et Achaz engendra Ézéchias; 10 Et Ézéchias engendra Manassé; et Manassé engendra Amon; et Amon engendra Josias; 11 Et Josias engendra Jéchonias et ses frères, à peu près au moment où ils furent emmenés à Babylone ; 12 Et après qu'ils furent amenés à Babylone, Jéchonias engendra Salathiel ; et Salathiel engendra Zorobabel; 13 Et Zorobabel engendra Abiud; et Abiud engendra Eliakim; et Eliakimbeg à Azor ; 14 Et Azor engendra Sadoc ; et Sadoc engendra Achim; et Achimbeg à Eliud; 15 Et Eliud engendra Eléazar ; et Eléazar engendra Matthan; et Matthan engendra Jacob; 16 Et Jacob engendra Joseph, l'époux de Marie, de laquelle est né Jésus, qui est appelé Christ. 17 Ainsi toutes les générations depuis Abraham jusqu'à David sont quatorze générations ; et depuis David jusqu'à la déportation à Babylone, il y a quatorze générations ; et depuis la déportation à Babylone jusqu'à Christ, il y a quatorze générations.  **\n\nCette Ecriture retrace l'histoire terrestre de la naissance de Jésus-Christ à Abraham, parce qu'il a été promis à Abraham la semence par laquelle les familles de la terre seraient bénies. Ils ont pu retracer Jésus jusqu'à Abraham parce que leurs registres de naissance étaient précis et bien tenus. Ils l'ont retracé jusqu'à David aussi parce que le Seigneur avait promis à David   « Je te donnerai un fils qui sera assis sur ton trône pour toujours. Jésus a été retracé jusqu'à Adam par qui la semence de la femme devait venir, pour montrer qu'il est un Fils de la foi, un Fils de la promesse.  **\nD'après les annales, chaque Israélite comprendrait que c'est le Messie que le Seigneur avait promis. Il est le Roi que Dieu a promis de venir. Une bonne tenue des registres aide à effacer la confusion parmi le peuple de Dieu. Le diable ne saura pas comment entrer. Il ne saura pas fabriquer des mensonges ou déformer les faits. Quand il fera le sien, nous le saurons clairement car ce ne sera pas en harmonie avec les annales de Dieu.    **\n1.5 Le récit des miracles et des œuvres de Dieu renforce la foi des gens  **\nJean 6 verset 1 à 14  **\n1 Après ces choses, Jésus passa la mer de Galilée, qui est la mer de Tibériade. 2 Et une grande foule le suivit, parce qu'ils voyaient ses miracles qu'il faisait sur les malades.\n3 Et Jésus monta sur une montagne, et là il s'assit avec ses disciples. 4 Et la Pâque, fête des Juifs, était proche.\n5 Lorsque Jésus leva alors les yeux, et qu'il vit une grande foule venir à lui, il dit à Philippe   D'où achèterons-nous du pain, pour que ceux-ci mangent ?\n6 Et il dit cela pour l'éprouver, car lui-même savait ce qu'il ferait. 7 Philippe lui répondit  Deux cents deniers de pain ne leur suffisent pas, pour que chacun en prenne un peu. 8 L'un de ses disciples, André, frère de Simon-Pierre, lui dit   9 Il y a ici un garçon qui a cinq pains d'orge et deux petits poissons ; mais que sont-ils parmi tant d'autres ?\n10 Et Jésus dit   Faites asseoir les hommes. Maintenant, il y avait beaucoup d'herbe dans la place. Les hommes s'assirent donc, au nombre d'environ cinq mille.\n11 Et Jésus prit les pains ; et après avoir rendu grâces, il distribua aux disciples, et les disciples à ceux qui étaient assis; et de même des poissons autant qu'ils le voudraient.\n12 Quand ils furent remplis, il dit à ses disciples   Ramassez les morceaux qui restent, afin que rien ne soit perdu.\n13 Ils les rassemblèrent donc et remplirent douze paniers avec les fragments des cinq pains d'orge qui restaient en plus à ceux qui avaient mangé.\n14 Alors ces hommes, après avoir vu le miracle que Jésus avait fait, dirent   C'est vraiment le prophète qui doit venir dans le monde.  **\nVoyez l'effort qu'il aurait fallu pour compter ces 5000 hommes ! Pourtant, ils avaient besoin du nombre, car cela aiderait à montrer clairement la gloire de Jésus. Beaucoup de choses ont été faites parmi nous, mais nous n'y avons pas prêté l'attention voulue. Nous ne les avons pas enregistrés, alors ils sont simplement décédés. Certains opposants peuvent dire   « Montrez-nous la présence de Dieu parmi vous ; où sont les miracles de Dieu parmi vous ? Il y en a beaucoup, mais ils ne sont pas enregistrés. Le Seigneur a commandé aux disciples de rassembler les fragments dans des paniers, et ils s'élevaient à 12 paniers ! Merveilleux résultat de tenue de registres! Maintenant, combien de pains ? Cinq pains. Combien de poissons ? Deux poissons. Combien de personnes en ont mangé ? 5000 personnes, en dehors des femmes et des enfants, qui ont aussi mangé. Au total, il devrait y avoir environ dix mille personnes.   **\nEnsuite, les restes ou fragments qui restaient, qui ont été rassemblés étaient douze paniers. C'était vraiment un miracle ! Quand les gens virent cela, leurs yeux s'ouvrirent davantage pour savoir que Jésus était vraiment Celui qui devait venir. Ainsi, lorsque les gens entendront ou liront le récit de ce que vous faites, de ce que Dieu a fait, ils s'étonneront et croiront.  **\n1.6 La tenue de registres des événements favorise le travail du ministère  **\nChaque ministère chrétien devrait avoir un registre de ses événements, programmes et activités pour que les autres puissent le voir. Par exemple, combien de messages le directeur international du mouvement de réveil de la sainteté a-t-il prêchés à ce jour ? Nous avons besoin de tels enregistrements. Combien de pays a-t-il visité jusqu'à présent ? Est-ce par son pouvoir ? Nous avons besoin du dossier. Au cours de ses voyages missionnaires, combien de personnes ont assisté à ses croisades ou conférences de ministres ? Combien de conversions ont été faites ? Ce sont des statistiques vitales. Dieu s'intéresse à ces archives.  ** \nIl existe d'autres registres d'événements qu'une église doit conserver, tels que   la présence au service du dimanche ; participation à l'étude biblique; participation aux réunions de chapitre ou d'unité et messages prêchés. En analysant les messages, nous serons en mesure de connaître les domaines d'intérêt et les domaines de négligence. En enregistrant les messages sur CD/DVD, vous serez en mesure de connaître un large éventail de messages qui couvrent divers sujets de la vie et du ministère chrétiens. Vous saurez ceux à écouter et ceux que vous devriez écouter.  **\n1.7 Le Ciel tient un registre des activités quotidiennes des hommes sur Terre  **\nApocalypse 20 verset 11 à 15  **\n11 Et je vis un grand trône blanc, et celui qui était assis dessus, devant la face duquel la terre et le ciel s'enfuirent ; et il n'y a pas eu de place pour eux.\n12 Et je vis les morts, petits et grands, debout devant Dieu ; et les livres furent ouverts et un autre livre fut ouvert, qui est le livre de vie , et les morts furent jugés d'après les choses qui étaient écrites dans les livres, selon leurs oeuvres. 13 Et la mer rendit les morts qui s'y trouvaient; et la mort et la géhenne livrèrent les morts qui étaient en eux, et chacun fut jugé selon ses oeuvres. 14 Et la mort et l'enfer furent jetés dans l'étang de feu. C'est le second décès.\n15 Et quiconque ne fut pas trouvé écrit dans le livre de vie fut jeté dans l'étang de feu.  **\nIci, nous voyons que des registres ont été ouverts comme témoignage contre les pécheurs. Sans ceux-ci, il aurait été difficile de suivre et de trouver des détails sur la vie d'individus qui auraient fait valoir que leurs noms sont dans le livre de vie à cause de leurs œuvres. Tout aurait été embrouillé, rendant les choses difficiles le jour du jugement. S'inspirant de ce modèle céleste, c'est le livre des records qui nous aide dans le ministère à vérifier si quelqu'un est vraiment digne d'être promu. Nous voulons savoir comment a été la vie d'un travailleur et promouvoir ceux qui ont été fidèles et dignes de promotion. Il peut y avoir des gens qui semblent bien aujourd'hui mais avec un mauvais passé. Nous devrons peut-être vérifier dans les registres pour savoir s'ils se sont vraiment repentis.  **\nLa tenue de registres est requise dans les statistiques, les finances, les dîmes et les offrandes, et la participation aux réunions. Nous avons besoin de détails sur le montant d'argent qui entre sous forme de dîmes et d'offrandes, combien de personnes ont assisté à la réunion, combien d'hommes, de femmes et d'enfants, combien de visiteurs, quels messages ont été écoutés et combien se sont convertis. Dieu a besoin de tous ces détails.  **\n1.8 Enregistrement des actifs  **\nLa tenue de registres aide à rendre des comptes, ce qui fait partie d'une vie sainte. Des registres appropriés doivent être conservés dans tous les domaines du ministère. Par exemple, le département des médias doit conserver des enregistrements du nombre de messages qui ont été prêchés au cours d'une période donnée. Il devrait y avoir un enregistrement et une conservation des CD/DVD maîtres en cas de perte ou d'accident, afin qu'il y ait une sauvegarde pour reproduire de nouvelles copies. Dans ce cas, le diable ne réussira pas à effacer certains des messages prêchés et enregistrés.  **\nUn autre domaine important de la tenue de registres concerne les actifs de l'église. Tous les biens achetés par l'église doivent être enregistrés dans le registre des biens. Cet enregistrement indiquera la date d'achat, la description de l'actif, le nombre d'unités achetées, le prix et l'état de l'actif (qu'il soit en excellent, bon ou passable état). Ce registre sera régulièrement mis à jour pour fournir des informations à jour sur l'état des biens de l'église, ce qui permet de vérifier les abus, les détournements et les vols. Par exemple, un rapport a été reçu au sujet d'un de nos ex-coordinateurs du mouvement de réveil de la sainteté qui a converti un véhicule donné au ministère à un usage personnel. Il a signé tous les documents de transfert sans faire intervenir d'autres dirigeants du ministère. Lorsqu'il partait, personne n'était au courant de l'existence du véhicule et il l'a emporté. Si, toutefois, la pratique de l'enregistrement des actifs avait été cultivée, il était probable que le véhicule aurait été immatriculé au nom du ministère et une telle conversion des biens du ministère en propriété personnelle aurait été évitée. Que chaque actif qui entre pour le ministère soit enregistré rapidement et correctement afin de ne pas créer un environnement propice aux mauvais travailleurs.  **\nParfois, l'actif peut être une propriété foncière. Si le coordinateur est le seul au courant de la donation d'un bien foncier au Ministère, il peut être tenté de le convertir en son bien personnel. Inutile de dire qu'une telle situation affecte la sainteté du croyant et donnera lieu à un jugement divin dans le futur à moins que la restitution ne soit faite. Par conséquent, tenez un registre adéquat de tous les actifs (bâtiments, machines, véhicules, équipements, etc.). Tenir un registre détaillé de tous les actifs du ministère est une panacée contre le vol et le pillage. De plus, à moins que nous ne gardions un tel registre, comment savons-nous combien Dieu a béni le Ministère ?  **\nDe même, une tenue de registres appropriée doit être maintenue pour chaque projet de l'église, comme la construction de bâtiments, l'achat de terrains ou de bâtiments, les salaires et indemnités, les réparations ou la vente d'actifs. Les campagnes d'évangélisation doivent être bien documentées pour s'assurer que l'argent de Dieu est utilisé judicieusement. Les personnes employées au service de Dieu doivent être d'une intégrité avérée ; et même ceux-ci doivent être correctement surveillés.  **\nRomains 12 verset 11, 17  **\n11 Pas paresseux dans les affaires ; fervent d'esprit; servir le Seigneur; 17 Ne rendez à personne le mal pour le mal. Fournir des choses honnêtes aux yeux de tous les hommes.\n2 Corinthiens 8 verset 18 à 22  **\n18 Et nous avons envoyé avec lui le frère, dont la louange est dans l'Évangile dans toutes les Églises;\n19 Et pas seulement cela, mais qui a aussi été choisi parmi les églises pour voyager avec nous avec cette grâce, qui est administrée par nous à la gloire du même Seigneur, et déclaration de votre bon sens  \n20 Evitant cela, afin que personne ne nous blâme dans cette abondance que nous administrons; 21 Pourvoir aux choses honnêtes, non seulement devant le Seigneur, mais aussi devant les hommes.\n22 Et nous avons envoyé avec eux notre frère, que nous avons souvent montré diligent en beaucoup de choses, mais maintenant beaucoup plus diligent, sur la grande confiance que j'ai en vous.  **\nCHAPITRE 2  **\nLA TENUE DES DOSSIERS FAIT PARTIE DU PERFECTIONNEMENT DE LA SAINTETE DANS LE MINISTERE  **\n2.1 Où Satan a eu Judas  **\nNous bénissons Dieu que parmi tous les disciples de Jésus, nous n'avons pas entendu dire qu'il y avait quelqu'un pris en flagrant délit de fornication ou d'adultère. Sous la stricte surveillance de Jésus, ils ont pu se préserver à ces égards. Le péché qui a complètement vaincu l'un des disciples était l'amour de l'argent. Judas est tombé amoureux de l'argent. Alors que les onze disciples restants ne le savaient probablement pas, son état de rétrograde n'était pas caché à Jésus. Satan n'a pas eu Judas dans l'immoralité, mais il l'a eu dans le domaine de l'argent. De la même manière, beaucoup de nos frères peuvent être très propres dans leur relation avec le sexe opposé et complètement exempts d'alcoolisme, mais pas d'argent corrompu. L'argent est leur maître ! Certains peuvent être conscients de cette faiblesse tandis que d'autres ne le peuvent pas, à cause de leur cœur trompeur.  **\nJérémie 17 verset 9 à 11  **\n9 Le cœur est trompeur par-dessus tout, et désespérément méchant, qui peut le savoir ?\n10 Moi, l'Éternel, je sonde les coeurs, j'éprouve les reins, pour rendre à chacun selon ses voies et selon le fruit de ses actions.\n11 Comme la perdrix est assise sur des oeufs, et ne les couve pas; ainsi celui qui acquiert des richesses, et non par droit, les quittera au milieu de ses jours, et à sa fin sera un insensé.  **\n2. 2 Révélation sur un mouvement de réveil du personnel de la sainteté impliqué dans des irrégularités financières  **\nUn membre du personnel du siège du Holiness Revival Movement, à Abuja, au Nigeria, a raconté une révélation qu'il a eue. Il avait auparavant collecté de l'argent pour commander du matériel à l'étranger à utiliser dans le département des médias. Il a versé l'argent sur son compte pour lui permettre d'effectuer un paiement en ligne. Il n'a pas pu conclure un accord avec les fournisseurs pour lui permettre d'effectuer un paiement immédiat, il a donc laissé l'argent sur son compte dans l'espoir de poursuivre la négociation à une date ultérieure. Jésus est venu à lui dans une révélation après que l'argent soit resté avec lui pendant trois mois. Dans la révélation, il s'est vu passer un examen avec quelques personnes, mais ce qui l'a surpris, c'est qu'il n'a pas écrit son nom sur sa feuille de réponses. Il y a écrit le nom de quelqu'un d'autre ! Il ne s'est rendu compte de cette erreur qu'après avoir fini d'écrire l'examen et que le surveillant est venu chercher son texte de réponse. Il a supplié le surveillant de lui permettre d'écrire son propre nom sur le script de réponse, mais le surveillant a refusé en disant   \"Vous avez déjà terminé et soumis, vous ne pouvez donc plus rien modifier.\" Après cela, il se trouva devant une porte de la salle où ils passaient l'examen. Lorsqu'un candidat se présente à la porte, la porte s'ouvrira automatiquement pour lui s'il réussit l'examen. Sinon, la porte resterait fermée. Il a vu beaucoup de gens rassemblés à la porte qui n'ont pas réussi leur examen.  **\nÀ ce moment-là, le Seigneur vint à lui et lui dit  \n« Vous voyez ces gens ? Ils n'ont pas réussi leur examen, et même vous, vous n'avez pas réussi votre examen. La raison pour laquelle vous avez écrit le nom d'un autre homme sur votre papier est que quelqu'un d'autre prendra votre place et héritera de votre récompense. Vous travaillez maintenant pour quelqu'un d'autre parce que vous n'avez pas réussi votre examen.  **\nPourquoi n'avez-vous pas réussi votre examen ? C'est parce qu'il y a certaines petites choses que vous faites qui sont devenues des obstacles à votre succès. Ces foules de gens que vous voyez à la porte sont aussi des croyants. Ce sont des leaders, mais eux aussi n'ont pas réussi leurs examens à cause de ces petites choses. C'est pourquoi la porte ne s'est pas aussi ouverte pour eux. Cela nécessitera une restitution. Ils doivent revenir pour faire la restitution et se nettoyer avant que la porte ne s'ouvre pour qu'ils puissent passer. Quant à vous, Mon argent est avec vous. Vous avez gardé Mon argent sur votre compte personnel. T'appartient-il? Mon argent est sur votre compte depuis maintenant trois mois. C'est le vôtre ? Le frère répondit   « Ah ! Mais je pense toujours à acheter les articles. Jésus répondit   « Tu réfléchis encore ?    **\nEt si vous étiez tombé et mouriez ? Votre vie est-elle entre vos mains ? Si tu étais tombé et que tu étais mort, qui aurait su que Mon argent était sur ton compte ? Ce serait parti ! Renvoyez cet argent au bureau. De plus, il y a de l'argent qui est resté en monnaie dans ta main quand tu as acheté des choses pour Mon ministère mais tu les as gardées pour toi et tu les as dépensées comme si elles t'appartenaient. Ma monnaie qui vous reste est Mon argent, mais vous les avez utilisés pour vous-même. Ce sont les choses qui vous ont fait échouer à votre examen et la porte ne s'ouvrirait pas pour vous.  **\nComme vous pouvez le voir, Jésus n'a pas réprimandé ce jeune homme pour son immoralité. Pas du tout! Était-il fervent dans la prière ? Oui! Était-il engagé dans les choses de Dieu ? Oui! Était-il un merveilleux prédicateur ? Oui, mais pas de paradis ! Très subtilement et doucement, le diable l'a poussé et a continué à pousser jusqu'à ce que son nom soit effacé du livre de vie. Son nom n'y était plus ! C'est de la même manière que Satan a eu Judas. Par conséquent, frère chrétien, sœur chrétienne, soyez prudents !  **\nHébreux 4 verset 1  **\ncraignons donc que, la promesse nous étant faite d'entrer dans son repos, l'un d'entre vous ne semble en manquer.  **\nPremier Pierre 1 verset 17  **\nAfin que l'épreuve de votre foi, bien plus précieuse que l'or qui périt, même éprouvée par le feu, soit trouvée pour la louange, l'honneur et la gloire à l'apparition de Jésus-Christ.  **\nHébreux 9 verset 31  **\nC'est une chose effrayante de tomber entre les mains du Dieu vivant.  **\nAlors que vous travaillez avec ferveur pour Dieu, vérifiez sur vous-même pour vous assurer que vous ne manquerez pas et ne serez pas condamné, et rejeté le dernier jour. Utilisez le modèle de l'apôtre Paul dans votre ministère et travaillez pour Dieu.  **\n 1 Corinthiens 9 verset 26 à 27  **\n26 Je cours donc ainsi, non pas avec incertitude ; ainsi combats-je, non comme celui qui bat l'air ; 27 Mais je garde sous mon corps, et je le soumets; de peur qu'en aucun cas, après avoir prêché aux autres, je ne sois moi-même un naufragé.  **\n2.3 Judas était un voleur  **\nJean 12 verset 1 à 8  **\n1 Alors Jésus, six jours avant la Pâque, vint à Béthanie, où était Lazare, qui était mort, qu'il a ressuscité des morts.\n2 Là, ils lui firent un souper; et Marthe servait, mais Lazare était l'un d'entre eux qui étaient assis à table avec lui.\n3 Marie prit alors une livre d'un parfum de nard, très précieux, et oignit les pieds de Jésus, et lui essuya les pieds avec ses cheveux, et la maison fut remplie de l'odeur du parfum.\n4 Alors dit l'un de ses disciples, Judas Iscariote, fils de Simon, qui devait le livrer,\n5 Pourquoi ce parfum n'a-t-il pas été vendu trois cents deniers et donné aux pauvres ?\n6 Il dit cela, non qu'il se souciât des pauvres ; mais parce qu'il était un voleur, et qu'il avait le sac, et qu'il avait découvert ce qui y était mis.\n7 Alors Jésus dit   Laisse-la, jusqu'au jour de mon enterrement elle a gardé ceci. 8 Car vous avez toujours des pauvres avec vous; mais vous ne m'avez pas toujours.  **\nDe cette écriture, nous pouvons voir que le raisonnement de Judas était corrompu parce qu'il était lui-même corrompu. Il est évident qu'il avait converti l'argent du ministère en usage personnel dans le passé, car le verset six dit  «Ce qu'il a dit, non pas qu'il se souciait des pauvres; mais parce qu'il était un voleur, qu'il avait le sac et qu'il avait mis à nu ce qu'il y avait dedans. Le motif de son désaccord avec ce que Mary a fait était que, si le pétrole cher était vendu et que l'argent était apporté dans la bourse, il aurait plus d'argent à voler. Il voulait que l'argent coule d'une manière qu'il lui serait facile de voler sans que personne ne le sache. De telles personnes résisteraient toujours à l'œuvre essentielle de Dieu si elle ne pouvait pas être exécutée d'une manière qui leur serait profitable. Ils seront toujours en désaccord en disant   « Non, non, non, pourquoi mettez-vous de l'argent là-bas ? Nous avons besoin d'argent ici. Tout cela pour leur donner l'opportunité d'aller derrière et de siphonner l'argent sans que personne ne le sache. Pourquoi était -il en colère ? Pourquoi discutait-il avec Jésus ? Judas a dû réussir à influencer les autres disciples par sa conviction corrompue, car leur réaction n'a pas été différente lorsqu'un scénario similaire s'est déroulé dans la maison de Simon le lépreux.   **\nMatthieu 26 verset 6 à 10  **\n6 Lorsque Jésus était à Béthanie, dans la maison de Simon le lépreux,\n7 Une femme vint à lui, ayant une boîte d'albâtre contenant un parfum très précieux, et la versa sur sa tête, pendant qu'il était à table.\n8 Mais quand ses disciples virent cela, ils furent indignés, disant   A quoi sert ce gaspillage ?\n9 Car ce parfum aurait pu être vendu beaucoup, et donné aux pauvres.\n10 Jésus, l'ayant compris, leur dit   Pourquoi troublez-vous la femme ? car elle a fait une bonne œuvre sur moi. 11 Car vous avez toujours des pauvres avec vous ; mais vous ne m'avez pas toujours.\n12 Car en ce qu'elle a répandu ce parfum sur mon corps, elle l'a fait pour ma sépulture.\n13 En vérité, je vous le dis, partout où cet évangile sera prêché dans le monde entier, là aussi ce que cette femme a fait sera raconté en mémoire d'elle.  **\nJudas a travaillé sur eux mais ils n'ont pas compris son motif. Jésus leur a expliqué   « C'est le domaine prioritaire, pas ce que vous avez en tête. Ils utilisent cet argent sur Moi et vous ne M'avez pas toujours. Quant à l'autre chose dont vous parlez, l'opportunité de le faire sera toujours là. Judas a dit   « Non, non, allons-y pour l'autre, celui que vous avez en tête pourra apparaître plus tard. Parce que Judas avait la bourse et qu'il s'en tirait, il a vu l'opportunité de voler beaucoup d'argent - trois cents pence ! Quelle belle somme à cette époque ! En tant que trésorier, il avait le dernier mot parce que Jésus ne le harcelait pas. Pas de comité de vérification ni d'autorité approbatrice ! Et tout viendra à lui finalement. Le cas de Judas nous enseigne ici une leçon. Qu'il y ait des freins et contrepoids entre frères pour décourager le détournement de fonds et la fraude.  **\n2.4 Certaines personnes sont au service de Dieu pour des arrière-pensées  **\nJean 6 verset 66 à 71  **\n66 A partir de ce moment-là, plusieurs de ses disciples s'en retournèrent et ne marchèrent plus avec lui.\n67 Alors Jésus dit aux douze   Voulez-vous aussi vous en aller ?\n68 Alors Simon Pierre lui répondit   Seigneur, à qui irions-nous ? tu as les paroles de la vie éternelle.\n69 Et nous croyons et sommes sûrs que tu es ce Christ, le Fils du Dieu vivant.  **\nBeaucoup de disciples de Jésus se retournaient parce qu'ils estimaient que Jésus était trop dur. Le Seigneur a demandé aux disciples s'ils voulaient eux aussi s'en aller. Ils ont répondu   « Comment pouvons-nous partir ? Vers qui irions-nous ? Comme certains diraient aussi   « Comment quittons-nous le Holiness Revival Movement ? C'est ici que nous avons trouvé la parole de Dieu. C'est ici que nos yeux se sont ouverts. C'est ici que nous avons connu la vérité et que nous sommes sûrs d'aller au ciel. Ils ont dit à Jésus   « Nous savons que tu es le Fils de Dieu et que tu as les paroles de la vie éternelle. Où allons-nous encore ? A combien Jésus s'est-il adressé ? Combien ont répondu ? Bien que Pierre parlait au nom des autres, Judas avait une autre raison pour laquelle il restait. Au lieu de la vie éternelle, son intérêt était différent. Au lieu de la vie éternelle, une autre raison l'y retenait. Nous avons pu le voir à partir de la réponse de Jésus qui a suivi.  **\nJean 6 verset 70 à 71  **\n70 Jésus leur répondit   Ne vous ai-je pas choisis douze, et l'un de vous est un démon ?\n71 Il parla de Judas Iscariote, fils de Simon, car c'était lui qui devait le trahir, étant l'un des douze.  **\nPourquoi ce démon est-il resté ? Était-ce pour la vie éternelle ? Il y a un avantage qu'il gagne dans ce ministère, en tant que disciple de Jésus. Alors que les disciples disaient   \"Où puis-je trouver la parole de Dieu si pure que celle-ci, que nous puissions manger si librement et avoir la vie éternelle si clairement placée devant nous\", Judas disait   \"Où puis-je obtenir de l'argent bon marché comme encore une fois, où personne ne me contrôle ? » Tout l'argent est dans ma main et je peux construire des maisons, acheter n'importe quoi et même faire preuve de gentillesse envers les gens pour donner l'impression d'une vie sainte ! Judas avec Jésus est resté pour une raison différente.  **\nCela nous dit que, aussi saints que nous soyons dans ce ministère, nous avons encore des gens douteux. Quant à Jésus, il y avait une raison pour laquelle il a donné carte blanche à Judas. Mais pour nous, nous ne pouvons pas nous permettre de le faire ; sinon, le peu d'argent que nous avons à gérer disparaîtra du jour au lendemain et l'œuvre de Dieu s'arrêtera. Une personne aventureuse viendra juste tout nettoyer. Ce sont des gens injustes qui exécutent l'agenda du diable. S'ils ne sont pas contrôlés, ils étoufferont le travail et frustreront nos ambitions et nos projets évangéliques.    **\n2.5 Qu'est-ce que certaines personnes ne feront pas pour de l'argent ?  **\nDans une école mixte de garçons et de filles, les enseignants de service font le tour pour vérifier les élèves dans le foyer pour s'assurer que les élèves ne franchissent pas les frontières et ne passent pas d'un foyer pour femmes à un foyer pour hommes et vice versa. Parfois, ils font leur vérification en pleine nuit. Bien que les auberges soient séparées et bien délimitées, vous ne pouvez pas exclure que des étudiants aventureux brisent les barrières pour commettre l'immoralité. De la même manière, il est nécessaire de travailler constamment sur les dirigeants et les travailleurs du ministère pour les contrôler ; sinon, il y aura des fuites financières dans le système et le travail du ministère subira de sérieux revers.  **\nMatthieu 26 verset 14 à 16  **\n14 Alors l'un des douze, appelé Judas Iscariote, alla vers les principaux sacrificateurs,\n15 Et leur dit   Que me donnerez-vous, et je vous le livrerai ? Et ils firent alliance avec lui pour trente pièces d'argent.\n16 Et dès lors il chercha l'occasion de le trahir.  **\nJésus avait vécu avec Judas pendant environ trois ans et demi. Il était innocent, parfait, un faiseur de miracles, un homme bon, un bon enseignant et un bon consolateur et il avait la gloire de Dieu sur lui. Pourtant, voyez ce que Judas a fait ! Qu'est-ce que ces gens ne peuvent pas faire pour de l'argent ? Qui est le directeur international du mouvement de réveil de la sainteté qu'ils ne peuvent pas mépriser en matière d'argent ? Qui est celui contre qui ils ne peuvent pas mentir pour l'argent ? Imaginez Judas ! Il a conclu un accord diabolique pour trahir son Seigneur et Maître et le faire tuer pour un jeton de trente pièces d'argent, qui est le prix d'un esclave en Israël !  **\nDans le monde séculier, ils vendent des êtres humains pour de l'argent. Ils achètent des bébés et les écrasent au mortier pour de l'argent rituel. Ils coupaient la tête des gens pour de l'argent rituel. Même dans le ministère chrétien, l'argent conduit toujours les gens à faire de grands maux ! Ils se mettent en colère lorsqu'un projecteur est braqué sur eux parce qu'ils n'aiment pas faire l'objet d'une enquête. Pourquoi quelqu'un aurait-il peur d'une enquête si ses mains sont propres ? Parfois, ils veulent montrer un peu de spiritualité et prononcer des mots doux comme   « Frère, c'est Dieu qui nous a aidés. En fait, ce paradis, nous devons être là. En entendant ces mots doux, vous le regarderez comme un homme parfait et saint. Mais c'est un stratagème pour détourner votre attention de lui afin qu'il puisse continuer ses mauvaises actions. De votre côté, vous ne devez pas tomber dans ce piège ; vous devriez plutôt suivre la vérité et faire ce qui est juste pour protéger le ministère de Jésus. Qu'il soit dit de toi que tu as accompli toute justice.  **\n2.6 Enlevez vos yeux de l'argent de Dieu  **\nL'amour de l'argent est la chute de nombreux ministres de Dieu. Satan a obtenu Judas grâce à l'argent et son offense était grande en tant que traître de Jésus. Aujourd'hui, de nombreux croyants et ministres de Dieu tombent sous le pouvoir de l'argent. Satan est entré dans leur vie et a capturé leur âme à travers l'argent.  **\nPremier Timothée 6 verset 6 à 12  **\n6 Mais la piété avec contentement est un grand gain.\n7 Car nous n'avons rien apporté dans ce monde, et il est certain que nous ne pouvons rien emporter.\n8 Et ayant de la nourriture et des vêtements, soyons satisfaits de cela.\n9 Mais ceux qui veulent devenir riches tombent dans la tentation et dans un piège, et dans beaucoup de convoitises folles et nuisibles, qui noient les hommes dans la destruction et la perdition.\n10 Car l'amour de l'argent est la racine de tout mal   que certains convoitaient, ils ont égaré la foi et se sont percés de beaucoup de douleurs.\n11 Mais toi, homme de Dieu, fuis ces choses ; et recherchez la justice, la piété, la foi, l'amour, la patience, la douceur.\n12 Combats le bon combat de la foi, saisis la vie éternelle, à laquelle tu es aussi appelé, et tu as professé une bonne profession devant de nombreux témoins.  **\nL'argent a causé la chute de beaucoup, mais en tant qu'enfant de Dieu et en effet en tant qu'homme de Dieu, vous devez retirer l'amour de l'argent de votre cœur pour rester pur. Mais pourquoi cours-tu après l'argent ? Pour construire une maison ? Acheter une voiture ou faire quoi ? Savez-vous que la piété avec contentement est un grand gain ? Si vous n'avez pas d'argent pour payer les frais de scolarité de vos enfants, pourquoi ne pas mettre votre confiance dans le Seigneur, même si vos enfants devront être renvoyés de l'école à cause de votre justice ? Cela signifie-t-il que Dieu vous a abandonné ? Pendant la période d'un an que vos enfants resteront à la maison, si vous continuez tous à crier vers votre Père qui est aux cieux, n'entendra-t-il pas ? Dieu n'est- il plus au ciel ? N'appréciera-t-il pas votre justice ? Ne se lèvera-t-il pas et ne fera-t-il pas quelque chose pour honorer ses enfants ?  **\nLe Psalmiste dit, « J'ai été jeune, et maintenant je suis vieux ; pourtant je n'ai pas vu le juste abandonné, ni sa postérité mendiant du pain. Pourquoi ne pas aller devant Dieu avec foi et prier, plutôt que de recourir au vol pour payer les frais de scolarité de vos enfants ? Où est la bénédiction ? N'est-ce pas la bénédiction de l'Éternel qui « enrichit et n'ajoute pas de chagrin » ? N'êtes-vous pas en train de maudire vos enfants en bâtissant leur vie sur des fondations défectueuses ? N'est-ce pas une malédiction pour eux ? C'est toi, en tant que père, qui leur apportes la chose maudite, en volant l'argent de Dieu pour payer leurs frais de scolarité ? N'as-tu pas déjà mis la destruction sur leur chemin ? Certains d'entre eux peuvent mourir et ne jamais terminer l'école à cause du poids de vos péchés sur leur vie. Vous en faites des enfants du diable parce que vous les avez consacrés à Satan. C'est lui qui vous apprend comment obtenir de l'argent pour leurs frais de scolarité, ce sont donc ses enfants. Il les nourrit de poison et finira par les revendiquer. C'est pourquoi, enfant de Dieu, fuis ces choses et maintiens la justice. Enlevez vos yeux de l'argent de Dieu. Ne le cherchez pas.  **\nRomains 2 verset 21  **\nToi donc qui enseignes un autre, ne t'enseignes-tu pas toi-même ? toi qui prêches qu'un homme ne doit pas voler, voles-tu?  **\nDans la fonction publique, il est courant que les gens inventent des moyens de détourner l'argent du gouvernement. Ils ont maîtrisé les divers arts de concevoir des moyens de siphonner de l'argent. Ils obtiendraient une approbation et réclameraient une indemnité pour les cours auxquels ils n'ont pas participé parce qu'ils sont plus intéressés par l'argent que par le renforcement des capacités, ce qui les rendrait plus productifs pour le gouvernement. Ils apportent de fausses factures et de faux reçus pour réclamer de l'argent pour des articles de papeterie et des biens qu'ils n'ont jamais achetés. Lorsqu'ils achètent quelque chose, ils gonflent le prix sur le reçu afin de gagner de l'argent supplémentaire pour eux-mêmes. Ils ne retournent pas l'argent restant dans les bourses du gouvernement ; cela devient le leur. Ils convertissent les actifs du gouvernement en leurs propres biens et les ramènent chez eux. Vous ne devez pas apporter ce mal à l'église. Jamais! Soyez sincère et vrai dans toutes vos relations, que quelqu'un vous voie ou non. Rappelez-vous qu'il y a un Dieu dans le ciel qui veille sur vos activités sur terre.  **\nPremier Timothée 6 verset 6 à 9  **\n6 Mais la piété avec contentement est un grand gain. 7 Car nous n'avons rien apporté dans ce monde, et il est certain que nous ne pouvons rien emporter.\n8 Et ayant de la nourriture et des vêtements, soyons satisfaits de cela.\n9 Mais ceux qui veulent devenir riches tombent dans la tentation et dans un piège, et dans beaucoup de convoitises folles et nuisibles, qui noient les hommes dans la destruction et la perdition.  **\nLuc 12 verset 15, 19 à 20  **\n15 Et il leur dit   Prenez garde, et gardez-vous de la convoitise, car la vie d'un homme ne consiste pas dans l'abondance des choses qu'il possède.\n19 Et je dirai à mon âme   Âme, tu as beaucoup de biens amassés pour plusieurs années ; repose-toi, mange, bois et réjouis-toi.\n20 Mais Dieu lui dit   Insensé, cette nuit ton âme te sera redemandée ; alors à qui seront ces choses que tu as pourvues ?  **\nCHAPITRE 3  **\nLE BESOIN DE DILIGENCE ET DE VIGILANCE DANS LE MINISTERE  **\nLes dirigeants et les ministres de l'église doivent être diligents et attentifs à l'héritage de Dieu dans le ministère. Cela comprend à la fois les possessions humaines et matérielles du Seigneur. En tant que dirigeants, nous supposons souvent que lorsque les gens disent qu'ils sont nés de nouveau, on peut leur faire confiance et leur confier des responsabilités sans qu'il soit nécessaire de les contrôler. Cette confiance peut parfois être mal placée. Il n'y a que Dieu qui connaît le cœur de l'homme.  **\nJérémie 17 verset 9 à 10  **\n9 Le cœur est trompeur par-dessus tout, et désespérément méchant, qui peut le savoir ? 10 Moi, l'Éternel, je sonde les coeurs, j'éprouve les reins, pour rendre à chacun selon ses voies et selon le fruit de ses actions.  **\nC'est la raison pour laquelle Jésus ne s'est pas engagé envers les hommes parce qu'il connaissait tous les hommes.  **\nJean 2 verset 22 à 25  **\n22 C'est pourquoi, lorsqu'il fut ressuscité des morts, ses disciples se souvinrent qu'il leur avait dit cela; et ils crurent à l'Écriture et à la parole que Jésus avait dite.\n23 Lorsqu'il était à Jérusalem à la Pâque, le jour de la fête, plusieurs crurent en son nom, lorsqu'ils virent les miracles qu'il faisait.\n24 Mais Jésus ne s'est pas confié à eux, parce qu'il connaissait tous les hommes,\n25 Et il n'était pas nécessaire que quelqu'un rende témoignage de l'homme, car il savait ce qu'il y avait dans l'homme. Nous devons apprendre du Maître et être prudents.  **\nCe chapitre se concentre sur certaines études de cas d'événements pratiques dans des églises et d'autres lieux d'apprentissage, afin que les dirigeants puissent devenir plus vigilants et assurer une bonne tenue des dossiers dans le ministère.  **\n3.1 Étude de cas d'un événement dans une église que j'ai été pasteur  **\nAvant de devenir directeur international du Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, j'avais été pasteur de nombreuses églises de l'église biblique Deeper Life à différents niveaux d'autorité. Dans l'une des églises que j'ai été pasteur, il est arrivé qu'un jour fatidique pendant le service du dimanche, les dîmes et les offrandes aient été collectées par les huissiers et j'ai également laissé tomber les miens.  **\nAprès le service, nous avions besoin d'acheter quelque chose pour l'église, alors j'ai demandé les dîmes et les offrandes. À ma plus grande surprise, le montant total qu'ils prétendaient avoir collecté correspondait à peu près à la dîme que j'avais payée. Plus choquant était le fait qu'un autre frère a dit qu'il avait payé une dîme qui était encore plus élevée que la mienne. J'étais abasourdi. J'ai appelé tous les huissiers ensemble et quand j'ai regardé leurs visages, ils avaient tous l'air très innocents. J'ai demandé   « Que s'est-il passé ? Un huissier a dit une chose et l'autre a dit une autre chose. J'ai dit  \"Ainsi, avec tous les messages que j'ai prêchés, nous avons encore Judas ici?\" Fort de cette expérience, je leur ai alors dit qu'à partir de là, ils ne devraient plus emporter les dîmes et les offrandes recueillies dans la salle intérieure pour les compter. Je leur ai demandé de les garder à mes côtés à la chaire après la collecte. Ma pensée était que, ce serait une solution au problème. Mais je me suis bien trompé ! Dans un autre service, nous étions en prière (après que les dîmes et les offrandes aient été collectées et déposées à côté de moi sur la chaire), mais soudain il y a eu une panne de courant qui a plongé l'auditorium dans l'obscurité totale. Il a fallu environ cinq à dix minutes avant que le générateur ne se déclenche et que la lumière ne soit rétablie. Étonnamment, nous avons découvert que l'un des sacs d'offrande (avec de l'argent dedans) avait disparu de l'endroit où il était conservé ! Nous l'avons trouvé à une certaine distance de l'endroit où il était conservé. Je pense que la soudaine restauration de la lumière a surpris l'huissier voleur et il a rapidement laissé tomber le sac d'offrande et s'est enfui. Encore une fois, nous avons demandé qui l'avait fait, mais personne n'a avoué. C'est ce que l'homme peut faire pour de l'argent !  **\nC'est la raison pour laquelle les dirigeants doivent être très vigilants. \"Naître de nouveau\" n'est pas sur le visage, tout comme on dit \"le SIDA ne se voit pas sur le visage\". Que les huissiers et les personnes qui manipulent de l'argent soient éprouvés avant de les impliquer dans des affaires d'argent. Ces huissiers voleurs n'étaient pas de nouveaux convertis, donc cela ne dépend pas du temps que les gens ont passé dans l'église. C'est une question d'intégrité personnelle.  **\nProverbes 27 verset 22 à 23  **\n22 Même si tu braies un sot dans un mortier au milieu du froment avec un pilon, sa folie ne s'éloignera pas de lui.\n23 Sois attentif à connaître l'état de tes troupeaux, et prends soin de tes troupeaux.  **\n3.2 Cas d'une huissière voleuse dans une église  **\nIl y avait cette huissière âgée dans une église en Sierra-Leone. C'était une travailleuse de confiance, mais personne ne savait qu'elle volait dans le sac d'offrandes. Au fil du temps, elle s'est convertie au Holiness Revival Movement (HOREMOW) et a été condamnée. C'est alors que la vérité éclata. Elle a dû aller voir la direction de l'église pour se confesser et faire sa restitution. Elle a montré un bâtiment et a dit  «Ce bâtiment que vous voyez debout là, je l'ai construit avec l'argent des offrandes de l'église. C'est maintenant pour l'église. Je l'ai construit avec les dîmes volées et les offrandes de l'Église.  **\nEzéchiel 3 verset 17  **\nFils d'homme, je t'ai établi sentinelle pour la maison d'Israël. C'est pourquoi, écoute la parole de ma bouche, et avertis-les de ma part.  **\nVeille sur toutes choses ! C'est pourquoi le Seigneur vous a élevé en tant que dirigeant et auditeur d'église et en tant que gardien de Son œuvre. Il ne faut pas se taire mais crier. Ces personnes que vous voyez avoir l'air innocentes peuvent aller dans le sens contraire. Vérifiez-les pour vous assurer que le péché d'Acan en eux ne devienne pas une pierre d'achoppement au progrès de l'église. Vérifiez ces huissiers. Adoptez des procédures comptables qui garantiront qu'une personne n'est pas autorisée à compter l'argent seule, même s'il s'agit d'une personne de confiance. Mettez deux ou trois personnes en charge du comptage des offrandes sous bonne surveillance. Faites savoir que vous avez fait de votre mieux pour contrôler les abus.  **\nNe permettez à personne de vous cajoler avec des mots doux comme   « Ah mon frère, est-ce que tu me soupçonnes ? Par la grâce de Dieu, j'ai été converti en 1975 et depuis ce temps, j'ai été cohérent avec le Seigneur ; donc tu dois savoir que je ne peux pas être infidèle. Si vous ne me connaissez pas, Dieu m'en est témoin. Oubliez cette langue ! Mettez ce langage de côté et dites   « Accomplissons toute justice, car deux valent mieux qu'un. Pour l'amour de la justice, Jésus a été baptisé. Deux personnes doivent compter l'offrande et l'enregistrer.   **\nProverbes 23 verset 12, 15, 16  **\n12 Applique ton coeur à l'instruction, et tes oreilles aux paroles de la connaissance.\n15 Mon fils, si ton cœur est sage, mon cœur se réjouira, même le mien.\n16 Oui, mes reins se réjouiront, quand tes lèvres prononcent des choses justes.  **\nNe prenez pas l'intégrité des gens pour acquise  **\nParfois, lors de la collecte des offrandes, certaines personnes doivent garder un œil dessus. Ils devraient juste se tenir debout et regarder. C'est ce qu'ils font dans certains supermarchés. Pendant que vous faites vos courses, un employé du supermarché vous surveille discrètement. Il peut simplement vous saluer, \"Oh, comment allez-vous?\" En les voyant autour de vous, n'êtes-vous pas conscient qu'ils découvriront si vous essayez quelque malice ? Parfois, ils installent même des caméras de surveillance. L'Ecriture dit que les enfants de ce monde sont dans leur génération plus sages que les enfants de lumière. Dans l'église, nous agissons parfois bêtement. Nous tenons les choses pour acquises. Nous ne sommes pas assez diligents. Bien que les gens aient cru en Jésus, il ne s'est pas confié à eux, car il savait ce qu'il y avait dans l'homme.  **\nDe nombreux ouvriers chrétiens, membres et ministres de l'évangile commettent des sacrilèges, volent des temples, volent Dieu. Ils volent le temple et s'emparent de l'argent de Dieu, des terres de Dieu, des bâtiments de Dieu et d'autres biens (machines, véhicules, etc.). Le Seigneur nous a donné une révélation concernant les coordonnateurs. Il a dit  «Dites-leur que tout ce qu'ils achètent doit être reçu. Cela m'appartient. Je les jugerai pour tout, même jusqu'à la cuillère qu'ils achètent avec mon argent. Les propriétés de Jésus doivent être traitées avec justice car ne pas le faire a de graves implications.  **\nParfois, les gens émettent des chèques en faveur de l'église pour les dîmes et les offrandes. Dans de tels cas, vous pouvez trouver le comptable de l'église en train de persuader le membre d'ouvrir le chèque pour l'encaisser à la banque en raison d'un besoin urgent d'argent liquide. Le député pourrait facilement rendre service parce qu'il croit qu'il a affaire à un homme juste. Le comptable peut dire   « Oh ma sœur, ce chèque que vous avez donné peut être retardé parce que notre banque est différente de la vôtre. Pourriez-vous le réécrire et y mettre mon nom afin que je puisse retirer l'argent de la banque pour répondre aux besoins urgents de l'église. » La pensée de la personne qui a apporté le chèque est  \"J'ai rencontré un homme juste occupant le siège de l'autorité dans l'église.\" Ne traite-t-elle pas avec le comptable de l'église ? Ceci fait, le comptable se rend ensuite à la banque pour encaisser l'argent puisqu'il est désormais à son nom. Aucun enregistrement; l'argent devient le sien ! Il ne se sent pas coupable, car sa conscience est morte. Si on demande au comptable de diriger les prières, vous penserez que Satan a des ennuis ! Satan les connaît – des tricheurs et des hypocrites. Puisque nous avons ces types de personnes parmi nous, nous devons nous lever avec sagesse pour les dépasser ; sinon, Satan les utilisera pour appauvrir l'église.  **\n3.3 Étude de cas d'un faux converti musulman  **\nUn jeune peul est venu récemment dans notre camping et a raconté une histoire sensationnelle. Il a dit qu'il venait de Warri, dans l'État du Delta du Nigéria. Il a dit qu'un pasteur l'avait invité à Warri de Wukari dans l'État de Taraba pour le former à l'école biblique, mais lorsqu'il y est arrivé, il n'a pas pu contacter ce pasteur. Tous les efforts pour le joindre par téléphone ont échoué et il s'est retrouvé bloqué. Il dit avoir eu la chance de trouver de bons samaritains de la tribu Igbo (sud-est du Nigeria) qui l'ont hébergé pendant quatre jours. Il a continué à essayer de contacter le pasteur jusqu'à ce que l'argent sur lui soit épuisé. Il a dit qu'il était arrivé à un point où il devait vendre son combiné pour subvenir à ses besoins. Il a alors commencé à chercher de l'aide pour retourner à Wukari. On lui a conseillé de rejoindre un camion 911 ou un véhicule articulé (remorque motorisée) allant vers le nord (éventuellement vers Kaduna ou Kano). Cette idée lui a semblé bonne puisqu'il lui est venu à l'esprit que s'ils pouvaient simplement le déposer à Abuja, il pourrait chercher de l'aide au camping de la sainteté, après avoir assisté une fois à une conférence là-bas. C'est ainsi qu'il trouva le chemin du camp.  **\nÀ son arrivée, il a décrit l'un de nos pasteurs à Wukari et a dit qu'il allait à l'église là-bas. Il nous a donné les numéros de téléphone de certains frères de Wukari que nous pouvions appeler pour confirmation. Nous avons appelé les numéros et ils ont confirmé qu'il avait effectivement fraternisé là-bas, mais n'ont pas pu confirmer les affirmations concernant son voyage à Warri. Nous avons essayé de joindre le pasteur de Warri, celui qui encadrait les convertis de l'islam, mais il n'y a pas eu de réponse immédiate. Je lui ai ensuite remis quinze mille nairas (15 000 nairas) pour qu'il retourne à Wukari. Étant peul, il avait peur de passer par Makurdi à cause du problème qui s'y trouvait. Il quitta le camp pour la ville, accompagné d'un frère, pour continuer le voyage le lendemain. Après qu'ils soient partis avec l'argent, le pasteur de Warri m'a alors rappelé et je lui ai raconté toute l'histoire. Il a ri et a enchaîné avec une histoire différente. Il a dit   « C'est moi qui lui ai débloqué l'argent du transport pour qu'il vienne à Warri. Comme je savais que leurs principaux problèmes étaient la toxicomanie et la féminisation, je me suis assuré de restreindre ses mouvements. Ce garçon est sorti de force parce qu'il avait besoin d'acheter des drogues dures. Quand il revint, je fortifiai davantage la place et il se révolta. Il a choisi de retourner à Taraba et est allé voir des musulmans là-bas en disant   « Regardez cette personne. Il m'a invité à venir ici et veut faire de moi un chrétien de force. Suis-je venu ici pour la Bible ? Est-ce pour le christianisme que je suis venu ici ? Les frères musulmans là-bas lui ont donné de l'argent pour retourner dans l'État de Taraba. Il est venu nous voir à Abuja avec une langue trompeuse pour plus d'argent.   **\nMais c'est la même personne qui nous disait   « Je suis un chrétien, je suis un musulman converti. Langue mensongère ! Quand j'ai entendu le récit véridique, j'ai appelé le frère qui l'avait escorté jusqu'à la ville, lui ai raconté l'histoire vraie et lui ai dit   « Récupérez-lui mon argent. Mettez-le dans un véhicule à Wukari, payez le trajet et ramenez le solde d'argent; sinon, il l'utilisera pour acheter de la drogue. Faites-lui également savoir que nous connaissons maintenant la véritable histoire à son sujet. Par la suite, j'ai appelé le pasteur de Wukari et lui ai raconté la véritable histoire afin que les frères là-bas connaissent son véritable caractère de personne trompeuse et frauduleuse.  **\nPsaume 12 verset 1 à 4  **\n1 Secours, Éternel ! car l'homme pieux cesse; car les fidèles manquent parmi les enfants des hommes.\n2 Ils parlent de vanité chacun avec son prochain, avec des lèvres flatteuses et avec un cœur double ils parlent. 3 L'Éternel retranchera toutes les lèvres flatteuses et la langue qui parle avec orgueil.\n4 Qui ont dit   Avec notre langue nous vaincrons ; nos lèvres sont à nous, qui est notre maître ?  **\nOù trouvons-nous de vrais leaders qui disent la vérité ? Ces hypocrites vendent des mensonges parce que l'environnement est passif et permissif. Que le Seigneur nous donne la grâce de les localiser et de les débusquer au nom de Jésus. Ils falsifient les dossiers pour dissimuler leurs mensonges. Ils peuvent obtenir de l'argent de l'église et dire   « Nous l'avons dépensé pour l'évangélisation ici ; nous l'avons dépensé pour l'évangélisation là-bas », alors qu'en réalité aucune évangélisation n'a eu lieu nulle part. C'est leur vie ! Ils peuvent endurcir leur cœur comme Judas qui n'a pas été condamné même en présence de Jésus.  **\nLorsqu'ils sont pris en flagrant délit, certains diront avec audace et sans vergogne   « Savez-vous combien j'ai investi dans ce ministère ? Est-ce parce que j'ai pris ce truc que tu parles ? Savez-vous combien de travail j'ai mis ici ? Combien me paient-ils ?\" Ils usent de bravade pour banaliser et justifier l'iniquité ! D'autres volent par procuration, en utilisant d'autres pour perpétrer une fraude. Au moment où il s'ouvrira, il sera à peine retracé jusqu'à eux car ils ont minutieusement couvert leurs traces. Ils l'arrangent parfaitement de telle sorte qu'ils ne seront jamais suspectés ou sous les projecteurs. Les pasteurs d'église, les agents de compte, les trésoriers et les travailleurs de courses subissent ces attaques entre les mains de Satan. En tant que pasteur, soyez prudent avec l'argent. Si vous êtes trésorier, soyez prudent avec l'argent. Si en tant que garçon de courses on vous dit   \"Allez déposer cet argent à la banque, ou allez retirer cet argent\", faites attention de ne pas tomber dans le piège du diable.     **\n3.4 Étude de cas d'un jeune homme tenté par Satan pour voler l'argent du ministère  **\nIl y a quelque temps, alors que j'étais à Ibadan, dans l'État d'Oyo, au Nigéria, un jeune homme m'a récupéré des publications pour les vendre dans un autre État du Nigéria. Ils étaient vendus à crédit. Plus tard, je lui ai demandé d'aller chercher l'argent et de me l'apporter. Le montant en jeu était d'environ cinquante mille nairas nigérians (50 000 N). Quand il est revenu, il m'a raconté une histoire incroyable qui m'a choqué. Il a dit sur le chemin du retour, une pensée lui est venue   « Descendez du véhicule, allez dans la brousse et blessez-vous avec un couteau pour que le sang jaillisse de votre corps. Alors va lui dire que des voleurs à main armée t'ont attaqué en chemin et ont récupéré tout l'argent sur toi. Il a dit qu'il avait réfléchi à cette pensée pendant un moment, mais qu'il avait finalement résisté à la tentation.  ** \nAssurément, je peux vous dire que cela s'est produit parce que l'argent est entré dans sa main et qu'il était seul. Lorsque l'argent tombe entre vos mains alors que vous êtes seul, Satan commencera à planter de mauvaises idées dans votre cœur pour vous corrompre. En général, lorsque vous êtes assis dans l'église et que vous entendez la parole, vous ne pensez peut-être à aucun acte mauvais, ni argent, ni immoralité. Jamais! C'est quand vous vous retrouvez avec un sexe opposé seul dans une pièce, alors la pensée immorale vient. Avec deux d'entre vous dans un endroit isolé, vous ne pouvez pas comprendre comment cela va se passer (même si ce n'est pas le cas pour tout le monde). Votre rythme cardiaque augmente et le langage corporel commence à transmettre des messages. Si vous êtes faible dans ce domaine, des actions peuvent suivre. De même, si vous êtes sujet à la tentation de l'argent, vos pensées changeront dès que l'argent entrera dans votre main. Le prochain démon qui vous rendra visite est le démon du mensonge, travaillant avec le démon de la sagesse charnelle, tout cela à cause de cet argent.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 5 versets 22 à 24  **\n22 Abstenez-vous de toute apparence de mal.\n23 Et le Dieu même de paix vous sanctifie entièrement ; et je prie Dieu que tout ton esprit, ton âme et ton corps soient préservés sans reproche jusqu'à la venue de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.\n24 Celui qui vous appelle est fidèle, qui le fera aussi.  **\nC'est une chose dangereuse de garder l'argent de l'église. Vous devez être priant, sinon comme cela n'a pas aidé Judas, mais l'a mené irrémédiablement loin, cela vous fera la même chose. C'est la raison pour laquelle nous disons que les trésoriers doivent garder l'argent du ministère à la banque, pas dans la maison, de peur que Satan n'apporte la maladie la nuit et que la seule solution à cette maladie soit l'argent de Dieu entre vos mains. Satan vous fournira également suffisamment de mensonges pour dissimuler votre méfait. C'est la raison pour laquelle vous devez être sage dans cette affaire. Que les pasteurs aident leur peuple et comme eux aussi s'aident eux-mêmes. Les gens prennent l'argent de Dieu sans suivre la procédure régulière, échouant ainsi devant Dieu et les hommes. Beaucoup ont même oublié combien d'argent de Dieu est entre leurs mains pour leur damnation. Vous devez vous efforcer d'être fidèle dans la gestion de l'argent de Dieu, que ce soit dans votre église locale ou dans le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté. Réfléchissez bien et si vous vous souvenez que vous avez détourné l'argent de l'église dans le passé, allez le confesser et faites votre dédommagement.  **\nCertaines personnes ont de la chance, comme nous l'avons vu, elles sont mortes dans ce genre de péché et Dieu les a renvoyées pour venir faire la restitution. Mais combien ont cette chance ? Combien sont morts et sont revenus ? Maintenant que le Seigneur a dit qu'Il vous jugera jusqu'à la cuillère que vous avez achetée avec Son argent, combien plus les choses plus grandes ? Peut-être avez-vous pris un livre de cantiques à l'église, personne n'est au courant et il reste dans votre maison. Vous devez restituer rapidement ces objets en votre possession. Si les choses que vous avez prises illégalement se sont gâtées ou ont été consommées, confessez-les à Dieu et à votre chef, et remplacez-les en nature ou en espèces.  **\nCHAPITRE 4  **\nSOYEZ LE GARDIEN DE VOTRE FRERE  **\nSi une personne pense qu'elle est pasteur alors qu'il y a de mauvais dossiers contre elle, elle ne fait que se tromper. Si vous pensez que vous êtes un Coordinateur, un Surveillant, un Leader, quand ses mains sont souillées par l'argent ou la propriété de Dieu, il n'est rien. C'est la réalité de nos jours. Mais comment réagir face à ce genre de situation ? Les dirigeants de l'église qui sont de fidèles intendants de Dieu doivent se lever et purifier l'église de ces corruptions et souillures afin que la présence du Dieu saint puisse revenir dans son église,  **\n4.1 Restaurer en douceur le soldat déchu du Christ  **\nGalates 6 verset 1 à 3  **\n1 Frères, si un homme est surpris en faute, vous qui êtes spirituels, rétablissez-le dans un esprit de douceur ; considère toi-même, de peur que toi aussi tu ne sois tenté.\n2 Portez les fardeaux les uns des autres, et accomplissez ainsi la loi de Christ.\n3 Car si un homme pense qu'il est quelque chose, alors qu'il n'est rien, il se trompe lui-même.  **\nCertes, beaucoup sont blessés, beaucoup sont souillés et beaucoup ont été abattus. Qu'est-ce qu'on fait? Nous devons prendre des mesures pour les restaurer soigneusement. Ce faisant, nous devons faire attention à ne pas devenir complice car ils peuvent se lier d'amitié avec vous et vous donner une partie du butin de la corruption pour acheter votre conscience.  **\nVous voulez sauver quelqu'un qui est tombé dans un fossé, faites attention à ce qu'il ne vous entraîne pas dedans. Rétablis-le dans un esprit de sagesse et de douceur. Appliquer les bonnes méthodes. N'allez pas avec une attitude de jugement, \"Vous allez en enfer!\" De cette façon, vous ne l'aiderez pas. Vous devez le traiter avec douceur. Par exemple, vous pouvez dire   « Oh mon frère, je suis venu t'aider. Prions ensemble pour que l'aide divine vous parvienne. C'est ce que Dieu veut. Si nous ne le faisons pas, nous ne les aidons pas à se rétablir. La porte de la vie éternelle peut leur être définitivement fermée. C'est ce que l'Écriture enseigne.  **\nProverbes 27 verset 23  **\nSoyez diligent pour connaître l'état de vos troupeaux, et faites bien attention à vos troupeaux.\nJacques 5 verset 19, 20  **\n19 Frères, si quelqu'un d'entre vous s'écarte de la vérité, et que quelqu'un le convertisse ;\n20 Qu'il sache que celui qui convertit le pécheur de l'égarement de sa voie sauvera une âme de la mort et cachera une multitude de péchés.  **\nIl y a des gens que le Seigneur a confiés au ministère dans sa vigne, mais ils ne sont pas simples. L'amour de l'argent et des choses matérielles les a dépassés et ils sont entraînés en enfer. Il est de notre responsabilité de savoir comment ils vivent. Nous devons veiller à ce qu'ils soient saints dans le service afin qu'ils ne travaillent pas en vain. Aussi, nous devrions savoir comment récompenser ceux qui travaillent dur. Dirigeants chrétiens et pasteurs, soyez diligents pour connaître l'état de votre troupeau. Certains de ceux qui travaillent avec vous souffrent de maladies potentiellement mortelles et vous n'en êtes pas conscients. Pour certains, leur maladie est spirituelle mais vous n'en êtes pas conscient. Autant qu'il est humainement possible, prenez des mesures pour connaître le bien-être de vos membres physiquement, spirituellement, émotionnellement et financièrement. Faites savoir à Dieu que vous avez fait de votre mieux. Au fur et à mesure que vous faites votre petit effort, le soutien divin viendra. Que chaque chef sous vous fasse de même avec les troupeaux sous lui. Faites de votre mieux pour répondre à leurs besoins. Efforcez-vous toujours de leur parler avec amour et gentillesse. Priez pour eux et encouragez-les.  **\n Premiers Rois 12 verset 7  **\nEt ils lui parlèrent, disant   Si tu veux être aujourd'hui le serviteur de ce peuple, si tu le sers, si tu lui réponds et si tu lui dis de bonnes paroles, alors ils seront tes serviteurs pour toujours.  **\nLes dirigeants doivent également nommer des auditeurs pour vérifier les registres à intervalles réguliers afin de promouvoir la responsabilité et l'intégrité dans les opérations et les finances du ministère. C'est une chose sage à faire pour éviter que les gens ne soient abattus par Satan, car beaucoup ont été blessés et abattus, et beaucoup d'hommes puissants ont été tués par lui.\n4.2 Mettez des hommes honnêtes aux commandes  **\n2 Corinthiens 8 verset 16 à 23  **\n16 Mais grâces soient rendues à Dieu, qui a mis pour vous le même souci dans le cœur de Tite.\n17 En effet, il accepta l'exhortation ; mais étant plus avancé, de son plein gré, il est allé vers vous.\n18 Et nous avons envoyé avec lui le frère, dont la louange est dans l'Évangile dans toutes les Églises ;\n19 Et pas seulement cela, mais qui a aussi été choisi parmi les églises pour voyager avec nous avec cette grâce, qui est administrée par nous à la gloire du même Seigneur, et déclaration de votre bon sens  \n20 Evitant ceci, afin que personne ne nous blâme dans cette abondance que nous administrons  \n21 Pourvoir aux choses honnêtes, non seulement devant le Seigneur, mais aussi devant les hommes.\n22 Et nous avons envoyé avec eux notre frère, que nous avons souvent montré diligent en beaucoup de choses, mais maintenant beaucoup plus diligent, sur la grande confiance que j'ai en vous.\n23 Que quelqu'un interroge Tite, il est mon associé et mon compagnon à votre sujet, ou que nos frères soient interrogés, ils sont les messagers des Églises et la gloire de Christ.  **\nEn ce qui concerne les questions d'argent, la tenue des registres, le stockage et la distribution des nécessités pour les saints et le partage des biens, assurez-vous que ces tâches sont confiées à des hommes et des femmes honnêtes. En tant que pasteurs et coordonnateurs, imitez Paul qui est resté à l'écart des questions d'argent. Alors qu'il s'en protégeait, il veillait aussi à nommer des hommes honnêtes et diligents pour le faire, car il connaissait le mal des hommes. Si vous mettez la mauvaise personne aux commandes, beaucoup de choses iront mal. Par conséquent, Paul a soigneusement sélectionné des personnes pour le travail. Encore une fois, il a essayé de montrer aux gens qu'ils servaient, que les personnes choisies étaient des hommes honnêtes et sincères.  **\nLes personnes que nous choisissons pour exercer notre ministère sur les questions d'argent doivent être des hommes et des femmes dignes de confiance et honnêtes. Ils ne devraient pas être des personnes de caractère douteux. Choisissez des personnes qui sont généralement connues pour être de bonne réputation et d'une grande intégrité. Comme Paul l'a dit   « Pourvoir aux choses honnêtes, non seulement devant Dieu, mais aussi devant les hommes. Certaines personnes voudront peut-être dire   « Dieu sait que je suis honnête ; Dieu sait que mes mains sont propres. Oui, Dieu le sait, mais que l'homme le sache aussi, car Dieu a donné à l'homme le libre arbitre de croire ou de ne pas croire, de vous recevoir ou de ne pas vous recevoir, de vous accepter ou de ne pas vous accepter. Si vous voulez que l'homme vous accepte, donnez-lui la chance de vous prouver. N'allez pas avec le seul témoignage de Dieu, laissez les hommes aussi témoigner de votre fidélité !  **\n2 Corinthiens 8 verset 21  **\nPourvoir aux choses honnêtes, non seulement aux yeux du Seigneur, mais aussi aux yeux des hommes.  **\nPersonne ne devrait dire   « Cette somme d'argent est arrivée, mais je ne sais pas ce qu'ils en ont fait. Toute personne chargée de ressources, qu'il s'agisse d'argent ou d'autres ressources matérielles, devrait être en mesure de rendre compte de sa gestion.\n 1 Corinthiens 4 verset 1, 2  **\n1 Qu'on nous considère ainsi comme des ministres de Christ et des dispensateurs des mystères de Dieu.\n2 De plus, il est exigé des intendants qu'un homme soit trouvé fidèle.  **\n4.3 Promouvoir la transparence dans le ministère  **\nCertaines personnes veulent que l'afflux hebdomadaire soit annoncé lors de l'assemblée générale. Bien que cela soit bon pour la conscience des gens, la sagesse est profitable à diriger. Il pourrait également inviter des voleurs armés à l'église, parce que vous ne savez pas qui est qui dans l'église. En l'entendant, quelqu'un peut commencer à se dire   « Alors il y a tellement d'argent ici ! Cela peut également apporter d'autres problèmes. Que chacun soit persuadé de ce qu'il fait. Pour éviter ces problèmes, il serait préférable de tenir de bons registres et de partager des informations sur la situation financière de l'église lors des réunions de l'exécutif. La règle de base est de vivre saintement et d'être pur dans le ministère, surtout si vous êtes sous le ministère d'un autre homme et que vous devez rendre compte.  **\nIl se peut que vous soyez impliqué dans une entreprise privée lucrative qui vous rapporte beaucoup d'argent et que, à partir de vos revenus, vous choisissiez d'acheter des actifs tels que des terrains ou des voitures ou d'envoyer vos enfants dans des écoles d'élite pour acquérir une bonne éducation ; si vous ne gardez pas une trace appropriée de l'argent du ministère qui vous est confié, les gens ont tendance à commencer à dire   « C'est notre argent qu'il utilise pour vivre dans le plaisir.  **\nComment pourrez-vous les convaincre que ce n'est pas le cas, puisque vous n'avez aucune preuve d'une saine intendance dans vos registres? Si cela se produit dans une église, certains membres peuvent arrêter de payer leur dîme en disant   « Ah, je ne peux pas continuer à payer ma dîme là-bas. Je ne sais pas comment ils utilisent notre argent. Forcerez-vous alors ? Voulez-vous même entendre parler de la plainte? Vous remarquerez simplement que l'afflux de la dîme diminue et vous n'en connaîtrez pas la raison. C'est la décision privée de la dîme et vous l'avez perdu. Laissez votre travail être transparent pour tous.  **\nPremier Timothée 3 verset 7  **\n7 De plus, il doit avoir un bon rapport de ceux qui sont à l'extérieur ; de peur qu'il ne tombe dans l'opprobre et le piège du diable.  **\n4.4 Une supervision adéquate réduit l'incidence du péché  **\nDeuxième Rois 22 verset 4 à 7  **\n4 Montez vers Hilkija, le souverain sacrificateur, afin qu'il fasse la somme de l'argent qui est apporté dans la maison de l'Éternel, que les gardiens de la porte ont recueilli parmi le peuple ;\n5 Et qu'ils la livrent entre les mains de ceux qui font l'ouvrage, qui ont la surveillance de la maison de l'Éternel, et qu'ils la donnent aux ouvriers de l'ouvrage qui est dans la maison de l'Éternel, pour réparer le les brèches de la maison,\n6 Aux charpentiers, aux maçons et aux maçons, et pour acheter du bois et des pierres de taille pour réparer la maison.\n7 Mais on ne leur fit pas de compte de l'argent qui leur était remis, parce qu'ils avaient agi avec fidélité.  **\nCertains dirigeants peuvent bien faire sans supervision. C'est très vrai parce que la Bible nous dit que les gens qu'Ézéchias a fait réparer le temple ont travaillé sans supervision. Ils n'ont pas enregistré ce qu'ils faisaient, mais ils étaient fidèles selon le témoignage scripturaire à leur sujet. Mais combien d'hommes aussi fidèles pouvez-vous trouver aujourd'hui ? Si vous trouvez une personne fidèle, trois ne le sont pas. Lorsque le nombre augmente, il devient encore plus difficile de les trouver. C'est pourquoi des freins et contrepoids doivent être intégrés au système pour contrôler les abus généralisés. Ce sont de tels freins et contrepoids qui réveilleront certaines personnes de leur sommeil et empêcheront d'autres de manipuler les ressources de l'Église.  **\nJean 12 à 4 à 6  **\n4 Alors dit l'un de ses disciples, Judas Iscariote, fils de Simon, qui devait le trahir   5 Pourquoi ce parfum n'a-t-il pas été vendu trois cents deniers, et donné aux pauvres ?\n6 Il dit cela, non qu'il se souciât des pauvres ; mais parce qu'il était un voleur, et qu'il avait le sac, et qu'il avait découvert ce qui y était mis.  **\nCertaines personnes sont capables de surveiller leurs enfants de sexe féminin à mesure qu'elles grandissent, de sorte qu'elles ne tombent pas dans l'immoralité et ne tombent pas enceintes. D'autres n'ont pas l'engagement de le faire. Formons bien nos enfants, afin que même lorsque le diable essaie de les tenter, il ne réussisse pas. Satan ne pourra pas les avoir car ils lui résisteront fermement. Qui est la personne qui va excréter dans un lieu public pendant que les gens regardent ? Personne ne ferait probablement cela. Qui ira déshabiller une femme pour immoralité sexuelle dans un lieu public pendant que les gens regardent ? Même si une telle pensée est dans son esprit, l'environnement ne le permettra pas. Par conséquent, mettons en place une surveillance adéquate et le péché perdra son pouvoir.   **\nLa plupart de ces dirigeants doivent être gardés sous surveillance, correctement dirigés et supervisés pour les garder justes et sans tache. Sinon, ils ne seront pas conservés saints pour le ciel. Ils ont besoin d'être aidés pour arriver au ciel.  **\nPremier Timothée 6 verset 9 à 14  **\n9 Mais ceux qui veulent devenir riches tombent dans la tentation et dans un piège, et dans beaucoup de convoitises folles et nuisibles, qui noient les hommes dans la destruction et la perdition.\n10 Car l'amour de l'argent est la racine de tout mal, que tandis que certains convoitaient, ils se sont égarés de la foi, et se sont percés de beaucoup de douleurs.\n11 Mais toi, homme de Dieu, fuis ces choses ; et recherchez la justice, la piété, la foi, l'amour, la patience, la douceur.\n12 Combats le bon combat de la foi, saisis la vie éternelle, à laquelle tu es aussi appelé, et tu as professé une bonne profession devant de nombreux témoins.\n13 Je te donne ordre devant Dieu, qui vivifie toutes choses, et devant Jésus-Christ, qui a été témoin d'une bonne confession devant Ponce Pilate;\n14 Que tu gardes ce commandement sans tache, irréprochable, jusqu'à l'apparition de notre Seigneur Jésus Christ.  **\nCombien de ministères ont fermé ? Combien de ministres ont été chassés et ont perdu leur ministère à cause d'activités frauduleuses ? Ils le faisaient et ont fini par se faire prendre. Ils pensaient que personne ne les attraperait jamais mais ils ont été attrapés. L'amour de l'argent et l'immoralité vont de pair. Quand quelqu'un a beaucoup d'argent, il peut l'utiliser pour attirer les femmes et acheter la conscience des membres de l'église. Il peut acheter des cadeaux coûteux tels que des montres-bracelets, des combinés, des vêtements et des voitures pour gagner leur amour et leur fidélité. Il a tout l'argent et cela ouvre la porte à l'immoralité et à d'autres choses. L'amour de l'argent est la racine de tous les maux. Ces personnes utilisent l'argent de l'église pour construire et meubler leurs maisons, nourrir et vêtir leurs familles, payer les frais de scolarité de leurs enfants et vivre dans les plaisirs de cette vie. C'est comme le fraudeur qui ramène des sacs d'argent à la maison. Une femme a dit un jour   « Mon mari ramène à la maison des sacs d'argent provenant de diverses entreprises impies et j'ai peur de dormir dans la maison.  **\nAider nos frères à garder la sainteté exige des vérifications régulières, une tenue adéquate des registres et des éclaircissements appropriés sur la tenue des registres. Suivre tous les revenus et tenir un registre approprié de toutes les dépenses. Mettez les travailleurs à jour dans la bonne tenue des registres et n'hésitez pas à corriger et à réprimander si nécessaire. Nous devons le faire pour les maintenir en forme. Apprenez-leur la norme et assurez-vous qu'ils s'y conforment. Assurez-vous de faire toutes ces choses selon la parole du Seigneur.  **\n4.5 Soumettez-vous à un examen minutieux  **\n2 Timothée 3 versets 16 à 17  **\n16 Toute Écriture est inspirée de Dieu, et utile pour enseigner, pour convaincre, pour corriger, pour instruire dans la justice ;\n17 Afin que l'homme de Dieu soit parfait, entièrement pourvu à toutes les bonnes œuvres.  **\nLa réprimande et la correction sont scripturaires. Même là où cela demande de la discipline, c'est scripturaire ; afin que l'homme de Dieu soit parfait, entièrement pourvu à toutes les bonnes œuvres. Celui qui veut aller au ciel dira comme Job   « Ce que je ne vois pas, enseigne-le-moi et si j'ai commis l'iniquité, je ne ferai plus. Cela devrait être votre attitude en tant que personne qui désire aller au ciel.  **\nHébreux 12 verset 14  **\nRecherchez la paix avec tous les hommes et la sainteté, sans laquelle personne ne verra le Seigneur.  **\nDans une église bien établie, il devrait y avoir des comptables et des auditeurs qualifiés. Cela est nécessaire pour que ce travail soit fait correctement. Le comptable tient des registres des revenus et des dépenses et des vérificateurs viennent périodiquement vérifier ses livres comptables. L'auditeur vérifiera et confirmera ces rapports et registres financiers et s'assurera qu'ils sont exacts et fiables et que les actifs du ministère sont protégés. Ces choses doivent être faites par amour et non pour la chasse aux sorcières. Un ministre ou un ouvrier chrétien qui désire la vie éternelle et tremble devant la parole de Dieu doit se rendre, ainsi que ses archives, disponibles pour examen par d'autres croyants qui sont des professionnels en la matière. Si vous êtes un leader chrétien et que vous voulez aller au ciel, vous direz volontiers   « Viens et vérifie-moi ; examinez-moi et connaissez ma voie; éprouvez mon cœur et voyez s'il y a quelque mauvaise voie en moi.  **\n Psaume 139 verset 23 à 24  **\n23 Sonde-moi, ô Dieu, et connais mon cœur qui m'éprouve, et connais mes pensées  \n24 Et vois s'il y a en moi quelque mauvaise voie, et conduis-moi dans la voie éternelle.  **\nC'est la prière du juste, non pas qu'il se fâche et s'offusque lorsqu'ils enquêtent sur lui. Pourquoi ne devrait-il pas faire l'objet d'une enquête pour prouver sa justice ? Même les démons enquêtent sur les croyants. Quand le diable vient vous enquêter, êtes-vous en colère contre lui ? Se souciera-t-il de votre colère ? Savez-vous quand il vient ?  **\nJean 14 verset 30  **\nDésormais, je ne parlerai plus beaucoup avec vous, car le prince de ce monde vient et n'a rien en moi.  **\nJésus a dit  \"Le prince de ce monde vient et n'a rien en moi\"; mais quant à vous, quand il viendra, vous fâcherez-vous contre lui ? Jésus a eu le privilège de savoir que Satan visitait souvent. Lorsqu'un démon quitte un homme, il revient vérifier si l'endroit est à nouveau libre afin d'en reprendre possession. Il y a donc un contrôle sur vous par des démons. Quel est le problème si vos frères vous surveillent ? Qu'y a-t-il de mal si la direction a ordonné que votre travail soit audité ou fasse l'objet d'une enquête ? Quand ils ont vérifié Jésus, ont-ils trouvé du péché en Lui ? Pourquoi ne pas leur permettre de vous surveiller et de ne rien voir afin qu'ils puissent témoigner que vous êtes un homme fidèle ?  **\n4.6 Traiter en toute honnêteté et avec la plus grande intégrité  **\n2 Corinthiens 4 versets 1 à 2  **\n4 1 C'est pourquoi, voyant que nous avons ce ministère, comme nous avons reçu miséricorde, nous ne nous laissons pas abattre;\n2 Mais ont renoncé aux choses cachées de la malhonnêteté, ne marchant pas dans la ruse, ni ne manipulant la parole de Dieu avec ruse ; mais par la manifestation de la vérité nous recommandant à la conscience de tout homme devant Dieu.  **\nC'est un ministère que vous avez reçu de Dieu, vous devez donc renoncer à toute malhonnêteté. Ne marchez pas dans la sagesse charnelle pour faire du profit ou pour couvrir vos fautes. Si quelque chose se gâte dans votre main, ou si de l'argent sous votre garde est perdu et que vous le couvrez, c'est une faute. Est-ce votre argent ? Quand on vous a donné de l'argent pour faire quelque chose et qu'il s'est perdu, en avez-vous parlé à quelqu'un ? Avez-vous mis en lumière que l'argent a été perdu? Peut-être n'avez-vous pas pu comprendre comment il s'est perdu dans votre poche et pour cette raison vous n'avez pas jugé nécessaire de vous signaler, de peur de ce qui se passera. C'est encore de la malhonnêteté.     **\nPeut-être avez-vous fini par placer l'argent perdu dans des dépenses diverses. Qui trompes-tu ? Nous devons renoncer aux choses cachées de la malhonnêteté, ne pas marcher dans la ruse ni manipuler la parole de Dieu de manière trompeuse ; mais par la manifestation de la vérité nous recommandant à la conscience de tout homme devant Dieu. Laissez-les vous juger si vous faites le mal afin que Dieu vous pardonne et ne ferme jamais son royaume contre vous.  **\n4.7 Gérer les biens du ministère avec soin et diligence raisonnable  **\nComment traitez-vous les propriétés du ministère? Peut-être que pendant que vous marchiez, vous avez marché sur un ordinateur portable et qu'il a été endommagé, venez-vous simplement dire  «Hé! Nous avons besoin d'un autre ordinateur portable, un autre ordinateur, l'autre est gâté. Comment s'est-il gâté ? S'est-il abîmé à cause de l'usure normale ou à cause de votre négligence ? Vous pensez peut-être   « Si je leur dis qu'il s'est gâté dans ma main, ils peuvent me demander de le remplacer par mon argent. N'est-il pas préférable pour vous de dire la vérité même s'ils vous demanderont de supporter le coût du remplacement ? Si Dieu vous faisait miséricorde, ils ne le diront pas. Mais même s'ils vous pénalisent, acceptez-le comme la volonté de Dieu. Cela servira de dissuasion future et vous rappellera de pratiquer la diligence et la droiture sur votre chemin vers la vie éternelle.  **\nJob 34 verset 31, 32  **\n31 Assurément, il convient de dire à Dieu   J'ai porté le châtiment, je n'offenserai plus ;\n32 Ce que je ne vois pas, enseigne-moi, si j'ai fait l'iniquité, je ne ferai plus.  **\nToutes choses concourent au bien de ceux qui aiment Dieu. Pourquoi cacher la vérité ? Pourquoi retenir des informations vitales ? Peut-être que quelqu'un a donné une grosse somme d'argent comme offrande ou don, et vous avez pensé que si cet argent est enregistré comme un revenu, il pensera que nous l'avons toujours reçu comme ça, alors vous l'avez exclu de votre entrée dans le rapport mensuel que vous avez envoyé au siège. C'est de l'injustice. Nous ne devons pas travailler dans la malhonnêteté ou la tromperie mais pratiquer la justice aux yeux de Dieu et des hommes. Tous ces conducteurs qui causent des dommages aux véhicules de l'église et ne se signalent pas ne vont pas bien. Peut-être qu'en conduisant le véhicule, quelqu'un les a frappés et au lieu de signaler l'incident, ils ont tranquillement garé le véhicule et n'ont rien dit. Ils ne se sont pas rendus compte que leur aller au paradis en avait été affecté. La peur des conséquences a bloqué la foi, et tout ce qui n'est pas de la foi est un péché. Signalez-vous ! Le Seigneur sait comment traiter votre cas. Vous pouvez être pardonné. Un homme a pardonné à quelqu'un qui a détourné dix mille talents. Lorsque Naaman donna à Guéhazi deux talents d'argent, il fallut deux personnes pour le porter ; combien plus dix mille talents? C'est pour vous montrer combien d'argent a été pardonné à un homme. Pourquoi avez-vous si peur et pensez-vous que Dieu ne peut pas vous pardonner et que vous devez donc cacher vos méfaits ? Pourquoi avez-vous si peur de révéler même les immoralités que vous avez commises ? Ne savez-vous pas que Dieu peut vous pardonner ? Même s'il y a des châtiments, ce sera pour un temps et vous rebondirez. Pouvez-vous voir que la peur charnelle est le problème de votre vie ?  **\nJérémie 3 verset 12 à 14  **\n12 Va, proclame ces paroles vers le nord, et dis   Reviens, Israël infidèle, dit l'Éternel ; et je ne ferai pas tomber ma colère sur toi, car je suis miséricordieux, dit l'Éternel, et je ne garderai pas ma colère à toujours.\n13 Reconnais seulement ton iniquité, que tu as transgressé l'Éternel, ton Dieu, et que tu as dispersé tes voies vers les étrangers sous tout arbre vert, et que tu n'as pas écouté ma voix, dit l'Éternel. 14 Revenez, enfants rebelles, dit l'Éternel; car je suis marié avec vous; et je vous prendrai un d'une ville, et deux d'une famille, et je vous amènerai à Sion  **\n4.8 Laisser les auditeurs faire leur travail sans crainte ni faveur  **\nPermettez aux vérificateurs de vérifier vos livres sans aucune obstruction ni entrave et de se satisfaire de leur vérification. Laissez-les poser toutes les questions qu'ils doivent poser jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient satisfaits, tout comme un agent fédéral de la sécurité routière exigera les papiers de votre véhicule, votre permis de conduire, votre extincteur et votre panneau d'avertissement jusqu'à ce qu'il soit satisfait et vous dise de partir. Soyez prêt à présenter vos faits. C'est ce que signifie travailler dans la perfection. Travaillez dans le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté avec un cœur parfait.  **\nMatthieu 5 verset 48  **\nSoyez donc parfaits, comme votre Père qui est dans les cieux est parfait.  **\nL'auditeur nommé par l'église pour examiner les activités financières de l'église doit le faire sans respect des personnes, car l'œuvre est de Dieu et non de l'homme. Le salut de beaucoup et la gloire du Seigneur y sont. Ce travail d' audit, aller vérifier les gens et les dossiers, n'est pas le travail de l'homme. N'ayez pas peur de l'homme, car si vous le faites, vous décevrez Dieu. Supposons que le pasteur ait manqué à Dieu, en tant qu'auditeur, échoueriez-vous également à Dieu ?   **\nDeutéronome 1 verset 15 à 18  **\n15 J'ai donc pris les chefs de vos tribus, des hommes sages et connus, et je les ai établis chefs sur vous, chefs de milliers, chefs de centaines, chefs de cinquantaines, chefs de dizaines, et officiers parmi vos tribus.\n16 Et j'ai ordonné à vos juges en ce temps-là, disant   Écoutez les causes entre vos frères, et jugez avec justice entre chacun et son frère, et l'étranger qui est avec lui.\n17 Vous ne respecterez personne dans le jugement; mais vous entendrez les petits comme les grands ; vous n'aurez pas peur de la face de l'homme; car le jugement est de Dieu ; et la cause qui est trop dure pour vous, apportez-la-moi, et je l'entendrai.\n18 Et je vous ai commandé en ce temps-là toutes les choses que vous deviez faire.  **\nLe jugement ne vous appartient pas. Ce n'est pas pour l'homme mais pour Dieu. Le Seigneur vous envoie parce que le nom de cet homme est déjà absent du Livre de Vie. Il t'utilise maintenant pour aller racheter ton frère de l'enfer. L'amour couvrira la multitude de péchés. Vous allez maintenant le couvrir du sang de Jésus par la vérité. Parfois, ce n'est pas facile, mais il faut le faire. Vous le faites pour Dieu. Le Seigneur dit   « Allez soulager mon peuple opprimé par un rétrograde. N'a-t-il pas envoyé Moïse aller juger Pharaon pour libérer son peuple de la servitude en Égypte ? Pourquoi devriez-vous avoir peur quand le Seigneur dit « Va et sauve cet homme. Allez l'aider à sortir de la main de Satan ? Il se pourrait même que cet homme soit au-delà de la récupération et qu'il veuille faire de son mieux avant de partir, et que le Seigneur vous envoie pour aller l'intercepter avant que des dommages irréparables ne soient causés ; afin qu'il ne puisse pas conclure ses plans diaboliques avant son départ. Au lieu de faire cela, auriez-vous maintenant peur de l'homme ? Vous devez prier pour vous-même   « Dieu, retire-moi le respect des personnes. La colère de l'homme ne signifie rien, car la colère de l'homme louera le Seigneur.  **\nQuand on demande à un policier d'arrêter une personne, craint-il sa colère ? Il annoncera simplement   « Vous êtes en état d'arrestation ». Si la personne devient trop dure pour lui, il amènera plus de policiers. Si cela devient trop difficile pour eux, ils utiliseront des gaz lacrymogènes, jusqu'à ce que la personne s'affaiblit, puis ils pourront l'arrêter et lui passer les menottes. De la même manière, vous êtes envoyé comme auditeur avec l' autorité du Seigneur Jésus-Christ. Le Seigneur vous donnera de l'audace au nom de Jésus.  **\nDans le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté, nos ministres devraient constituer des comités de vérification et nommer des auditeurs. Nous désirons sincèrement empêcher nos ministres et ouvriers chrétiens d'être contaminés par l'argent. Nous voulons qu'ils soient saints, sans tache, dignes du ciel et prêts à tout moment. C'est notre prière pour eux. Que Dieu nous aide à agir avec sagesse et à réussir dans ce domaine également au nom de Jésus. C'est pourquoi nous devons collaborer pour nous assurer que la justice demeure dans ce ministère. L'injustice d'un homme peut affecter le ministère, nous devons donc lutter contre le péché et la corruption.  **\nANNEXE  **\nCHOSES À RAPPORTER PAR CHAPITRES ET UNITÉS HOREMOW  **\n1. Actifs acquis    **\nIls comprennent   les terrains et les bâtiments, les véhicules à moteur, les motos, les équipements de sonorisation tels que les amplificateurs, les haut-parleurs, les microphones ; Générateurs, téléviseurs, lecteurs DVD, projecteurs, chaires, chaises, etc. Indiquez les dates auxquelles ces articles ont été achetés ou reçus en cadeau à l'église. Les reçus d'achat doivent être classés et il est important qu'une lettre adressée au Mouvement accompagne ces dons. Pour les bâtiments, les voitures, etc., il devrait y avoir des documents de transfert de propriété.  **\nLes rapports doivent indiquer l'emplacement des biens et leur état, qu'ils soient en excellent état, passables ou mauvais. Les rapports doivent indiquer quand l'un de ces articles est vendu, endommagé ou donné. Il est bon que lorsqu'un équipement coûteux doit être acheté ou reçu en cadeau, le dirigeant concerné en fasse part à son supérieur hiérarchique.  **\n2. Dossiers financiers  **\nLe revenu total en dîmes et offrandes collectées, à la fois pendant l'activité de fraternité et en dehors de l'activité de fraternité doit être enregistré. Notez que les cadeaux personnels aux dirigeants ou aux membres qui sont spécifiquement étiquetés comme tels ne font pas partie des offrandes, même lorsqu'ils sont passés dans des sacs d'offrandes. Cependant, cela pourrait être signalé comme un événement distinct si nécessaire. Les rapports financiers doivent indiquer les promesses faites et reçues. Il est important que le coordinateur informe la direction de tous les cadeaux substantiels reçus pour un usage personnel en guise de reconnaissance.   **\nLes offrandes pendant les programmes doivent être comptées par au moins deux personnes et enregistrées de manière appropriée. Les offrandes et autres collectes doivent être déposées sur des comptes HOREMOW. L'utilisation de comptes personnels ou individuels doit être découragée. Garder de l'argent à la maison devrait être découragé, sauf pour les avances destinées à la gestion des activités de la fraternité. Un montant en espèces doit être conservé pour servir d'avance hebdomadaire ou bihebdomadaire pour répondre aux besoins financiers et doit être réapprovisionné auprès de la banque. Des comptes appropriés doivent être tenus sur l'utilisation de l'avance et retirés avec des reçus, le cas échéant. Les coordonnateurs et responsables voyageant pour des réunions en dehors de leur localité peuvent percevoir une avance en espèces pour des questions qui concernent le Mouvement et non pour des besoins personnels ou familiaux, et prendre une retraite appropriée après le voyage.  **\nLa fidélité est requise dans les envois de fonds à tous les niveaux   des unités, des chapitres, des États, des groupes et des nations. Les rapports financiers doivent être accompagnés des relevés bancaires de la période de rapport. Le rapport doit indiquer la charité donnée, les allocations ou allocations prises ou données, les salaires versés à des travailleurs spécifiés, le loyer payé pour des propriétés spécifiées, etc.  **\n3. Rapport sur les programmes  **\nLe rapport doit fournir des statistiques détaillées sur la participation aux réunions hebdomadaires telles que la fraternité hebdomadaire de l'unité et les études bibliques hebdomadaires, les réunions mensuelles des chapitres et les réunions de femmes, les réunions bimensuelles des groupes de chapitres ou des réunions régionales et les réunions combinées trimestrielles d'État ou de zone. Les rapports doivent indiquer le nombre, le groupe d'âge tels que les enfants, les jeunes et les adultes, et le sexe pour montrer les hommes et les femmes. Il devrait y avoir des rapports pour des programmes spéciaux, des croisades, des actions de sensibilisation, etc. Les rapports devraient également indiquer des témoignages spectaculaires, des événements spéciaux, des problèmes et des défis rencontrés et d'autres informations essentielles.  **\nLes coordonnateurs d'État, de zone et nationaux doivent rédiger des rapports pour couvrir les visites du directeur international, chaque fois que cela se produit, et le rapport doit être soumis dans un délai d'un mois après la visite. Notez également qu'il est bon de prévoir une journée pour conseiller vos membres dans votre chapitre.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 5  **\nPENSÉES INSPIRÉES SUR LE PÉCHÉ POUR L'AUTO-EXAMEN  **\nDans votre service pour Dieu, examinez-vous toujours selon ces 21 principes.  **\nA. COMMANDEMENT CONTRE LE PECHE  **\n1. Ne commettez pas de péché.  **\nPremier Jean 3 verset 9  **\nQuiconque est né de Dieu ne commet pas de péché ; car sa semence demeure en lui, et il ne peut pécher, parce qu'il est né de Dieu.  **\nProuvez à vous-même et aux autres que vous êtes un enfant de Dieu, un vrai ministre de Christ en restant à l'écart de toute sorte de péché.  **\nPremier Timothée 5 verset 22  **\nN'imposez soudainement les mains à personne, et ne participez pas aux péchés d'autrui   gardez-vous purs.  **\n2. Ne cachez pas le péché.  **\nProverbes 28 verset 13  **\nCelui qui couvre ses péchés ne prospère pas, mais celui qui les confesse et les abandonne obtiendra miséricorde.  **\nNe cachez pas votre péché, au cas où vous tomberiez dedans. Confessez-le à Dieu et cherchez la restauration en Christ immédiatement et faites vos restitutions là où c'est nécessaire. Aussi, ne cachez pas le péché de quelqu'un d'autre quand Dieu vous donne le privilège de le savoir. Suivez les étapes scripturaires requises pour sa conviction, sa restauration, sa discipline et sa purge de l'iniquité de la maison de Dieu.  **\nDeutéronome 13 verset 8, 14 ;  **\n8 Tu ne lui consentiras pas, tu ne l'écouteras pas; ton œil ne le plaindra pas, tu ne l'épargneras pas, tu ne le cacheras pas non plus;\n14 Alors tu t'informeras, et tu feras des recherches, et tu demanderas avec diligence; et voici, si c'est la vérité, et la chose certaine, qu'une telle abomination se commet parmi vous;\nLévitique 19 verset 17  **\nTu ne haïras pas ton frère dans ton cœur , tu ne feras aucun reproche à ton prochain, et tu ne souffriras pas de péché sur lui.  **\n3. N'encouragez pas le péché.  **\n Exode 22 verset 2  **\nSi un voleur est trouvé en train de rompre et qu'il est frappé de mort, il ne sera pas versé de sang pour lui.  **\nNe suivez pas la multitude pour commettre le péché ou encourager quiconque à faire le mal contre son frère et contre Dieu.  **\n4. Ne favorisez pas le péché,  **\nActes 22 verset 19, 20  **\n19 Et j'ai dit   Seigneur, ils savent que j'ai emprisonné et battu dans toutes les synagogues ceux qui croyaient en toi ;\n20 Et quand le sang de ton martyr Étienne fut versé, moi aussi je me tenais là, et je consens à sa mort, et je gardais les vêtements de ceux qui l'avaient tué.  **\nNe répandez pas le mal parmi les hommes ou dans la maison de Dieu. Autant que possible, empêchez le péché de progresser autour de vous.  **\n5. Ne confessez pas la moitié du péché.  **\nJosué 7 verset 19  **\nEt Josué dit à Acan   Mon fils, rends, je te prie, gloire à l'Éternel, le Dieu d'Israël, et fais-lui confession ; et dis-moi maintenant ce que tu as fait; ne me le cache pas.  **\nDieu connaît le péché qui a été commis. Confessez-le entièrement et n'en cachez aucune partie.  **\n6. Ne défendez pas le péché.  **\nLévitique 19 verset 15  **\n15 Vous ne ferez pas d'injustice dans le jugement   tu n'auras pas de respect pour la personne du pauvre, ni d'honneur pour la personne du puissant, mais tu jugeras ton prochain avec justice.  **\nNe vous honorez pas et ne vous plaignez pas de vous-même ou d'un autre et défendez le péché commis et nécessite une confession ou un jugement.   **\n7. Ne refusez pas de juger le péché  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 31, 32  **\n31 Car si nous nous jugeons nous-mêmes, nous ne serions pas jugés.\n32 Mais quand nous sommes jugés, nous sommes châtiés par le Seigneur, afin que nous ne soyons pas condamnés avec le monde.  **\nNe refusez pas de juger le péché en vous-même ou chez les autres. Le jugement actuel sur le péché nous éloigne du péché et nous fait échapper au jugement éternel après la mort.  **\nB. LE PÉCHÉ EN VOUS  **\n1. Le péché en vous ne doit pas vous donner de repos jusqu'à ce qu'il soit parti.  **\nPsaume 51 verset 3, 4  **\n3 Car je reconnais mes transgressions, et mon péché est toujours devant moi.\n4 Contre toi, toi seul, j'ai péché, et j'ai fait ce mal à tes yeux, afin que tu sois justifié quand tu parles, et que tu sois clair quand tu juges.  **\nPermettez au Saint-Esprit de convaincre votre cœur du péché que vous avez commis. N'endurcissez pas votre cœur contre la conviction du Saint-Esprit sur votre péché.  **\n2. Le péché en vous doit être exposé.  **\n Psaume 32 verset 3 à 5  **\n3 Quand je gardais le silence, mes os vieillissaient à force de rugir tout le jour.\n4 Car jour et nuit ta main pesait sur moi, mon humidité s'est changée en sécheresse d'été. Sélah.\n5 Je t'ai reconnu mon péché, et je n'ai pas caché mon iniquité. J'ai dit  Je confesserai mes transgressions à l'Éternel; et tu as pardonné l'iniquité de mon péché. Sélah.  **\nSoyez déterminé à ne cacher aucun péché dans votre vie. Confessez votre péché dans votre vie. Confessez votre péché à Dieu et, si nécessaire, aux personnes appropriées.  ** \n3. Le péché en vous doit être rejeté.  **\nPsaume 97 verset 10  **\nVous qui aimez l'Éternel, haïssez le mal, il préserve l'âme de ses saints; il les délivre de la main des méchants.  **\nHaïr le péché. Rejetez-le. Ne laissez pas le péché s'installer dans votre vie.  **\n4. Le péché en vous doit être amené à Jésus  **\nPremier Jean 2 verset 1, 2  **\n1 Mes petits enfants, je vous écris ces choses, afin que vous ne péchiez pas. Et si quelqu'un a péché, nous avons un avocat auprès du Père, Jésus-Christ le juste  \n2 Et il est la propitiation pour nos péchés, et non seulement pour les nôtres, mais aussi pour les péchés du monde entier.  **\nVivez votre vie sans commettre de péché. Au cas où vous remarqueriez que vous avez commis un péché, courez rapidement vers Jésus et cherchez le pardon des péchés et la purification par Son sang.  **\n5. Le péché en vous doit être détruit.  **\n Romains 6 verset 6  **\nSachant ceci, que notre vieil homme est crucifié avec lui, afin que le corps du péché soit détruit, que désormais nous ne servions plus le péché.  **\nLe corps du péché que vous portez appelé le vieil homme, la nature pécheresse, la nature adamique doit être amené à la croix avec Jésus et être détruit afin que vous ne soyez pas un serviteur du péché.\n6. Le péché en vous doit être remplacé par la justice de Christ.  **\nRomains 8 verset 2 à 4  **\n2 Car la loi de l'Esprit de vie en Jésus-Christ m'a affranchi de la loi du péché et de la mort.\n3 Car ce que la loi n'a pas pu faire, en ce qu'elle était faible par la chair, Dieu envoyant son propre Fils dans la ressemblance d'une chair pécheresse, et pour le péché, a condamné le péché dans la chair  \n4 Afin que la justice de la loi soit accomplie en nous, qui ne marchons pas selon la chair, mais selon l'Esprit.  **\nGrâce à l'expérience gracieuse de la sanctification ou de la pureté du cœur en Christ, le cœur est rendu pur et saint et le croyant est capable d'exercer une pleine victoire sur le péché.\n7. Le péché dans la tentation doit être résisté fermement.  **\nHébreux 12 verset 4  **\nVous n'avez pas encore résisté jusqu'au sang, luttant contre le péché.  **\nRésistez à la tentation de pécher par des prières persistantes. Résistez fermement au péché jusqu'à ce que vous mourriez ou que vous soyez tué  **\nC. LE PÉCHÉ CHEZ LES AUTRES  **\n1. Le péché chez les autres devrait attirer votre pitié.  **\nPsaume 73 verset 18 à 20  **\n18 Certes, tu les as placés dans des lieux glissants, tu les as jetés à la destruction.\n19 Comment sont-ils amenés à la désolation, comme en un instant ! ils sont complètement rongés par la terreur.\n20 Comme un songe quand on s'éveille; ainsi, Seigneur, quand tu te réveilleras, tu mépriseras leur image.  **\nN'enviez pas les pécheurs à cause de leur prospérité, progrès et succès ou parce qu'ils continuent sans être découverts ou jugés. Ayez pitié d'eux car ils continuent sans être découverts ni jugés. Ayez pitié d'eux à cause du jugement divin et du feu de l'enfer à leur fin. Assurément, cela ne va pas bien avec eux maintenant et ce ne sera pas bien avec eux pour toujours.\n2. Le péché chez les autres devrait attirer votre prière.  **\nPremier Jean 5 verset 16  **\nSi quelqu'un voit son frère commettre un péché qui ne mène pas à la mort, il le demandera, et il lui donnera la vie pour ceux qui ne pèchent pas jusqu'à la mort. Il y a un péché jusqu'à la mort; Je ne dis pas qu'il priera pour cela.    **\nLe péché vient de la mauvaise tendance chez l'homme et du pouvoir de Satan sur son âme. Priez que Dieu le délivre de cette mauvaise tendance et détruise l'emprise de satan sur lui. Priez que Dieu tourne son cœur vers Jésus pour son salut. Affrontez satan dans un combat spirituel au cours de sa vie.  **\n3. Le péché chez les autres devrait vous rapprocher  **\nMatthieu 9 verset 9 à 13  **\n9 Et comme Jésus sortait de là, il vit un homme nommé Matthieu, assis à la réception de la coutume, et il lui dit   Suis-moi. Et il se leva, et le suivit.\n10 Et il arriva que, comme Jésus était à table dans la maison, voici, beaucoup de publicains et de pécheurs vinrent et s'assirent avec lui et ses disciples.\n11 Et quand les pharisiens virent cela, ils dirent à ses disciples   Pourquoi votre maître mange-t-il avec les publicains et les pécheurs ?\n12 Mais Jésus, ayant entendu cela, leur dit   Ce ne sont pas ceux qui se portent bien qui ont besoin de médecin, mais les malades.\n13 Mais allez et apprenez ce que signifie   J'aurai pitié, et non des sacrifices ; car je ne suis pas venu appeler des justes, mais des pécheurs à la repentance.  **\nCherchez les pécheurs, rapprochez-vous d'eux, rapprochez-les dans l'amour et la sagesse dans le but de les évangéliser pour Jésus. Attaquez-vous aux rétrogrades pour les ramener à la foi. Traiter avec amour et sagesse.  **\n4. Le péché chez les autres devrait attirer le message d'évangélisation.  **\nEsaïe 58 à 1, 2  **\n1 Crie à haute voix, ne t'épargne pas, élève ta voix comme une trompette, et annonce à mon peuple sa transgression, et à la maison de Jacob ses péchés.\n2 Pourtant, ils me recherchent chaque jour et prennent plaisir à connaître mes voies, comme une nation qui pratique la justice et n'abandonne pas l'ordonnance de leur Dieu, ils me demandent les ordonnances de la justice ; ils prennent plaisir à s'approcher de Dieu.  **\nPrêchez l'évangile du salut et de la libération du péché par la foi en Christ aux pécheurs et aux rétrogrades. Prêchez-leur le message de la repentance et de la restitution.\n5. Le péché chez les autres devrait attirer des méthodes de gain d'âme   **\n Proverbes 11 verset 30  **\nLe fruit du juste est un arbre de vie ; et celui qui gagne des âmes est sage.   **\nLa sagesse est la capacité de choisir la bonne méthode qui fonctionnera pour évangéliser chaque pécheur et rétrograde. La sagesse vient par la prière. Demandez à Dieu ce qu'il faut faire pour sauver cette personne.   **\n6. Le péché chez les autres devrait vous faire dépenser pour leur salut.  **\n 2 Corinthiens 12 verset 15  **\nEt je serai très heureux de dépenser et d'être dépensé pour vous; mais plus je t'aime abondamment, moins je suis aimé.  **\nCela coûte à Dieu Son Fils parce qu'Il a voulu le salut des êtres humains. Il en coûte à Jésus sa vie pour que le salut humain soit atteint. Cela doit nous coûter de l'argent, du temps, de l'énergie, même nos vies pour le salut des individus, de la tribu et de la nation.  **\n7. Le péché chez les autres devrait vous faire mépriser la persécution pour leur salut.  **\nActes 20 verset 22 à 24  **\n22 Et maintenant, voici, je vais lié par l'esprit à Jérusalem, ne sachant pas ce qui m'y arrivera;\n23 Sauf que le Saint-Esprit témoigne dans chaque ville, disant que les liens et les afflictions me supportent.\n24 Mais aucune de ces choses ne m'émeut, et je ne considère pas ma vie comme chère à moi-même, afin que je puisse terminer ma course avec joie, et le ministère que j'ai reçu du Seigneur Jésus, pour témoigner l'évangile de la grâce de Dieu. .  **\nDes persécutions viendront sûrement sur le chemin du gagneur d'âmes et du ministre de l'évangile cherchant le salut et la sainteté des croyants. Mais comme Paul l'apôtre le déclare, aucune de ces choses ne devrait nous décourager dans notre ministère pour Jésus parmi les hommes. Malheur à nous si nous ne prêchons pas l'évangile pour sauver les pécheurs, par crainte des persécutions.\n\n",

      "body": "MINISTÈRE DES ÉCRITURES D'UNE SAINTE FEMME **\nINTRODUCTION **\nMatthieu 9 verset 37, 38 **\nAlors il dit à ses disciples   La moisson est vraiment abondante, mais les ouvriers sont peu nombreux ; Priez donc le maître de la moisson, qu'il envoie des ouvriers dans sa moisson. **\nJe crois que ce livre est sorti en cette fin des temps pour répondre à la prière des saints, passés et présents, que Dieu puisse envoyer plus d'ouvriers à sa moisson abondante. Les vérités présentées dans ce livre libéreront de nombreuses ouvrières dans le champ de la moisson. Nous avons examiné le ministère des femmes dans l'Ancien et le Nouveau Testament pour ouvrir les yeux des femmes chrétiennes sur le besoin que Dieu a d'elles dans son champ de moisson. Les écritures que beaucoup ont utilisées pour construire la tradition et la doctrine contre le ministère des femmes ont été examinées par la grâce de Dieu et l'aide du Saint-Esprit. La clé utilisée dans ce livre pour obtenir la bonne signification des Écritures que beaucoup ont mal interprétées est de laisser les Écritures interpréter les Écritures. De même que le Seigneur a ouvert la porte devant l'église de Philadelphie pour leur justice et leur sainteté, de même la porte du plein fonctionnement du service chrétien de la prédication, de l'enseignement, du chant et autres est grande ouverte à la femme chrétienne juste et sainte. **\nCe livre est également écrit comme une lettre spéciale aux dirigeants des dénominations et des assemblées chrétiennes qui inhibent le ministère de la femme par une interprétation et une application erronées de certaines Écritures. À la lumière de la vérité énoncée ici, il leur est demandé de laisser les femmes prêcher, enseigner ou faire tout ce que le Seigneur leur assigne sans entrave, tant qu'elles le font dans la droiture et la sainteté sans usurper l'autorité de l'homme sur elles. **\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPITRE 1  **\nMINISTERE DES FEMMES DANS L'ANCIEN TESTAMENT  **\nIl existe de nombreuses traditions, confusions et restriction de la participation de la femme aux activités spirituelles au point que la femme s'assied à faire peu ou rien du tout dans l'église. Ceux qui sont zélés et aiment faire quelque chose ont peur de pécher, d'aller à l'encontre de la volonté de Dieu ou non. Il est important de parcourir la Bible pour voir ce que l'Écriture a à dire sur la femme. L'Écriture a révélé les instructions du Seigneur la concernant dans le ministère chrétien. Ce sont des choses que Dieu désire et que la Bible dit réellement concernant le ministère chrétien et la femme que certains interprètent mal. Le but de ce livre est de faire comprendre à la femme chrétienne ce que dit la Bible concernant l'usurpation de l'autorité de l'homme afin qu'elle puisse trouver sa place dans le ministère et opérer au maximum pour Jésus.  **\n1.1 La femme   une rencontre d'aide pour l'homme  **\nGenèse 2 verset 18 **\nEt l'Éternel Dieu dit qu'il n'était pas bon que l'homme soit seul; Je lui ferai une aide pour lui.  **\nDieu savait qu'il n'est pas bon que l'homme qu'il a créé soit seul. Pour correspondre avec lui, Dieu a créé l'homme pour son but, son culte, son service et pour le ministère. En cela, Dieu dit qu'il n'est pas bon que l'homme soit seul. Il lui a donc fourni une aide qui l'aidera à atteindre son objectif de créer l'homme, que ces choses soient profanes ou spirituelles   une aide devrait être avec lui pour accomplir ces choses. Ainsi, la place d'une femme est vue dans tout ce que l'homme fait depuis le début. Comme il en était dans la création, il en est de même dans la récréation. Comme c'est dans le naturel, c'est comme dans le spirituel.  **\nLa femme accompagne l'homme dans toutes les sphères de la vie pour accomplir avec lui ce que Dieu lui a confié. Dans ce cas donc, l'Ancien et le Nouveau Testament seront considérés pour voir le ministère de la femme dans l'Écriture. La femme a-t-elle occupé une position publique dans l'Ancien Testament ? A-t-elle manifesté une quelconque fonction spirituelle en public parmi le peuple de Dieu ? Avait-elle un ministère parmi les hommes dans l'Ancien Testament ? Examinons quelques cas dans l'Écriture.  **\n1.2 Miriam la Sœur de Moïse  **\nEn examinant ce cas, nous voudrons faire ressortir quelque chose qui sera mieux compris dans le Nouveau Testament.      **\nExode 15 verset 20, 21 **\n20«Et Miriam la prophétesse, soeur d'Aaron, prit un tambourin dans sa main; et toutes les femmes sortirent après elle avec des tambourins et des danses.\n21 Et Miriam leur répondit   Chantez à l'Éternel, car il a glorieusement triomphé ; il a jeté à la mer le cheval et son cavalier.''  **\nMiriam avait un ministère qui était un ministère très important parmi les femmes. Les hommes et les femmes ont apprécié son ministère. Mariam était une prophétesse, une musicienne et une dirigeante. Son rôle de leader était également apprécié par les hommes; et son ministère prophétique n'était pas limité aux femmes seulement mais à tous les Israélites, d'où l'injonction scripturaire selon laquelle les femmes devraient enseigner aux femmes ne limite pas leur ministère aux femmes seulement. En tant que prophétesse, elle s'occupait de tout. Un prophète est celui qui transmet le message de Dieu à son peuple. Elle était une prophétesse envoyée par Dieu en Israël et avait un ministère parmi les hommes et les femmes ainsi que Moïse et Aaron  **\nMichée 6 verset 4 **\nCar je t'ai fait monter du pays d'Égypte, et je t'ai racheté de la maison de servitude; et j'ai envoyé devant toi Moïse, Aaron et Miriam.  **\nL'écriture suivante dans le Nouveau Testament ne doit pas être mal comprise concernant le ministère des femmes.  **\nTite 2 versets 1 à 4 **\n1 Mais dis les choses qui conviennent à la saine doctrine ; 2 Que les vieillards soient sobres, graves, tempérés, sains de foi, de charité, de patience.\n3 Les femmes âgées de même, afin qu'elles se conduisent comme il convient à la sainteté, non de faux accusateurs, peu portées à beaucoup de vin, enseignantes de bonnes choses ;\n4 Afin qu'elles apprennent aux jeunes filles à être sobres, à aimer leurs maris, à aimer leurs enfants  **\nIci, nous voyons les femmes âgées commandées d'enseigner aux jeunes femmes. Cependant, cela ne signifie pas que les femmes âgées doivent restreindre leur ministère d'enseignement aux seules femmes. Ils peuvent aussi enseigner aux hommes et aux femmes comme le font les hommes. Le ministère de la femme n'est pas limité aux femmes seulement. Miriam était une prophétesse et recevait des messages de Dieu. Elle avait un ministère pour tous. La femme ministre doit savoir qu'elle a un ministère envers les femmes et les hommes, car le Seigneur donne la grâce et une porte ouverte.     **\n1.3 Le péché de Myriam  **\nMiriam a été réprimandée par Dieu pour avoir minimisé la position de Moïse, le chef que Dieu a nommé sur Israël  **\nNombres 12 verset 1 à 16 **\nEt Miriam et Aaron parlèrent contre Moïse à cause de la femme éthiopienne qu'il avait épousée, car il avait épousé une femme éthiopienne.\n2 Et ils dirent   L'Éternel n'a-t-il vraiment parlé que par Moïse ? n'a-t-il pas aussi parlé par nous ? Et l'Éternel l'entendit.\n3 Or l'homme Moïse était très doux, au-dessus de tous les hommes qui étaient sur la face de la terre. 4 Et l'Éternel dit soudain à Moïse, à Aaron et à Miriam   Sortez vous trois au congrégation. Et ils sont sortis tous les trois.\n5 Et l'Éternel descendit dans la colonne de nuée, et se tint à l'entrée du tabernacle, et appela Aaron et Miriam, et ils sortirent tous deux.\n6 Et il dit  Écoutez maintenant mes paroles  S'il y a un prophète parmi vous, moi, l'Éternel, je me ferai connaître à lui dans une vision, et je lui parlerai en songe. 7 Il n'en est pas ainsi de mon serviteur Moïse, qui est fidèle dans toute ma maison.\n8 Avec lui je parlerai bouche à bouche, même en apparence, et non dans des paroles obscures ; et il verra l'image de l'Éternel, pourquoi donc n'avez-vous pas craint de parler contre mon serviteur Moïse? 9 Et la colère de l'Éternel s'enflamma contre eux; et Il est parti.\n10 Et la nuée se retira de dessus le tabernacle ; et voici, Miriam devint lépreuse, blanche comme neige; et Aaron regarda Miriam, et voici, elle était lépreuse.\n11 Et Aaron dit à Moïse   Hélas, mon seigneur, je te supplie, ne fais pas peser sur nous le péché dans lequel nous avons agi follement et dans lequel nous avons péché.\n12 Qu'elle ne soit pas comme un mort, dont la chair est à moitié consumée quand il sort du ventre de sa mère.\n13 Et Moïse cria à l'Éternel, en disant   Guéris-la maintenant, ô Dieu, je te prie.\n14 Et l'Éternel dit à Moïse   Si son père lui avait seulement craché au visage, n'aurait-elle pas honte pendant sept jours ? qu'elle soit exclue du camp pendant sept jours, et après cela qu'elle soit de nouveau reçue.\n15 Et Miriam fut exclue du camp pendant sept jours, et le peuple ne partit pas jusqu'à ce que Miriam ait été ramenée.\n16 Et ensuite le peuple partit de Hazeroth, et campa dans le désert de Paran  **\nDe cette Écriture, nous découvrons que Dieu a donné à Miriam un ministère mais elle voulait usurper l'autorité sur Moïse et Dieu ne voulait pas le prendre. Miriam voulait terroriser ou intimider Moïse, peut-être, parce qu'elle était la sœur aînée. Pas dans les affaires de Dieu ! Dans la création, Dieu a placé la femme sous un homme. L'homme est devenu le chef de la femme. Cette autorité est flagrante à tous égards dans la société humaine. Il en est ainsi dans le cadre du mariage et de la famille. Les femmes d'une famille reconnaissent la direction ou le leadership de l'homme parmi elles lorsqu'il atteint l'âge adulte. La société reconnaît son autorité et sa représentation sur la famille au-dessus de toute femme de la famille. Ses sœurs aînées et cadettes se soumettent volontiers à son autorité et à sa direction familiale. Ceci est naturellement attendu d'eux par la société. Dieu donne le ministère aux femmes chrétiennes. Mais il s'attend à ce qu'ils respectent les hommes dans l'église. Il ne le prendra pas à la légère lorsqu'une femme manque de respect aux hommes et se comporte de manière indisciplinée parmi eux. Si la femme chrétienne peut être humble, douce et sainte, elle ira jusqu'au bout dans son ministère chrétien, selon l'appel et la grâce de Dieu sur elle. La vie éternelle sera sa possession.  **\n1.4 Déborah la juge.  **\nDeborah était une autre femme dans l'Ancien Testament qui avait un ministère. Israël était entré dans le péché et l'idolâtrie. Cela les a amenés sous l'esclavage d'un roi païen oppressif. Même lorsque le Seigneur voulait délivrer Israël, aucun des hommes n'était assez courageux pour mener le peuple de Dieu à la victoire. Les hommes ont demandé et se sont soumis au ministère de Deborah.  **\nJuges 4 verset 1 à 9  **\n1 \"Et les enfants d'Israël firent de nouveau ce qui est mal aux yeux de l'Eternel, lorsqu'Ehud mourut.\n2 Et l'Éternel les vendit entre les mains de Jabin, roi de Canaan, qui régnait à Hatsor; le capitaine de son hôte Sisera, qui habitait à Harosheth des Gentils. 3 Et les enfants d'Israël crièrent à l'Éternel , car il avait neuf cents chars de fer; et vingt ans il opprima puissamment les fils d'Israel.\n4 Et Débora, prophétesse, femme de Lapidoth, elle jugea Israël à cette époque-là.\n5 Et elle habita sous le palmier de Débora, entre Rama et Béthel, sur la montagne d'Éphraïm, et les enfants d'Israël montèrent vers elle pour le jugement.\n6 Et elle envoya chercher Barak, fils d'Abinoam, de Kedeshnaphtali, et lui dit   L'Éternel, le Dieu d'Israël, n'a-t-il pas commandé   Va et tire vers le mont Thabor, et prends avec toi dix mille hommes des enfants de Nephtali et de les enfants de Zabulon ?\n7 Et je t'attirerai vers le fleuve Kishon Sisera, le chef de l'armée de Jabin, avec ses chars et sa multitude ; et je le livrerai entre tes mains. 8 Et Barak lui dit  Si tu veux aller avec moi, j'irai, mais si tu ne veux pas aller avec moi, je n'irai pas.\n9 Et elle dit   J'irai sûrement avec toi, bien que le voyage que tu fasses ne soit pas pour ton honneur ; car l'Éternel vendra Sisera entre les mains d'une femme. Et Débora se leva, et alla avec Barak à Kedesh.  **\nLes enfants d'Israël avaient rétrogradé. Tous les hommes étaient devenus faibles et craintifs. Personne n'a eu le courage de conduire le peuple à la justice et à la victoire. Dieu a donné un ministère à Deborah à cette époque. Elle a jugé Israël. C'est-à-dire qu'elle a fait connaître aux gens les voies justes de Dieu et leur a montré comment vivre dans la crainte de Dieu. Elle était une prophétesse. Elle a livré, prêché et enseigné la Parole de Dieu à son peuple. Le récit de son ministère et de ses relations montrait clairement qu'elle n'usurpait pas l'autorité de l'homme. Elle a reconnu le leadership ou la direction des hommes sur les femmes. Par inspiration, elle a appelé un homme à prendre la tête contre l'ennemi. Notez ici que les hommes ont reconnu son autorité divine dans le ministère et s'y sont soumis. La question n'est pas de savoir qui est dans le ministère, mais sur qui Dieu a placé sa grâce et son onction. Deborah a fait preuve d'humilité et de douceur, reconnaissant la place de l'homme dans son ministère. Il n'y a pas eu d'abus de pouvoir ni d'irrespect envers les hommes. Son service et son leadership ont été acceptés avec joie et elle a accompli son ministère à la gloire de Dieu. Deborah était une femme mariée qui jouait bien son rôle auprès de son mari, selon son amour, sa soumission, son obéissance et son service d'épouse. C'est bon aux yeux de Dieu. Laissez la femme agir doucement avec les hommes. Bien que le Seigneur lui ait donné l'appel et la grâce pour le ministère, elle devrait faire preuve de honte et de sobriété, d'humilité et de douceur lorsqu'elle manipule ou traite avec les hommes.   **\nDans Juges 5 versets 1 à 2, la Bible dit   **\n1 \"Alors chantèrent Débora et Barak, fils d'Abinoam, en ce jour-là, disant  \n2 Louez l'Éternel pour la vengeance d'Israël, lorsque le peuple s'est volontairement offert. Aux versets 6 à 8 du même chapitre, il est dit  \n6 « Aux jours de Schamgar, fils d'Anath, aux jours de Jaël, les routes étaient désertes, et les voyageurs passaient par des chemins détournés.\n7 Les habitants des villages ont cessé, ils ont cessé en Israël, jusqu'à ce que moi, Debora, je sois née, que je sois devenue une mère en Israël.\n8 Ils ont choisi de nouveaux dieux; alors était la guerre dans les portes   y avait-il un bouclier ou une lance vu parmi quarante mille en Israël ?''\nLe verset 12 dit alors   12 « Réveille-toi, réveille-toi, Deborah ; réveillez-vous, réveillez-vous, prononcez une chanson; Lève-toi, Barak, et emmène ta captivité en captivité, toi, fils d'Abinoam.  **\nIsraël avait péché et le Seigneur les a vendus à la main du roi Jabin et l'homme les a opprimés pendant vingt ans. La route était déserte ; cela implique que le peuple ne suivait plus l'autoroute par peur de ses ennemis. Les hommes avaient si peur qu'ils cessèrent de marcher ouvertement de peur d'être attaqués par les ennemis.  **\nJuges 4 verset 6 à 8   **\n6 « Et elle envoya chercher Barak, fils d'Abinoam, de Kedeshnaphthali, et lui dit   N'a-t-il pas commandé à l'Éternel, le Dieu d'Israël, de dire   Va, tire vers le mont Thabor, et prends avec toi dix mille hommes parmi les enfants de Naphtali et des enfants de Zabulon ?\n7 Et je t'attirerai vers le fleuve Kishon Sisera, le chef de l'armée de Jabin, avec ses chars et sa multitude ; et je le livrerai entre tes mains.\n8 Et Barak lui dit   Si tu veux aller avec moi, j'irai ; mais si tu ne veux pas m'accompagner, je n'irai pas.  **\nC'était la parole du Seigneur, mais il n'y avait pas de courage chez les hommes. Tous les hommes avaient peur. Cela a fait place à la femme. Le premier choix a été donné à l'homme, mais il a échoué. Dieu a recherché le deuxième choix, a mis de l'autorité en elle et l'a utilisée pour accomplir son dessein. Là où les hommes ont échoué à cause de la peur et de la lâcheté, les femmes se sont élevées comme compagnes. Là où les ténèbres tombent sur les hommes, la lumière des femmes brille de mille feux.  **\n1.5 Une mère en Israël.  **\nDeuxième Samuel 20 verset 16 à 19\n16Alors une femme sage s'écria de la ville  Écoutez, écoutez! dis, je te prie, à Joab  Approche-toi d'ici, que je te parle.\n17 Et lorsqu'il s'approcha d'elle, la femme dit   Es-tu Joab ? Et il a répondu, je suis lui. Alors elle lui dit   Écoute les paroles de ta servante. Et il a répondu, j'entends.\n18 Alors elle parla, disant   Ils avaient l'habitude de parler autrefois, disant   Ils consulteront sûrement Abel, et ainsi ils ont mis fin à l'affaire.\n19 Je suis l'un de ceux qui sont pacifiques et fidèles en Israël, tu cherches à détruire une ville et une mère en Israël, pourquoi engloutiras-tu l'héritage de l'Éternel ?  **\nDe ce passage, nous voyons que cette femme était dans la ville où un homme têtu était tombé. Joab, le chef de l'armée de David, est venu pour détruire la ville à cause de cet homme. Mais cette femme sage dans cette ville s'est tenue dans le fossé de la sagesse pour apaiser Joab avec ses paroles et a pu sauver la ville entière d'une catastrophe imminente. Seule la personne têtue a été détruite au lieu de toute la ville. Une ville entière a été sauvée de la destruction par le don de sagesse que Dieu avait donné à cette mère en Israël. Le don de Dieu dans une femme peut la mettre en évidence dans cette vie. Le don d'un homme (d'une femme aussi) lui ouvre la voie et l'amène devant les rois. Le Seigneur a fait un don à cette femme. Elle dit à Joab   « Je fais partie de ces gens, de sages conseillers, qui conseillent Israël. Es-tu venu pour tuer tout le monde dans cette ville ? Alors tu détruiras une mère en Israël. Le don que Dieu a fait à une femme lui ouvre la porte du ministère parmi le peuple de Dieu. Il était clair que les hommes et les femmes en Israël avaient recours à cette femme pour obtenir des conseils.  **\n1.6 Humilité chez les femmes ministres  **\nIl y a quelque chose qui se remarque dans le ministère de ces femmes   **\nJuges 5 verset 9  **\nMon cœur est vers les gouverneurs d'Israël, qui se sont offerts volontairement parmi le peuple. Bénissez le SEIGNEUR   **\nPar cette déclaration, Deborah ne s'est pas élevée au-dessus des hommes qu'elle dirigeait et qui travaillaient avec elle. Elle ne méprisait pas l'autorité des hommes. Si elle l'avait fait, elle aurait apporté des imperfections sur elle-même. Ce serait usurper l'autorité des hommes. Son ministère était dirigé par la recommandation et la louange des hommes. Tous ont été bénis et Dieu a été glorifié. La sage conseillère du second Samuel 20 verset 16 à 19 a démontré cette humilité féminine dans son ministère dans la façon dont elle a approché Joab (deuxième Samuel 20 verset 16 à 19). Bien que plus âgée, elle s'appelait sa servante. Avec ses douces paroles apaisantes, elle a pu faire tomber la colère qui était en Joab, sauvant ainsi la ville de la destruction. Nous voyons dans ces femmes, l'humilité, la sainteté et le succès dans le ministère.  **\nDieu ne veut pas que la femme pense qu'elle est supérieure ou supérieure à l'homme. Elle doit reconnaître l'autorité de l'homme car elle est donnée par Dieu dès la création et Il veut qu'elle soit maintenue que ce soit en matière séculière ou spirituelle. Il veut que la femme le reconnaisse et ne se comporte pas autrement, simplement parce qu'elle a certains dons ou une certaine vocation.  **\nLa femme doit toujours savoir qu'elle est subordonnée et que c'est Dieu qui l'a conçu ainsi. Elle ne devrait pas essayer de changer l'ordre car cela lui ferait encourir la colère de Dieu. Elle doit toujours se souvenir de sa position par nature et ne doit pas se précipiter pour s'asseoir sur le trône au-dessus de l'homme. Tant qu'une femme comprend cela et s'y soumet, elle fera de grands exploits pour le Seigneur avec le plein honneur et le soutien des hommes.  **\n1.7 Le Ministère de la Prophétesse Hulda  **\nDeuxième Chroniques 34 verset 20 à 28   **\n20 Et le roi donna cet ordre à Hilkija, à Ahikam, fils de Shaphan, et à Abdon, fils de Michée, et à Shaphan, le scribe, et à Asaïa, serviteur du roi, en disant  \n21 Allez, interrogez l'Éternel pour moi et pour ceux qui restent en Israël et en Juda, concernant les paroles du livre qui se trouve, car grande est la colère de l'Éternel qui s'est déversée sur nous, parce que nos pères n'ont pas gardé la parole de l'Éternel, pour faire selon tout ce qui est écrit dans ce livre.\n22 Et Hilkija, et ceux que le roi avait désignés, allèrent vers Hulda la prophétesse, la femme de Shallum, fils de Tikvath, fils de Hasra, gardien de la garde-robe ; (maintenant elle habitait à Jérusalem dans le collège ;) et ils lui parlèrent à cet effet.\n23 Et elle leur répondit   Ainsi parle l'Éternel, le Dieu d'Israël   Dites-vous à l'homme qui vous a envoyés vers moi  \n24 Ainsi dit l'Éternel   Voici, je vais faire venir le mal sur ce lieu et sur ses habitants, même toutes les malédictions qui sont écrites dans le livre qu'ils ont lu devant le roi de Juda.\n25 Parce qu'ils m'ont abandonné, et qu'ils ont brûlé de l'encens à d'autres dieux, afin de m'irriter par toutes les œuvres de leurs mains ; c'est pourquoi ma colère se déversera sur ce lieu et ne s'éteindra pas.\n26 Et quant au roi de Juda, qui t'a envoyé consulter l'Éternel, tu lui diras ainsi   Ainsi a dit l'Éternel, le Dieu d'Israël, concernant les paroles que tu as entendues ;\n27 Parce que ton coeur était tendre, et que tu t'es humilié devant Dieu, quand tu as entendu ses paroles contre ce lieu et contre ses habitants, et que tu t'es humilié devant moi, et que tu as déchiré tes vêtements, et que tu as pleuré devant moi; Je t'ai aussi entendu, dit l'Éternel.\n28 Voici, je vais te rassembler auprès de tes pères, et tu seras recueilli en paix dans ton sépulcre, et tes yeux ne verront pas tout le mal que je ferai venir sur ce lieu et sur ses habitants. Alors ils rapportèrent à nouveau la parole du roi.  **\nHulda était une prophétesse que Dieu a utilisée pour apporter un message de paix au roi Josias. En tant que prophétesse, le Seigneur l'a utilisée pour apporter un grand réveil à Israël en tant que nation sous le roi Josias. Nous avons dans l'Écriture les paroles sûres de la prophétie par lesquelles la femme chrétienne peut apporter le salut aux individus, aux familles, aux sociétés et aux nations du monde. Car la parole de Dieu dit   « il arrivera que je répandrai mon esprit sur toute chair, et vos fils et vos filles prophétiseront ». C'est la parole de Dieu qui donne le salut et la délivrance. Tout le monde, y compris les femmes, reçoit l'ordre de prêcher la parole de Dieu dans le monde entier.  **\nMarc 16 verset 15 à 16   **\n15 Et il leur dit   Allez par tout le monde, et prêchez l'Evangile à toute créature.\n16 Celui qui croira et sera baptisé sera sauvé; mais celui qui ne croira pas sera damné.  **\nCette commission ne s'adresse pas qu'aux hommes, elle s'adresse aussi aux femmes. La prédication de l'Evangile s'adresse à tous, hommes et femmes. Hulda a reçu la parole de prophétie telle que le Seigneur la lui avait donnée et l'a prêchée aux hommes qui venaient à elle. La Bible nous dit en  **\nDeuxième Pierre 1 verset 18 à 21   **\n18 Et cette voix qui venait du ciel, nous l'avons entendue, lorsque nous étions avec lui sur la sainte montagne.\n19 Nous avons aussi une parole prophétique plus sûre ; à quoi vous faites bien de prendre garde, comme à une lumière qui brille dans un lieu obscur, jusqu'à ce que le jour se lève, et que l'étoile du jour se lève dans vos cœurs ;\n20 Sachant ceci premièrement, qu'aucune prophétie de l'Écriture n'est d'aucune interprétation privée.\n21 Car la prophétie n'est pas venue autrefois par la volonté d'un homme, mais des hommes saints de Dieu ont parlé, poussés par le Saint-Esprit.  **\nÀ partir de ce passage, nous voyons que la prophétie des temps anciens est venue aux hommes et aux femmes et n'a fait l'objet d'aucune interprétation privée. La Bible est la parole prophétique la plus sûre qui soit accessible aux hommes et aux femmes. Par conséquent, les femmes peuvent prophétiser à travers elle en prêchant le message de la Bible. La commission de Christ à ses disciples donne à la femme l'autorité de prêcher et d'enseigner la parole de Dieu aux hommes et aux femmes. C'est la volonté de Dieu pour sa vie. C'est la volonté de Dieu pour ta vie femme !  **\n Matthieu 28 verset 18 à 20   **\nEt Jésus, s'approchant, leur parla, disant   Tout pouvoir m'a été donné dans le ciel et sur la terre.\n19 Allez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit  \n20 Enseignez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai prescrit ; et voici, je suis toujours avec vous, même jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amen.  **\nLes femmes sont des disciples de Christ comme les hommes le sont et doivent obéir à la mission donnée aux disciples de Christ.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 2  **\nMINISTERE DE LA FEMME DANS LE NOUVEAU TESTAMENT  **\nLorsque Jésus, l'homme de Galilée, allait de lieu en lieu, servant les gens, les disciples étaient tous des hommes. La raison n'est pas connue, c'est peut-être à cause du risque encouru. Se promener avec des femmes dans le ministère est risqué, surtout lorsqu'elles sont mélangées avec des hommes. Certaines des femmes disciples étaient mariées et mères d'enfants et de femmes de ménage qui ne peuvent pas quitter leur environnement immédiat. Peut-être sont-ce là les raisons pour lesquelles Jésus n'a pas mélangé les femmes avec les hommes, en veillant à ce que son ministère ne soit pas abusé. Il est essentiel de dire que les femmes dans le ministère doivent faire très attention à ne pas abuser de l'évangile de Christ par zèle sans connaissance. Une femme ministre en particulier est venue à Abuja, au Nigeria, ne connaissant personne et n'ayant pas d'argent. Elle a dit que le Saint-Esprit l'avait conduite à la Cité pour prêcher. Elle a fini par loger dans la même chambre qu'un homme, cuisinant et mangeant ensemble. Dieu ne l'a sûrement pas envoyée ou bien elle a agi bêtement jusqu'à sa destruction. La femme doit être disciplinée. Elle ne doit pas gâcher sa vie. Elle ne doit pas agir imprudemment au nom du ministère. Elle peut facilement tomber dans l'immoralité. Les hommes promiscuité peuvent facilement la vaincre lorsqu'elle est indûment exposée. Elle doit donc être sage et calculer ses manières. Elle doit montrer la dignité du ministre du Christ et la pureté d'une vraie femme chrétienne. Cherchez conseil et soyez guidé dans le ministère.  **\n2.1 Femmes parmi les disciples du Christ  **\nIl y avait des femmes parmi les disciples de Jésus qui servaient le Seigneur selon la grâce qui leur avait été donnée.  **\nLuc 8 verset 1 à 3   **\n1 Et il arriva ensuite qu'il alla dans toutes les villes et tous les villages, prêchant et annonçant la bonne nouvelle du royaume de Dieu ; et les douze étaient avec lui,\n2 Et certaines femmes, qui avaient été guéries d'esprits mauvais et d'infirmités, Marie appela Madeleine, d'où étaient sortis sept démons,\n3 Et Jeanne, la femme de l'intendant de Chuza Hérode, et Suzanne, et beaucoup d'autres, qui le servaient de leurs biens.  **\nCes femmes n'avaient pas le privilège d'aller d'un endroit à l'autre avec les douze. Cependant, lorsque Jésus servait dans des lieux proches d'eux ou dans la communauté, ils se prévalaient de lui rendre service ainsi qu'à ses disciples. C'est une partie très importante du ministère des femmes comme nous le voyons dans les Écritures. C'est ce qu'on appelle le ministère de l'aide. Les femmes peuvent le faire, en soutenant les prédicateurs, en aidant de la manière dont le Seigneur lui donne la grâce d'aider. Le soutien et la provision pour les prédicateurs de l'évangile est un service à Dieu. Beaucoup de femmes sont dans ce ministère. Des hommes opèrent également dans ce ministère.  **\n2.2 Femmes dans le ministère de la prédication  **\nUne autre chose que nous voyons dans le ministère de la femme dans le Nouveau Testament est la prédication de l'évangile. La Bible dit   « Allez par tout le monde et prêchez l'évangile. Lorsque le Seigneur a chargé tout le monde d'aller prêcher et évangéliser, les femmes n'étaient pas en reste. Ils ont également participé à l'annonce de la résurrection de Jésus-Christ. Ils sont sortis et ont prêché partout.  **\nActes 8 verset 3 à 4   **\n3 Quant à Saül, il ravagea l'Église, pénétrant dans toutes les maisons, et faisant venir des hommes et des femmes, il les mit en prison.\n4 C'est pourquoi ceux qui étaient dispersés allaient partout, prêchant la parole.  **\nCependant, cela a été fait avec décence; car Dieu exige la décence. Deux femmes prédicateurs figuraient en bonne place dans le ministère de Jésus-Christ   la Samaritaine et Marie-Madeleine.  **\n2.3 La Femme de Samarie  **\nJean 4 verset 25 à 30, 39 à 42   **\n25 La femme lui dit   Je sais que le Messie vient, qui est appelé Christ ; quand il sera venu, il nous dira toutes choses.\n26 Jésus lui dit   Moi, c'est moi qui te parle. 27 Et là-dessus ses disciples vinrent, et s'étonnèrent de ce qu'il parlait avec la femme ; pourtant personne ne dit   Que cherches-tu ? ou, Pourquoi parles-tu avec elle ?\n28 Alors la femme laissa sa cruche, et s'en alla dans la ville, et dit aux hommes  \n29 Viens voir un homme qui m'a dit tout ce que j'ai fait; n'est-ce pas le Christ? 30 Alors ils sortirent de la ville et vinrent à lui.\n39 Et plusieurs des Samaritains de cette ville crurent en lui, à cause de la parole de la femme, qui témoigna   Il m'a dit tout ce que j'ai fait.\n40 Lorsque les Samaritains furent donc venus vers lui, ils le prièrent de rester avec eux, et il demeura là deux jours.\n41 Et beaucoup plus crurent à cause de sa propre parole ;\n42 Et dit à la femme   Maintenant nous ne croyons pas à cause de ta parole ; car nous l'avons entendu nous-mêmes, et savons qu'il est bien le Christ, le Sauveur du monde.  **\nDe ce passage, nous voyons que la femme de Samarie a immédiatement reçu Jésus lorsqu'elle a été convaincue qu'il était le Christ. La prochaine chose qu'elle fit fut de se lancer dans l'évangélisation. Dès qu'elle a reçu l'expérience du salut, elle s'est mise à prêcher aux gens. C'est naturel. Cela arrive à tous ceux qui rencontrent la puissance salvatrice de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. Le démoniaque était autorisé à prêcher Jésus après sa délivrance et son salut.  **\nMarc 5 verset 18 à 20   **\n18 « Et lorsqu'il fut monté dans la barque, celui qui avait été possédé du diable le pria d'être avec lui.\n19 Cependant Jésus ne le laissa pas souffrir, mais lui dit   Va chez tes amis, et dis-leur toutes les choses que le Seigneur a faites pour toi, et il a eu compassion de toi.\n20 Et il s'en alla, et se mit à publier dans la Décapole tout ce que Jésus avait fait pour lui, et tous s'en étonnèrent.  **\nJ'irais avec toi.\" Jésus lui a dit d'aller voir sa famille et ses amis et de leur dire ce que le Seigneur avait fait pour lui. Il a commencé en Décapole, une dizaine de villes, allant de lieu en lieu. Ceci est naturel pour chaque personne qui donne sa vie à Christ, y compris la femme. Les femmes ont le droit de prêcher Jésus, Sa Seigneurie et ce qu'Il a fait dans leur vie et chez les autres pour amener les hommes et les femmes à croire en Christ.  **\nLa femme de Samarie a amené plus de gens à Jésus par son témoignage. La femme a le droit de partager ses témoignages avec tous en tous lieux y compris la chaire de l'église.  **\n2.4 Marie Madeleine  **\nJean 20 verset 11 à 17   **\n11 «Mais Marie se tenait dehors au sépulcre en pleurant, et comme elle pleurait, elle se baissa et regarda dans le sépulcre,\n12 Et voit deux anges vêtus de blanc assis, l'un à la tête, et l'autre aux pieds, là où le corps de Jésus avait reposé.\n13 Et ils lui dirent   Femme, pourquoi pleures-tu ? Elle leur dit   Parce qu'ils ont enlevé mon Seigneur, et je ne sais où ils l'ont mis.\n14 Et ayant ainsi dit, elle se retourna, et vit Jésus debout, et ne sut pas que c'était Jésus.\n15 Jésus lui dit   Femme, pourquoi pleures-tu ? Qui cherches-tu ? Elle, pensant qu'il était le jardinier, lui dit   Seigneur, si tu l'as emporté d'ici, dis-moi où tu l'as mis, et je l'emporterai.\n16 Jésus lui dit   Marie. Elle se tourna et lui dit   Rabboni ; c'est-à-dire Maître.\n17 Jésus lui dit   Ne me touche pas ; car je ne suis pas encore monté vers mon Père, mais va vers mes frères, et dis-leur   Je monte vers mon Père et votre Père ; et à mon Dieu et votre Dieu.   **\nMarie ici, a reconnu la voix de Jésus et le Seigneur lui a donné une commission    **\nJean 20 verset 16 à 18   **\n16 Jésus lui dit   Marie. Elle se tourna et lui dit   Rabboni ; c'est-à-dire Maître.\n17 Jésus lui dit   Ne me touche pas ; car je ne suis pas encore monté vers mon Père, mais va vers mes frères, et dis-leur   Je monte vers mon Père et votre Père ; et à Mon Dieu, et votre Dieu.\n18 Marie de Magdala vint et dit aux disciples qu'elle avait vu le Seigneur, et qu'il lui avait dit ces choses.\n19 Alors le même jour, le soir, étant le premier jour de la semaine, quand les portes où les disciples étaient assemblés par crainte des Juifs étaient fermées, Jésus vint et se tint au milieu, et leur dit   Que la paix soit avec vous.\n20 Et quand il eut dit cela, il leur montra ses mains et son côté. Alors les disciples furent dans la joie lorsqu'ils virent le Seigneur.  **\n\"Allez vers mes frères.\" Notre Dieu ne peut-il pas donner le ministère à la femme ? Ici, le Seigneur a donné à la femme un message à prêcher aux hommes. Les apôtres se rassemblèrent pour l'entendre. Tant formellement qu'informellement, la femme a l'autorité du Christ pour prêcher. Tant en croisade qu'à l'église, la femme a l'autorité de Christ pour prêcher. La chose la plus importante est le message et non la plateforme. Chaque femme devrait le savoir et se tenir devant les hommes avec audace, mais humblement sans frisson et déclarer le message que le Seigneur lui a donné. La femme investie d'un ministère par le Seigneur doit aller de l'avant au nom du Seigneur et sous son autorité. Le Seigneur a commandé à Marie de Magdala   « Va vers mes frères et dis-leur. Il s'agit d'un appel ministériel et d'une commission que la femme chrétienne a reçue pour prêcher l'évangile de toutes les manières, sur toutes les plateformes, y compris la chaire. Elle est libre d'utiliser les illustrations et les méthodes qui permettront aux gens de la comprendre. Marie a été chargée d'un message à prêcher aux frères dans «l'église».  **\n\"Là où deux ou trois sont réunis en mon nom, je suis là avec eux\", et c'est une église. La femme peut y prêcher si Christ lui donne un message. Le message donné à Marie-Madeleine n'était pas une prophétie au sens du don de prophétie. C'était une instruction directe, \"Allez vers mes frères.\" Ses frères étaient assis quelque part. Ainsi, dans l'église, les femmes peuvent prêcher. Les gens peuvent s'asseoir et elle est là pour leur prêcher, parce qu'elle a le message de Dieu et l'autorité pour le faire. Celui qui la reçoit reçoit le Seigneur et celui qui la rejette, rejette le Seigneur qui lui a donné le message et la commission.  **\nMatthieu 10 verset 40   **\nCelui qui vous reçoit me reçoit, et celui qui me reçoit reçoit celui qui m'a envoyé.  **\nLuc 10 verset 16\nCelui qui vous écoute m'écoute; et celui qui vous méprise me méprise; et celui qui me méprise méprise celui qui m'a envoyé.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 4 verset 8 Celui donc qui méprise, ne méprise pas l'homme, mais Dieu, qui nous a aussi donné son Esprit Saint.  **\n2.5 Prophétesse Anna  **\nIl y a aussi le cas d'Anne, dans le Nouveau Testament, qui s'est donnée à la prière et à l'intercession, servant dans le temple.  **\nLuc 2 verset 36 à 38   **\n36 Et il y avait une Anne, une prophétesse, la fille de Phanuel, de la tribu d'Aser   elle était d'un grand âge, et avait vécu avec un mari sept ans depuis sa virginité ;\n37 Et elle était une veuve d'environ quatre-vingt-quatre ans, qui ne quittait pas le temple, mais servait Dieu avec des jeûnes et des prières nuit et jour.\n38 Et elle, venant à cet instant, rendit également grâces au Seigneur, et parla de lui à tous ceux qui attendaient la rédemption à Jérusalem.  **\nIci, nous voyons qu'elle a parlé de Jésus à tous (hommes et femmes) qui attendaient la rédemption en Israël. Elle s'est engagée dans la prière et l'intercession, avec des jeûnes pendant de nombreuses années. Certes, elle en a encouragé beaucoup à s'impliquer dans ce ministère. Elle a certainement recruté et organisé d'autres personnes pour prier pour le réveil de Dieu en Israël. Elle l'a vu venir dans l'enfant Jésus qu'elle a eu le privilège de cailler dans ses bras. La prière et l'intercession sont un ministère dans lequel les femmes peuvent être encouragées. La Bible dit   « Vous ferez de plus grandes œuvres que celle-ci » (hommes et femmes) « parce que je vais à mon Père ».  **\nJean 14 verset 12 ;   **\nEn vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, celui qui croit en moi, il fera aussi les oeuvres que je fais; et il fera des oeuvres plus grandes que celles-ci; car je vais à mon Père.  **\nCette promesse est faite aux hommes et aux femmes en Christ.  **\n2.6 Les Quatre Filles de Philippe l'Évangéliste  **\nActes 21 verset 8 à 9   **\n8 Et le lendemain, nous qui étions de la compagnie de Paul, nous partîmes, et nous allâmes à Césarée ; et nous entrâmes dans la maison de Philippe l'évangéliste, qui était l'une des sept; et demeura avec lui.\n9 Et le même homme avait quatre filles, vierges, qui prophétisaient.  **\nDans cette Écriture, nous voyons les quatre filles de Philippe prophétiser. Ils servaient tous les membres de l'assemblée, hommes et femmes. C'est Dieu qui leur a donné une place dans le ministère de leur père. Ils ont travaillé avec leur père pour promouvoir l'œuvre de Dieu. Possédant le don de prophétie, ils parlaient dans l'église chaque fois que Dieu leur donnait un message.  **\n2.7 Les femmes dans le ministère enseignant  **\nIl y a aussi l'enseignement de la parole que les femmes pourraient aussi participer à faire parmi le peuple de Dieu. Nous devons apprendre à comparer les Écritures avec les Écritures afin de comprendre la pensée de Dieu.  **\nActes 18 verset 24 à 28,   **\n24 Et un Juif nommé Apollos, né à Alexandrie, homme éloquent et puissant dans les Écritures, vint à Éphèse.\n25 Cet homme était instruit dans la voie du Seigneur ; et étant fervent dans l'esprit, il parlait et enseignait avec diligence les choses du Seigneur, ne connaissant que le baptême de Jean.\n26 Et il se mit à parler hardiment dans la synagogue, qu'Aquila et Priscille ayant entendue, ils le prirent avec eux, et lui exposèrent plus parfaitement la voie de Dieu.\n27 Et quand il fut disposé à passer en Achaïe, les frères écrivirent, exhortant les disciples à le recevoir ; qui, quand il fut venu, les a beaucoup aidés qui avaient cru par grâce  \n28 Car il a puissamment convaincu les Juifs, et cela publiquement, montrant par les Ecritures que Jésus était le Christ.  **\nNous pouvons voir ici que lorsque Aquila et Pricilla sa femme ont écouté Apollos, ils ont compris qu'il ne savait pas grand-chose de Jésus, bien qu'il parlait avec zèle. Les deux se sont impliqués dans l'enseignement à Apollos de la vérité sur Jésus. Apollos n'oublierait pas leur double ministère sur sa vie par la volonté de Dieu. Grâce à eux, Apollos est devenu un vaisseau utile dans la main de Dieu. Si des femmes enseignent dans des écoles laïques, qu'est-ce qui empêche une femme chrétienne bien instruite d'enseigner dans une école biblique et dans l'église ? (Où deux ou trois sont réunis au nom de Jésus). Il n'y a pas beaucoup de différence entre prêcher et enseigner. Ils visent tous deux à communiquer des connaissances et à comprendre. Si une femme est libre de prêcher, qu'est-ce qui l'empêche d'enseigner ? Elle est chargée d'enseigner aussi.   **\nTite 2 verset 1 à 5   **\n1 Mais dis les choses qui conviennent à la saine doctrine ;\n2 Que les vieillards soient sobres, graves, tempérés, sains de foi, de charité, de patience.\n3 Les femmes âgées de même, afin qu'elles se conduisent comme il convient à la sainteté, non de faux accusateurs, peu portées à beaucoup de vin, enseignantes de bonnes choses ;\n4 Afin qu'elles apprennent aux jeunes filles à être sobres, à aimer leur mari, à aimer leurs enfants,\n5 Etre prudentes, chastes, gardiennes de la maison, bonnes, obéissantes à leurs propres maris, afin que la parole de Dieu ne soit pas blasphémée.  **\nSi la femme est libre de prêcher aussi aux hommes comme le montre l'Écriture, elle est certainement libre aussi d'enseigner aux hommes. Cette Écriture ne limite certainement pas son ministère d'enseignement aux femmes seulement. Si nous prenons cette écriture littéralement sans compréhension spirituelle, nous interdirons à la femme d'enseigner aux enfants ou aux jeunes, en particulier les hommes. Nous voyons donc ici que dans tout ce qu'un homme fait, sa femme doit le suivre et l'aider. L'Écriture dit qu'il a fait de la femme une aide appropriée pour l'homme. Un homme avec un ministère d'enseignement qui a élevé sa femme dans une bonne compréhension des Écritures, ne fait pas de mal à Dieu de faire en sorte que sa femme enseigne avec lui dans le ministère.  **\nLorsque le mari fait l'œuvre de Dieu, la femme ne doit pas croiser les bras et dire que je ne suis qu'une femme. Elle doit l'aider de toutes les manières possibles. Le mari conduit souvent la voiture, la femme peut aussi apprendre à conduire de sorte que lorsqu'il est faible ou que quelque chose l'empêche de conduire, la femme prend le relais pour l'aider à poursuivre le voyage.     **\n2.8 Mari et femme dans le ministère  **\nIl y a beaucoup d'hommes de Dieu aujourd'hui qui ont réussi dans le ministère de l'évangile en employant l'aide de leurs femmes dans le ministère.  **\n1 Corinthiens 9 verset 5   **\nN'avons-nous pas le pouvoir de conduire une sœur, une femme, ainsi que d'autres apôtres, et les frères du Seigneur, et Céphas ?  **\nPaul dit ici que Pierre, Jacques et Jude étaient mariés et se déplaçaient avec leurs femmes pour jouer leurs rôles à leurs côtés dans le ministère. La parole de Dieu dit   « Je lui ferai une aide digne de ce nom.  **\nGenèse 2 verset 18   **\nEt l'Éternel Dieu dit  Il n'est pas bon que l'homme soit seul; Je lui ferai une aide pour lui.  **\nToute femme qui peut fonctionner dans le ministère chrétien de son mari doit être née de nouveau et humble d'esprit. Elle ne doit pas usurper l'autorité de son mari dans le ministère. Elle doit maintenir ses dons et sa vocation.  **\nCependant, il y a des ministres qui utilisent les premiers Corinthiens 9 verset 5 ci-dessus pour inviter une sœur célibataire ou une sœur mariée à aller avec eux pour le ministère dans d'autres endroits. Tu es une femme; un homme vous invite à aller avec lui à une croisade et vous acceptez d'aller avec lui tous parce qu'il est votre pasteur. Êtes-vous, sa femme? Vous devriez savoir que vous allez avec lui pour l'immoralité. Dieu respecte la décence. C'est pourquoi la sagesse doit être exercée dans le ministère lorsqu'il s'agit du sexe opposé. Il faut faire preuve de prudence et de prudence, sinon vous deviendrez des ministres de Satan. Ne laissez aucune femme se laisser maltraiter à cause du ministère. Que le pasteur parte pour cette croisade avec sa femme et non avec une sœur, sauf que c'est une sensibilisation de groupe impliquant plusieurs personnes. Ne faites pas de mal de votre zèle dans le ministère, et ne donnez pas une place au diable. Tenez compte des instructions scripturaires  **\nPremiers Corinthiens 8 verset 20, 21   **\n20 Evitant ceci, afin que personne ne nous blâme dans cette abondance que nous administrons  \n21 Pourvoir aux choses honnêtes, non seulement devant le Seigneur, mais aussi devant les hommes.  **\nSi la femme du pasteur n'est pas croyante ou est indisposée, il doit rechercher la face de Dieu et les conseils des vrais serviteurs de Dieu pour la compagnie dans le ministère.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 3  **\nJUSTIFICATION SCRIPTURALE POUR LE MINISTERE DES FEMMES  **\nLa prédication, l'enseignement, la prière ou la prophétie par des femmes dans le ministère sont justifiés par Dieu selon les écritures suivantes   **\ni)\tRomains 15 verset 4   **\n4 Car tout ce qui a été écrit auparavant l'a été pour notre instruction, afin que nous ayons l'espérance, par la patience et la consolation des Écritures  **\nLe ministère des femmes était pratiqué dans les Écritures comme nous l'avons vu. Le ministère de la femme reste valable jusqu'à ce jour. La prophétie de l'Écriture a montré que les femmes pieuses devraient être impliquées dans le ministère de l'Évangile au temps de la fin, qui est notre temps. Par conséquent, le ministère dans lequel nous voyons des femmes pieuses engagées aujourd'hui est celui du Saint-Esprit, à l'exception de ceux des femmes indisciplinées et impies, qui sont connus par leurs fruits.  **\nii)\tJoël 2 verset 28,29   **\n28 Et il arrivera après que je répandrai mon esprit sur toute chair ; et vos fils et vos filles prophétiseront, vos vieillards rêveront des songes, vos jeunes gens verront des visions; 29 Et aussi sur les serviteurs et sur les servantes, en ces jours-là, je répandrai mon esprit.\niii)\tActes 1 verset 8   **\nMais vous recevrez une puissance, après que le Saint-Esprit sera venu sur vous, et vous serez mes témoins à Jérusalem, et dans toute la Judée, et à Samarie, et jusqu'à l'extrémité de la terre.  **\nLe Seigneur a envoyé le baptême du Saint-Esprit sur ses fils et ses filles pour rendre un témoignage efficace (prédicateurs, enseignants, ouvriers). Les femmes reçoivent également le baptême du Saint-Esprit et doivent s'engager dans tout ministère que le Seigneur leur confie pour le salut humain et l'établissement des saints.   **\niv)\tCorinthiens 12 verset 1 à 11   **\n1 En ce qui concerne les dons spirituels, frères, je ne voudrais pas que vous soyez ignorants. 2 Vous savez que vous étiez des Gentils, entraînés vers ces idoles muettes, comme vous avez été conduits.\n3 C'est pourquoi je vous fais comprendre que personne, parlant par l'Esprit de Dieu, n'appelle Jésus maudit; et que personne ne peut dire que Jésus est le Seigneur, si ce n'est par le Saint-Esprit.\n4 Or il y a diversité de dons, mais le même Esprit. 5Et il y a des différences d'administrations, mais le même Seigneur.\n6 Et il y a diversité d'opérations, mais c'est le même Dieu qui opère tout en tous.\n7 Mais la manifestation de l'Esprit est donnée à chacun pour son profit.\n8 Car à l'un est donnée par l'Esprit la parole de sagesse; à un autre la parole de connaissance par le même Esprit ;\n9 A une autre foi par le même Esprit ; à un autre les dons de guérison par le même Esprit ;\n10 A un autre l'accomplissement de miracles ; à une autre prophétie; à un autre discernement des esprits ; à un autre divers genres de langues ; à un autre l'interprétation des langues  \n11 Mais tout cela opère par un seul et même Esprit, distribuant à chacun en particulier comme il veut.  **\nIci, les dons de l'Esprit sont donnés pour le ministère dans le corps de Christ. Les femmes chrétiennes jouissent aussi de ces dons par lesquels elles édifient les saints. Des signes suivent le ministère de la femme au nom de Jésus.  **\nv)\tMarc 16 verset 17 à 20   **\n17 Et voici les miracles qui accompagneront ceux qui auront cru ; En mon nom, ils chasseront les démons ; ils parleront de nouvelles langues;\n18 Ils prendront des serpents; et s'ils boivent quelque chose de mortel, cela ne leur fera pas de mal; ils imposeront les mains aux malades, et ils seront guéris.\n19 Ainsi donc, après que le Seigneur leur eut parlé, il fut élevé au ciel et s'assit à la droite de Dieu.\n20 Et ils sortirent et prêchèrent partout, le Seigneur agissant avec eux et confirmant la parole par des miracles. Amen.  **\n\nCes choses se voient pratiquement parmi nous. Tout cela confirme que la femme a pleinement accès au ministère chrétien par la volonté de Dieu. Les signes et les errances suivent le ministère au nom de Jésus. Le Seigneur lui-même travaille avec eux pour confirmer leur parole par des signes qui suivent. Cela sert à justifier le ministère.  **\nvi)\tMatthieu 28 verset 19, 20   **\n19 Allez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit ;\n20 Enseignez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai prescrit ; et voici, je suis toujours avec vous, même jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amen.  **\nL'instruction du Seigneur dans cette Écriture n'implique pas seulement de prêcher aux pécheurs, mais d'enseigner les saints. Puisque les femmes sont incluses dans les disciples du Christ, elles sont incluses dans la commission de prêcher et d'enseigner aux convertis toute la parole de Dieu.  **\nPar cette commission, ils ont l'autorité du Christ pour enseigner aux hommes et aux femmes du monde entier le message de l'Évangile et les doctrines scripturaires. S'ils le font fidèlement, ils verront la présence et les bénédictions de Jésus dans leur ministère. Cette commission contient également le commandement de baptiser les convertis dans l'eau au nom du Père et du Fils et du Saint-Esprit. Les femmes ministres ont l'autorité du Seigneur pour baptiser les convertis. Là où les femmes ministres ne baptisent pas les convertis ni ne servent la communion aux fidèles, c'est la doctrine de l'église ou de la dénomination qui les limite, pas la parole de Dieu. Les ouvriers de la moisson du Seigneur sont peu nombreux. Les femmes croyantes font partie des ouvriers que le Seigneur a recrutés pour son service.  **\nMatthieu 9 verset 37, 38   **\n37 Alors il dit à ses disciples   La moisson est vraiment abondante, mais les ouvriers sont peu nombreux ;\n38 Priez donc le maître de la moisson, qu'il envoie des ouvriers dans sa moisson.\nvii)\tDieu est glorifié par le ministère des femmes dans l'Église et dans le monde.  **\n1 Corinthiens 10 verset 31   **\nSoit donc que vous mangiez, soit que vous buviez, ou quoi que vous fassiez, faites tout pour la gloire de Dieu.  **\nRomains 14 verset 4,\n10 Qui es-tu, toi qui juges le serviteur d'un autre homme ? à son propre maître il se tient debout ou tombe. Oui, il sera soutenu, car Dieu est capable de le faire tenir debout. 10 Mais pourquoi juges-tu ton frère ? ou pourquoi méprises-tu ton frère ? car nous nous tiendrons tous devant le siège du jugement de Christ.\n11 Car il est écrit   Aussi vivant que je sois, dit le Seigneur, tout genou fléchira devant moi, et toute langue confessera à Dieu.\n12 Ainsi chacun de nous rendra compte à Dieu pour lui-même.\n13 Ne nous jugeons donc plus les uns les autres, mais jugeons plutôt ceci, que personne ne met une pierre d'achoppement ou une occasion de tomber sur le chemin de son frère.\n14 Je sais, et je suis persuadé par le Seigneur Jésus, qu'il n'y a rien d'impur en soi ; mais pour celui qui considère qu'une chose est impure, pour lui elle est impure.\n15 Mais si ton frère est attristé par ta nourriture, maintenant tu ne marches pas avec charité. Ne le détruis pas avec ta viande, pour qui Christ est mort.\n16 Qu'on ne parle donc pas mal de votre bien ;\n17 Car le royaume de Dieu n'est pas nourriture et boisson; mais la justice, et la paix, et la joie dans le Saint-Esprit.\n18 Car celui qui sert Christ en ces choses est agréable à Dieu et approuvé des hommes. 19 Recherchons donc les choses qui font la paix, et celles dont l'un peut édifier l'autre.  **\n\nAucune restriction ne doit être imposée aux femmes dans le ministère. Les disciples ont interdit aux enfants de venir à Jésus et il les a réprimandés pour une telle action injuste. Il voulait que les enfants viennent à lui et soient bénis par lui. De même, qu'aucun homme ou dénomination n'empêche la femme par la tradition ou la doctrine de s'engager dans le ministère de l'Évangile parmi les saints, qu'ils soient hommes ou femmes dans la congrégation. Le Seigneur est mécontent de cela.  **\nTroisième Jean 9 à 11   **\n9 J'ai écrit à l'Église, mais Diotrèphe, qui aime avoir la prééminence parmi eux, ne nous reçoit pas.  **\nTroisième Jean 1 à 10   **\nC'est pourquoi, si je viens, je me souviendrai des actes qu'il a commis, racontant contre nous des paroles malveillantes, et ne s'en contentant pas, il ne reçoit pas non plus lui-même les frères, et interdit ceux qui le voudraient, et les chasse hors de l'Église.  **\nTroisième Jean 1 à 11   **\nBien-aimés, ne suivez pas ce qui est mal, mais ce qui est bien. Celui qui fait le bien est de Dieu, mais celui qui fait le mal n'a pas vu Dieu.  **\nHébreux 1 à 1   **\n1 Dieu, qui à plusieurs reprises et de diverses manières a autrefois parlé aux pères par les prophètes.  **\nHébreux 2 verset 1 à 4   **\n1 C'est pourquoi nous devons prêter une plus grande attention aux choses que nous avons entendues, de peur qu'à aucun moment nous ne les laissions échapper.\n2 Car si la parole prononcée par les anges était constante, et que toute transgression et désobéissance recevait une juste récompense de récompense ;\n3 Comment échapperons-nous, si nous négligeons un si grand salut ? qui a d'abord commencé à être prononcée par le Seigneur, et nous a été confirmée par ceux qui l'ont entendu ;\n4 Dieu leur rendait-il aussi témoignage par des signes et des prodiges, et par divers miracles et dons du Saint-Esprit, selon sa propre volonté ?  **\nDieu parle de diverses manières à son peuple. L'une des façons dont Il parle aux hommes est par vision ou révélation. Le Seigneur est aveugle dans le choix de Ses messagers. Il utilise des enfants, des femmes et des hommes pour communiquer son message de salut. Beaucoup d'entre nous sont témoins du fait que Dieu a transmis de grands messages de révélation à travers les femmes à l'église et au monde dans notre génération. Ces messages de révélation sont bibliques et conduisent les hommes et les femmes au salut, à la sainteté et au service fidèle. Certains de ces messages de révélation impliquent la mort ou des expériences de mort imminente. Ces messages de révélation accélèrent les vérités scripturaires et les doctrines qui sont ignorées ou oubliées par l'église. Ceux qui vérifient ces révélations par les Écritures et croient qu'elles viennent de Dieu sont ravivés, édifiés et établis dans le Seigneur. Si Dieu envoie une femme avec un message pour vous en tant qu'individu, ne le recevrez-vous pas ? Si Dieu l'envoie à l'église, ne lui donneront-ils pas la plate-forme pour la délivrer ? Que la femme qui a la parole de Dieu en témoigne, la prêche, l'enseigne, la chante pour le salut de l'homme et l'entrée au ciel.   **\nEzéchiel 40 verset 1 à 4   **\n1 La vingt-cinquième année de notre captivité, au commencement de l'année, le dixième jour du mois, la quatorzième année après que la ville eut été frappée, le même jour la main de l'Éternel était sur moi, et m'a amené là-bas.\n2 Dans les visions de Dieu, il m'a amené dans le pays d'Israël, et m'a placé sur une très haute montagne, qui était comme la charpente d'une ville au midi.\n3 Et il m'amena là, et voici, il y avait un homme, dont l'apparence était comme l'apparence de l'airain, avec une corde de lin dans sa main, et un roseau de mesure ; et il se tint à la porte.\n4 Et l'homme me dit   Fils de l'homme, regarde de tes yeux, et écoute de tes oreilles, et fixe ton cœur sur tout ce que je te montrerai ; car c'est dans l'intention que je te les montre que tu es amené ici. Raconte tout ce que tu vois à la maison d'Israël.  **\nApocalypse 3 verset 22   **\nQue celui qui a des oreilles entende ce que l'Esprit dit aux Églises  **\n\n\n\nCHAPITRE 4 **\nCLARIFICATIONS SCRIPTURAIRES  **\n4.1 Direction  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 1 à 6   **\n1 Soyez mes disciples, comme moi aussi je suis de Christ.\n2 Maintenant je vous loue, frères, de vous souvenir de moi en toutes choses, et de garder les ordonnances, comme je vous les ai données.\n3 Mais je voudrais que vous sachiez que le chef de tout homme, c'est Christ ; et le chef de la femme est l'homme; et le chef de Christ est Dieu.\n4 Tout homme qui prie ou prophétise, la tête couverte, déshonore sa tête.\n5 Mais toute femme qui prie ou prophétise la tête découverte déshonore sa tête, car c'est même une seule comme si elle était rasée. 6 Car si la femme n'est pas couverte, qu'elle soit aussi tondue, mais s'il est honteux pour une femme d'être tondue ou rasée, qu'elle soit couverte.   **\nCette Écriture présente trois types de direction.  **\n4.2 La direction de Dieu sur Christ.  **\nBien que Christ soit Dieu et soit un avec Dieu, Il a laissé Sa forme de Dieu dans la pleine gloire et autorité dans le ciel et est venu sur terre sous la forme d'un homme. Il est venu comme serviteur, messager et a été appelé le Fils de Dieu. Par conséquent, Dieu qui l'a envoyé est son chef Philippiens 2 versets 6, 7. Sur terre, il a montré une soumission totale au Père. Il cherchait la gloire de Dieu parmi les hommes et non sa propre gloire. Il obéissait au Père, faisant tout ce qui Lui plaisait  **\nJean 5 verset 30   **\n30 Je ne peux rien faire de moi-même; comme j'entends, je juge, et mon jugement est juste ; car je ne cherche pas ma volonté, mais la volonté du Père qui m'a envoyé.  **\nJean 15 verset 10   **\n10 Si vous gardez mes commandements, vous demeurerez dans mon amour ; de même que j'ai gardé les commandements de mon Père et que je demeure dans son amour.  **\nJean 17 verset 4   **\n4 Je t'ai glorifié sur la terre; J'ai achevé l'œuvre que tu m'as donnée à faire.  **\nCes textes montrent la subordination du Christ au Père.  **\n4.3 La direction de Christ sur l'homme  **\nJésus-Christ est le chef de l'homme. Il est le chef et le maître de l'homme.    **\nEphésiens 1 verset 22, 23   **\n22 et il a tout mis sous ses pieds, et l'a donné pour être le chef de l'Église sur toutes choses,\n23 qui est son corps, la plénitude de celui qui remplit tout en tous.  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 23   **\nCar le mari est le chef de la femme, tout comme Christ est le chef de l'église et il est le Sauveur du corps.  **\nNous nous soumettons tous à Christ. Nous ne cherchons pas notre gloire, mais la gloire de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. Nous lui obéissons sans discuter.  **\n4.4 La direction de l'homme sur la femme.  **\nL'homme prend la tête de la femme. La direction de l'homme sur la femme est donnée à trois égards   **\n4.5 Dans Création.  **\nLorsque Dieu a créé l'homme et la femme, Il a donné la direction à l'homme qui a été créé le premier.  **\nGenèse 3 verset 16   **\nIl dit à la femme   Je multiplierai grandement ta douleur et ta conception ; dans la douleur tu enfanteras des enfants; et ton désir sera pour ton mari, et il dominera sur toi.  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 9   **\nL'homme n'a pas non plus été créé pour la femme; mais la femme pour l'homme.  **\nDans les affaires civiles du monde entier, les êtres humains de toutes les traditions comprennent que l'homme est le chef de la femme.  **\n4.6 Dans le mariage et la famille  **\nLe Dieu qui a institué le mariage et la famille a clairement indiqué que l'homme est le chef de sa femme et de la famille. La femme doit lui être soumise et lui obéir en tout ce qui ne contredit pas la parole de Dieu.  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 22 à 24   **\n22 Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme au Seigneur.\n23 Car le mari est le chef de la femme, comme Christ est le chef de l'Église et il est le Sauveur du corps.\n24 C'est pourquoi, comme l'Église est soumise à Christ, ainsi que les femmes soient en toutes choses à leurs maris.  **\n4.7 Dans l'Église  **\nCette direction de l'homme sur la femme se reflète également dans l'église, tout comme la direction de Christ sur l'homme.  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 4 à 7   **\n4 Tout homme qui prie ou prophétise, la tête couverte, déshonore sa tête.\n5 Mais toute femme qui prie ou prophétise la tête découverte déshonore sa tête, car c'est même une seule comme si elle était rasée.\n6 Car si la femme n'est pas couverte, qu'elle soit aussi tondue, mais s'il est honteux pour une femme d'être tondue ou rasée, qu'elle soit couverte.\n7 En effet, l'homme ne doit pas se couvrir la tête, car il est l'image et la gloire de Dieu, mais la femme est la gloire de l'homme.  **\nParce que Christ est le chef de l'homme, pendant le culte (c'est-à-dire la prière, la prophétie, la prédication et l'enseignement de la parole de Dieu), l'homme doit laisser sa tête nue sans la couvrir d'un morceau de tissu, d'une casquette ou d'un chapeau. Sa tête nue doit être vue. C'est un symbolisme physique de la présence et de la gloire du Christ, Chef, Chef et Sauveur. Pendant cette période également, les femmes doivent se couvrir la tête avec un couvre-chef matériel pour montrer dans un sens physique que l'homme n'est pas à la tête et que sa gloire doit être couverte à ce moment car l'homme est le chef de la femme et la femme est la gloire de l'homme. Faire autrement comme pratiqué dans certains lieux de culte est contraire à l'Écriture. Cependant, se couvrir la tête par une femme n'est pas une chose à faire en tout temps et en tout lieu. Il n'est observé que lors des sessions formelles d'adoration à Dieu et dans ses prières à Dieu.  **\n4.8 Laissons les femmes se taire  **\n1 Corinthiens 14 verset 33 à 40   **\nCar Dieu n'est pas l'auteur de la confusion, mais de la paix, comme dans toutes les églises des saints.\n34 Que vos femmes se taisent dans les églises ; car il ne leur est pas permis de parler ; mais il leur est commandé d'être soumis, comme le dit aussi la loi.\n35 Et si elles veulent apprendre quelque chose, qu'elles interrogent leurs maris à la maison ; car c'est une honte pour les femmes de parler dans l'église.\n36 Quoi ? la parole de Dieu est-elle sortie de vous ? ou est-il arrivé à toi seul ?\n37 Si quelqu'un se croit prophète ou spirituel, qu'il reconnaisse que les choses que je vous écris sont les commandements du Seigneur.\n38 Mais si quelqu'un est ignorant, qu'il soit ignorant. 39 C'est pourquoi, frères, convoitez de prophétiser, et n'interdisez pas de parler en langues.\n40 Que tout se fasse décemment et dans l'ordre.   **\nDans notre étude jusqu'à présent, nous avons compris par les écritures que les femmes sont autorisées par le Christ à faire ce qui suit  **\ni)\tPrêchez l'Evangile en tant que disciple du Christ.  **\nMarc 16 verset 15   **\nEt il leur dit   Allez par tout le monde, et prêchez l'Evangile à toute créature.\nii)\tEnseignez la parole de Dieu aux convertis en tant que gagneurs d'âmes  **\nMatthieu 28 verset 18 à 20   **\n18 Et Jésus, s'approchant, leur parla, disant   Tout pouvoir m'a été donné dans le ciel et sur la terre.\n19 Allez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit  \n20 Enseignez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai prescrit. Et voici, je suis avec vous pour toujours, jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amen.  **\niii)\tTémoignent des œuvres de Dieu dans leur vie et dans la vie des autres en Christ.  **\nPsaume 107 verset 2   **\nQue disent ainsi les rachetés de l'Éternel, qu'il a rachetés de la main de l'ennemi  **\niv)\tChantez dans l'adoration de Dieu dans l'église.  **\n Ephésiens 5 verset 19, 20   **\nParlant à vous-mêmes par des psaumes, des hymnes et des chants spirituels, chantant et chantant dans votre cœur au Seigneur ;\n20 Rendez toujours grâces pour toutes choses à Dieu et le Père au nom de notre Seigneur Jésus Christ;  **\nv)\tProphétise   parle aux hommes pour leur édification, leur exhortation et leur réconfort  **\n\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 5   **\nMais toute femme qui prie ou prophétise la tête découverte déshonore sa tête, car c'est même une seule comme si elle était rasée.\nMais celui qui prophétise parle aux hommes d'édification, d'exhortation et de consolation.  **\nActes 21 verset 8, 9   **\n8 Et le lendemain, nous qui étions de la compagnie de Paul, nous partîmes, et nous allâmes à Césarée, et nous entrâmes dans la maison de Philippe l'évangéliste, qui était l'une des sept ; et demeura avec lui.\n9 Et le même homme avait quatre filles, vierges, qui prophétisaient.  **\nToutes ces activités impliquent de parler et de parler. Les femmes ont l'autorité scripturaire pour parler à ces égards dans l'église. En comparant les écritures avec les écritures, le sens des textes scripturaires prend vie et les interprétations erronées et les confusions sont supprimées.  **\n1 Corinthiens 2 verset 13   **\nCe que nous disons aussi, non pas dans les paroles que la sagesse humaine enseigne, mais dans celles que le Saint-Esprit enseigne ; comparant les choses spirituelles avec spirituelles.  **\n4.9 Comprendre le texte  **\nLorsque nous considérons le texte intégral où cette instruction est donnée, nous verrons ce qui suit  \ni.\tDieu n'est pas l'auteur de la confusion, mais de la paix.\nii.\tQue la femme garde le silence dans l'église\niii.\tIl ne leur est pas permis de parler\niv.\tIl leur est commandé d'être sous l'obéissance, comme le dit aussi la loi\nv.\tv. Si elles apprennent quelque chose, qu'elles demandent à leurs maris à la maison\nvi.\tC'est une honte pour les femmes de parler dans l'église\nvii.\tC'est le commandement de Dieu\nviii.\tIl ne faut pas interdire aux femmes de parler en langues dans l'église\nix.\tQue tout soit fait décemment et dans l'ordre  **\nConsidérant les droits scripturaires que Dieu a donnés à la femme chrétienne pour parler, prêcher, enseigner, prophétiser dans l'église, nous savons que ce n'est pas à ces égards  **\nI Corinthiens 14 verset 34, 35 parle de; car l'Écriture n'est pas divisée contre elle-même. Ce n'est donc pas à ces égards que premier Corinthiens 14 verset 34,35 dit     **\ni.\tLa femme doit garder le silence dans l'église\nii.\tIl ne leur est pas permis de parler\niii.\tC'est une honte pour la femme de parler dans l'église  **\n4.10 Le problème causé par les femmes dans l'Église  **\nNous voyons dans les déclarations suivantes du texte, le problème que les femmes ont causé dans l'église.  **\ni.\tConfusion parmi les frères.\nii.\tDésobéissance à l'autorité des hommes\niii.\tInsubordination au leadership\niv.\tIndécence et désordre.  **\nCe sont des actes d'impiété qui ont justifié le commandement donné aux femmes dans ce passage. Cette interdiction n'est certainement pas la règle dans toutes les assemblées. Ces règles ne sont pas inconditionnelles. Là où il y a de la vérité, de la droiture et de la sainteté chez les femmes, ces règles ne sont certainement pas applicables. Mais dans toute congrégation où les femmes sont désobéissantes, indisciplinées et font preuve d'insubordination et d'ingérence indue dans les affaires civiles et administratives de l'église, ces règles s'appliquent. Le fonctionnement libre et sans entrave de la femme dans l'église exige son engagement total envers la vérité scripturaire et la droiture et la sainteté pratiques.  **\n2 Timothée 1 verset 9, 10.   **\nSachant ceci, que la loi n'est pas faite pour le juste, mais pour les impies, pour les impies et pour les pécheurs, pour les impies et les profanes, pour les meurtriers de pères et les meurtriers de mères, pour les meurtriers,\n10 Pour les impudiques, pour ceux qui se souillent avec les hommes, pour les voleurs d'hommes, pour les menteurs, pour les parjures, et s'il y a autre chose qui est contraire à la saine doctrine.  **\nDes femmes comme Deborah, Huldah et Priscilla n'auront pas besoin que ces règles leur soient imposées parce qu'elles connaissaient bien la droiture et la sainteté requises d'elles et sont assez humbles pour ne pas sous-estimer l'autorité des hommes. Dans une congrégation où les femmes ne sont pas données à la justice et à la sainteté, ces règles doivent être appliquées pour les empêcher de détruire l'église par leur zèle charnel et leur ingérence injuste. Beaucoup de femmes deviennent émotives et n'ont pas le courage d'affronter les problèmes de péché et de rébellion dans l'église comme le font les hommes. Ce contrôle est nécessaire sur ceux-ci pour garder l'église paisible et juste.  **\n4.11 Je ne souffre pas qu'une femme enseigne  **\nPremier Timothée 2 verset 11 à 15   **\n11 Que la femme apprenne en silence avec toute soumission.\n12 Mais je ne permets pas à une femme d'enseigner, ni d'usurper l'autorité sur l'homme, mais de se taire. 13 Car Adam a été formé le premier, puis Eve.\n14 Et Adam n'a pas été trompé, mais la femme trompée était dans la transgression.\n15 Néanmoins, elle sera sauvée dans la maternité, s'ils persévèrent dans la foi, la charité et la sainteté avec sobriété.  **\nNous devons à nouveau savoir que ce passage traite du cas de la désobéissance, de l'indiscipline et de l'insubordination de la femme à l'autorité divine placée sur elle. C'est une répétition de l'instruction donnée aux chrétiens corinthiens sur la nécessité d'exercer un contrôle sur les femmes impies. Le passage ci-dessus s'analyse comme suit    **\ni.\tLaisse la femme apprendre en silence\nii.\tQue la femme soit en toute sujétion\niii.\tJe ne permets pas à la femme d'enseigner\niv.\tJe ne permets pas à la femme d'usurper l'autorité sur l'homme\nv.\tMais elle doit être en silence\nvi.\tAdam a été formé avant Eve\nvii.\tAdam ne s'est pas trompé\nviii.\tLa femme a été trompée\nix.\tElle a apporté le péché sur Adam  **\nC'est pourquoi Dieu permet la souffrance dans la procréation   **\nGenèse 3 verset 16 Il dit à la femme   Je multiplierai beaucoup ta douleur et ta conception ; dans la douleur tu enfanteras des enfants; et ton désir sera pour ton mari, et il dominera sur toi.  **\nx.\tCependant, elle sera sauvée dans les enfants\nxi.\tQu'ils continuent dans la foi, la charité et la sainteté avec sobriété  **\nEn comparant Écriture avec Écriture, nous devrions savoir que le passage devant nous interdisant à la femme d'enseigner la parole de Dieu et lui ordonnant d'apprendre en silence n'est pas une Écriture absolue et inconditionnelle. Comme le montrent déjà les Écritures, la femme a le droit de prophétiser   parler aux autres pour leur édification, leur exhortation et leur réconfort. En tant que disciple du Christ, elle reçoit l'autorité de prêcher l'évangile à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur de l'église partout dans le monde. Celui qui prêche entre souvent dans l'enseignement sans le savoir parce que les deux vont ensemble. En tant que personne autorisée à faire des disciples, la femme chrétienne est également autorisée à leur apprendre à observer tout ce que le Seigneur a commandé dans l'Écriture. Elle est également spécifiquement commandée d'enseigner aux femmes chrétiennes sur les questions de justice et de sainteté.  **\nTite 2 verset 3, 4  **\n3 Les femmes âgées de même, afin qu'elles se conduisent comme il convient à la sainteté, non de faux accusateurs, peu portées à beaucoup de vin, enseignantes de bonnes choses ;\n4 Afin qu'elles apprennent aux jeunes femmes à être sobres, à aimer leurs maris, à aimer leurs enfants,  **\nPuisque l'Écriture ne se contredit pas, nous devons chercher à savoir ce que ce passage scripturaire cherche à accomplir dans la vie des femmes chrétiennes.  **\n4.12 Raison de la chute de l'Homme dans le Jardin  **\nGenèse 3 verset 1 à 12   **\n1 Or le serpent était plus rusé que toutes les bêtes des champs que l'Éternel Dieu avait faites. Et il dit à la femme   Oui, Dieu a-t-il dit   Vous ne mangerez pas de tous les arbres du jardin ?\n2 Et la femme dit au serpent   Nous pouvons manger du fruit des arbres du jardin ;\n3 Mais du fruit de l'arbre qui est au milieu du jardin, Dieu a dit   Vous n'en mangerez pas, et vous n'y toucherez pas, de peur que vous ne mouriez.\n4 Et le serpent dit à la femme   Vous ne mourrez certainement pas ;\n5 Car Dieu sait que le jour où vous en mangerez, vos yeux s'ouvriront, et vous serez comme des dieux, connaissant le bien et le mal.\n6 Et quand la femme vit que l'arbre était bon à manger, et qu'il était agréable aux yeux, et qu'il s'agissait d'un arbre à désirer pour rendre sage, elle prit de son fruit, et en mangea, et lui donna aussi mari avec elle; et il a mangé.\n7 Et leurs yeux à tous deux s'ouvrirent, et ils connurent qu'ils étaient nus ; et ils cousirent ensemble des feuilles de figuier, et se firent des tabliers.\n8 Et ils entendirent la voix de l'Éternel Dieu marchant dans le jardin dans la fraîcheur du jour ; et Adam et sa femme se cachèrent de devant l'Éternel Dieu parmi les arbres du jardin.\n9 Et l'Éternel Dieu appela Adam, et lui dit   Où es-tu ?\n10 Et il dit   J'ai entendu ta voix dans le jardin, et j'ai eu peur, parce que j'étais nu ; et je me suis caché.\n11 Et il dit   Qui t'a dit que tu étais nu ? As-tu mangé de l'arbre dont je t'avais commandé de ne pas manger? 12 Et l'homme dit   La femme que tu as donnée pour être avec moi, elle m'a donné de l'arbre, et j'en ai mangé.  **\nAdam a été formé dans la création avant la femme Eve. La personne qui a eu le dialogue avec le serpent était la femme. Satan craignait de ne pas réussir son stratagème s'il attaquait Adam. Il a trouvé des qualités naturelles chez Eve qui ont favorisé son stratagème. Quand il l'a engagée, il l'a trompée et inspirée pour impliquer Adam dans la désobéissance. Elle était donc responsable de la transgression. La cause étant qu'elle était en avant. Si elle avait compris et pratiqué la soumission à l'homme, la chute ne se serait pas produite. L'homme aurait résisté à Satan. Dans son ignorance, elle a « usurpé » la place de l'homme et effondré la race humaine. Elle a subi le jugement par le décret mis sur sa procréation.  **\n4.13 Prudence dans l'église  **\nLe Saint-Esprit ne permettrait pas que cette scène se répète dans l'église. La femme doit être correctement contrôlée et supervisée afin qu'elle n'introduise pas le péché dans l'église du Christ et les âmes humaines maudites. Usurper l'autorité signifie détourner le pouvoir, s'emparer de l'autorité. Cela signifie organiser un coup d'État sur l'homme et prendre le pouvoir de diriger et de gouverner. C'est mal. L'« enseignement » de la femme condamnée dans ce passage porte le même sens. C'est quelque chose qui est fait contrairement à l'autorité divine. C'est quelque chose fait dans l'entêtement et l'orgueil, sans aucune grâce. C'est un service de charnalité fait dans la contestation et la lutte contre l'homme ; ce que l'homme doit faire qui est pris en charge par la femme capiteuse. L'autorité de l'homme dans l'église est détournée par elle. La direction de l'église est détournée de l'homme et elle devient le commandant en chef. Cela ne doit pas arriver. La femme doit revêtir sa pudeur et être sobre dans l'église. Elle doit reconnaître la direction naturelle de l'homme, la direction divine confiée à l'homme et être entièrement soumise à la direction de l'homme sur l'œuvre de Dieu. Ce passage scripturaire est mieux compris par le passage scripturaire suivant  **\nApocalypse 2 verset 20 à 23   **\n20 Cependant j'ai peu de choses contre toi, parce que tu as permis à cette femme Jézabel, qui se dit prophétesse, d'enseigner et de séduire mes serviteurs à commettre l'impudicité et à manger des viandes sacrifiées aux idoles.\n21 Et je lui ai donné le temps de se repentir de sa fornication ; et elle ne s'est pas repentie.\n22 Voici, je vais la jeter dans un lit, et ceux qui commettent un adultère avec elle dans une grande tribulation, s'ils ne se repentent de leurs actes.\n23 Et je tuerai ses enfants par la mort; et toutes les Églises sauront que je suis celui qui sonde les reins et les cœurs, et je vous rendrai à chacun selon vos œuvres  **\nLes femmes ne doivent pas usurper ou détourner l'autorité de leurs maris dans la famille. Beaucoup de femmes font cela et ruinent leur mariage et leur famille. C'est un mal que la sainte chrétienne ne doit pas faire.  **\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 4 à 6   **\n4 Mais que ce soit l'homme caché du cœur, dans ce qui n'est pas corruptible, même l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille, qui est de grand prix aux yeux de Dieu.\n5 Car c'est ainsi qu'autrefois les saintes femmes, qui se confiaient en Dieu, se paraient elles-mêmes, étant soumises à leurs propres maris ;\n6 De même que Sara obéit à Abraham, l'appelant seigneur ; dont vous êtes les filles, pourvu que vous agissiez bien et que vous ne craigniez aucun étonnement.  **\n4.14 Femmes dirigeantes  **\n Premier Pierre 3 verset 7   **\nDe même, vous les maris, demeurez avec eux selon la connaissance, donnant honneur à la femme, comme au vase le plus faible, et comme étant héritiers ensemble de la grâce de la vie ; que vos prières ne soient pas entravées.  **\nLa femme doit réaliser son armature et chercher protection et couverture en se soumettant à cette consigne. On dit qu'elle est un vaisseau plus faible. Par nature, certaines qualités spéciales sont construites en elle par Dieu dans la création pour un service souhaitable à Dieu et aux hommes. Mais Satan profite de ces qualités pour la tromper, la détruire et l'utiliser pour détruire les autres. Il y a des qualités que les hommes possèdent et des services qu'ils peuvent rendre qui leur sont propres. Une femme peut-elle être leader, pasteur ? Oui, comme nous le voyons dans Deborah, elle était en effet un leader et un \"pasteur\" mais elle cherchait à se couvrir de l'homme. Elle était douce et humble et reconnaissait l'autorité des hommes sur elle.  **\nJuges 4 versets 4 à 6   **\n4 Et Débora, prophétesse, femme de Lapidoth, elle jugea Israël à cette époque-là.\n5 Et elle habita sous le palmier de Débora, entre Rama et Béthel, sur la montagne d'Éphraïm ; et les enfants d'Israël montèrent vers elle pour le jugement.\n6 Et elle envoya chercher Barak, fils d'Abinoam, de Kedeshnaphthali, et lui dit   L'Éternel, le Dieu d'Israël, n'a-t-il pas commandé, en disant   Va, et tire vers le mont Thabor, et prends avec toi dix mille hommes des enfants de Nephthali. et des enfants de Zabulon ?  **\nJuges 5 verset 9   **\nMon cœur est vers les gouverneurs d'Israël, qui se sont offerts volontairement parmi le peuple. Bénissez le SEIGNEUR.  **\nOutre la soumission à son mari pour des conseils et des conseils, le Seigneur a donné un Barak pour se tenir à ses côtés. Elle était suffisamment soumise à l'autorité de l'homme, quoique divinement ointe. De même, Priscille dans le Nouveau Testament était soumise à l'autorité de son mari avec qui elle servait dans le ministère.  **\nLe monde de notre époque semble porter les caractéristiques de l'époque de la prophétesse Deborah. Le diable a fait beaucoup de mal aux hommes. Les hommes ont fui la présence de Dieu. Ils sont rares dans l'église. Ils sont donnés au monde et ont abandonné l'œuvre de Dieu. Le Seigneur donne des ministères aux femmes pour diriger le monde et l'église à travers la repentance finale et le réveil avant l'enlèvement. Que le chemin des femmes ne soit pas bloqué par des traditions et des doctrines contraires aux Écritures. C'est le Seigneur qui a desserré les nœuds des passages scripturaires que beaucoup ont utilisés pour empêcher les travailleuses d'entrer dans les champs de moisson de leur Seigneur et Sauveur bien-aimé pour récolter des fruits pour la vie éternelle. Maintenant, avec ces interprétations scripturaires et la porte ouverte placée devant les saintes femmes, laissez les femmes entrer dans la moisson du Seigneur car la venue du Seigneur est à la porte ! Amen.  **\nApocalypse 3 verset 8   **\nje connais tes oeuvres; voici, j'ai mis devant toi (femme) une porte ouverte, et personne ne peut la fermer, car tu as peu de force, et tu as gardé ma parole, et tu n'as pas renié mon nom.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 5 **\nLES ÉCRITURES SUR LA SAINTE FEMME ET SON MINISTÈRE  **\n5.1 Nouvelle Naissance  **\n1 Corinthiens 5 verset 17,   **\nSi donc quelqu'un est en Christ, il est une nouvelle créature ; les vieilles choses sont passées; voici, toutes choses sont devenues nouvelles.\nLa femme qui désire servir Dieu doit naître de nouveau. Elle doit montrer des preuves claires de repentance et de foi au Seigneur Jésus. Sa famille et les personnes qui l'entourent doivent témoigner de sa nouvelle vie et de la justice de Christ en elle.  **\n5.2 Sanctification et pureté du cœur  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 25 à 27,   **\n25 Maris, aimez vos femmes, comme Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle;\n26 afin qu'il la sanctifie et la purifie par le lavage d'eau par la parole,\n27 afin qu'il se la présente comme une église glorieuse, sans tache, ni ride, ni rien de semblable; mais qu'il soit saint et sans défaut.  **\nLa sanctification est une expérience séparée de la grâce requise chez celui qui est déjà né de nouveau. Une femme qui est déjà née de nouveau a besoin de la sanctification du cœur ou de la purification du cœur comme seconde touche divine.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 4 verset 3   **\n3 Car c'est la volonté de Dieu, même votre sanctification, que vous vous absteniez de fornication;  **\nPar cette expérience, son cœur reçoit une seconde purification par le sang de Christ et l'opération du Saint-Esprit à travers la parole de Dieu, par laquelle elle est rendue sainte et pure de cœur pour servir Dieu et avoir des relations avec des hommes et des femmes dans l'église et dans le monde irréprochable.  **\n 1 Thessaloniciens 3 versets 12, 13 ;   **\n12 Et que le Seigneur vous fasse croître et abonder en amour les uns envers les autres et envers tous les hommes, comme nous le faisons envers vous ;\n13 Pour qu'il finisse par affermir vos coeurs dans une sainteté irréprochable devant Dieu, notre Père, lors de l'avènement de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ avec tous ses saints.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 5 verset 23   **\n23 Et le Dieu même de paix vous sanctifie entièrement ; et je prie Dieu que tout ton esprit, ton âme et ton corps soient préservés sans reproche jusqu'à la venue de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.\nPriez sincèrement et avec persévérance pour votre sanctification que Dieu donne à tous les croyants qui désirent Le servir avec engagement quotidiennement dans la justice et la sainteté tous les jours de leur vie.  **\n5.3 Baptême du Saint-Esprit  **\nJoël 2 verset 28, 29   **\n28 Et il arrivera après que je répandrai mon esprit sur toute chair ; et vos fils et vos filles prophétiseront, vos vieillards auront des songes, vos jeunes gens des visions.\n29 Et aussi sur les serviteurs et sur les servantes, en ces jours-là, je répandrai mon esprit.  **\nActes 1 verset 8   **\n8 Mais vous recevrez une puissance, après que le Saint-Esprit sera venu sur vous, et vous serez mes témoins à Jérusalem, et dans toute la Judée, et à Samarie, et jusqu'à l'extrémité de la terre.  **\nActes 2 verset 14   **\n14 Ceux-ci continuèrent tous d'un commun accord dans la prière et la supplication, avec les femmes, et Marie, la mère de Jésus, et avec ses frères  **\nLe baptême du Saint-Esprit est la promesse de Dieu pour ses fils et ses filles. Le but principal du baptême du Saint-Esprit, comme le montrent clairement les Écritures, est le service chrétien. La puissance reçue par ce baptême agit efficacement chez le croyant et le ministre chrétien pour être plus efficace, fructueux et infatigable dans les affaires du Seigneur. Comprenez que ceux qui sont en Christ peuvent être dans le ministère pour Dieu, mais ils deviennent plus efficaces, victorieux, conquérants et fructueux après le baptême du Saint-Esprit. Ce baptême est attesté par le parler en langue sous l'inspiration du Saint-Esprit. La promesse du baptême de l'Esprit a été faite pour les filles aussi bien que pour les fils de Dieu. Les femmes dans la chambre haute étaient également remplies du Saint-Esprit. C'est la preuve scripturaire qu'une femme peut entrer dans n'importe quel ministère que Dieu l'a appelée. Priez sincèrement pour le baptême du Saint-Esprit pour un ministère efficace dans le corps de Christ.  **\nLuc 11 verset 13   **\n13 Si donc vous, étant mauvais, vous savez donner de bons cadeaux à vos enfants ; combien plus votre Père céleste donnera-t-il le Saint-Esprit à ceux qui le lui demandent ?  **\nDemandez aussi les dons du Saint-Esprit pour un riche ministère.  **\nHébreux 2 verset 4   **\n4 Dieu leur rendait-il aussi témoignage par des signes et des prodiges, et par divers miracles et dons du Saint-Esprit, selon sa propre volonté ?  **\n5.4 Restitution Chrétienne  **\nEzéchiel 33 verset 14 à 16   **\n14 De plus, quand je dis aux méchants   Tu mourras sûrement ; s'il se détourne de son péché et fait ce qui est licite et juste;\n15 Si le méchant rend le gage, rend ce qu'il a volé, marche dans les statuts de vie, sans commettre d'iniquité ; il vivra sûrement, il ne mourra pas.\n16 Aucun de ses péchés qu'il a commis ne lui sera mentionné   il a fait ce qui est licite et droit ; il vivra sûrement.  **\nMatthieu. 5 verset 23 à 24   **\n23 Si donc tu apportes ton offrande à l'autel, et que là tu te souviennes que ton frère a quelque chose contre toi;\n24 Laisse là ton offrande devant l'autel, et va; réconcilie-toi d'abord avec ton frère, puis viens offrir ton offrande.  **\nLa restitution est le mot utilisé pour désigner le règlement des actes répréhensibles passés requis de celui qui a cru en Christ. Cela implique de s'excuser auprès des propriétaires d'objets que l'on a volés ou détournés frauduleusement et de restituer ces objets à moins que le propriétaire ne choisisse de pardonner au contrevenant et déclare ne pas en avoir besoin. La restitution implique également de découvrir les mensonges racontés et de s'en excuser, d'avouer et de cesser les résultats et les réclamations de faux documents. Il est demandé aussi à un vrai croyant de régler des relations aigres pour vivre dans la paix et la sainteté devant Dieu et devant les hommes. Hébreux 12 verset 14, Recherchez la paix avec tous et la sainteté, sans laquelle personne ne verra le Seigneur.\nDes prières et des conseils suffisants de vrais et saints hommes et femmes de Dieu sont nécessaires avant d'effectuer une restitution délicate, en particulier celles impliquant d'autres qui sont encore incroyants.    **\nProverbes 11 verset 14   **\nLà où il n'y a pas de conseil, le peuple tombe ; mais dans la multitude des conseillers il y a la sécurité.  **\n Jacques 1 verset 5   **\nSi quelqu'un d'entre vous manque de sagesse, qu'il la demande à Dieu, qui donne à tous libéralement et sans reproche; et il lui sera donné.  **\n5.5 Habillage et parure divins  **\nRomains 12 verset 2   **\n2 Et ne vous conformez pas à ce monde, mais soyez transformés par le renouvellement de votre esprit, afin que vous puissiez prouver quelle est cette bonne, et acceptable, et parfaite, volonté de Dieu.  **\nPremier Timothée 2 verset 4 ; dix   **\n4 qui veut que tous les hommes soient sauvés et parviennent à la connaissance de la vérité. 10 Mais (ce qui convient aux femmes professant la piété) avec de bonnes œuvres.  **\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 1 à 4   **\nDe même, femmes, soyez soumises à vos propres maris ; que, si quelqu'un n'obéit pas à la parole, il peut aussi, sans la parole, être gagné par la conversation des épouses ; 2 Pendant qu'ils contemplent ta conversation chaste accompagnée de peur.\n3 Dont la parure ne soit pas cette parure extérieure de tresser les cheveux, et de porter de l'or, ou de se vêtir ;\n4 Mais que ce soit l'homme caché du cœur, dans ce qui n'est pas corruptible, même l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille, qui est de grand prix aux yeux de Dieu.  **\n2 Corinthiens 7 verset 1   **\nAyant donc ces promesses, bien-aimés, purifions-nous de toute souillure de la chair et de l'esprit, perfectionnant la sainteté dans la crainte de Dieu.  **\nDieu exige la sainteté à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur des femmes et des hommes chrétiens ministres. La permanente, le Jerry curling, l'attachement des cheveux, le cortex, les rouges à lèvres, les bijoux, la peinture du corps, les ongles longs, l'artifice dans la parure, le tissage et d'autres dans leur classe sont des propriétés sales qui souillent un croyant devant Dieu. La sainteté exige que tout cela soit retiré de l'habillement corporel, y compris les parfums et l'alliance. Les pantalons également appelés pantalons, les jupes courtes, les jupes moulantes, les chemisiers et les robes, les robes transparentes, les décolletés exposant les parties sensibles du corps des femmes sont considérés comme les robes des prostituées.  **\nProverbe 7 verset 10 Et voici, il se rencontra une femme vêtue d'un vêtement de prostituée et subtile de cœur.  **\nLe tressage ou le tressage des cheveux ne fait pas référence à la façon naturelle dont certaines femmes gardent leurs cheveux, mais plutôt à la coiffure impie, à la mode et mondaine pratiquée par des femmes dont la motivation est la beauté et la publicité d'elles-mêmes devant les hommes. Ce sont des enfants du diable qui suivent ses mauvais desseins et ses modes. Ils sont connus par leurs fruits.  **\nMatthieu 12 verset 33   **\nOu faites que l'arbre soit bon et que son fruit soit bon; ou bien rendre l'arbre corrompu et son fruit corrompu; car l'arbre se reconnaît à son fruit.  **\nLes robes d'une sainte femme ministre doivent descendre bien en dessous de ses genoux avec suffisamment d'espace pour qu'elles ne reculent pas dans sa position assise. S'asseoir et voir vos genoux, c'est manifester l'impiété aux yeux de Dieu. Tout aussi répugnant, c'est quand dans votre pansement vos aisselles ou votre poitrine sont nues. L'habillement de la sainte femme doit être adapté à son message devant son auditoire.  **\n5.6 Chasteté de la sœur non mariée  **\nRuth 3 verset 10   **\n10 Et il dit   Tu es bénie de l'Éternel, ma fille ! car tu as montré plus de bonté à la fin qu'au début, puisque tu n'as pas suivi les jeunes gens, qu'ils soient pauvres ou riches.  **\nPremier Timothée 5 verset 2   **\n2 Les femmes âgées comme mères; les cadettes comme des sœurs, en toute pureté.  **\nLa femme célibataire ou la veuve au service du Seigneur doit rester pure et sans tache. Elle ne doit pas corrompre sa langue ou être corrompue par des hommes à cause de l'argent ou d' une vie négligente. Elle ne doit pas pratiquer la masturbation ou le lesbianisme. La pureté doit être vue dans ses relations et ses interactions.   **\nPremier Timothée 5 verset 2   **\nLes femmes âgées comme mères; les cadettes comme des sœurs, en toute pureté.  **\nSes procédures conjugales doivent être scripturairement justes et pures. La personne qu'elle accepte d'épouser doit être un véritable enfant de Dieu, possédant des preuves de salut et bien parlé par les croyants. La parade nuptiale, le paiement de la dot et la consommation conjugale doivent être bien surveillés par l'église et doivent se faire avec la crainte de Dieu.  **\nHébreu 13 verset 4   **\nMariage honorable en tous et lit sans souillure, mais Dieu jugera les impudiques et les adultères.  **\n5.7 Union conjugale appropriée  **\nJean 4 verset 16 à 18   **\n16 Jésus lui dit   Va, appelle ton mari, et viens ici.\n17 La femme répondit et dit   Je n'ai pas de mari. Jésus lui dit   Tu as bien dit, je n'ai pas de mari  \n18 Car tu as eu cinq maris; et celui que tu as maintenant n'est pas ton mari   en cela tu as dit vrai.  **\nRomains 7 verset 2,3   **\n2 Car la femme qui a un mari est liée par la loi à son mari tant qu'il vit; mais si le mari est mort, elle est déliée de la loi de son mari.\n3 Ainsi donc, si, du vivant de son mari, elle est mariée à un autre homme, elle sera appelée adultère ; mais si son mari est mort, elle est libre de cette loi ; de sorte qu'elle n'est pas adultère, bien qu'elle soit mariée à un autre homme.  **\n1 Corinthiens 7 verset 10,11   **\n10 Et aux mariés, je n'ordonne pas à moi, mais au Seigneur, que la femme ne se sépare pas de son mari  \n11 Mais si elle s'en va, qu'elle reste célibataire ou qu'elle se réconcilie avec son mari , et que le mari ne répudie pas sa femme.  **\nLa femme chrétienne doit être dans une relation conjugale appropriée et biblique. La femme de Samarie aurait besoin de corriger sa vie conjugale afin de continuer avec le Seigneur et de Le servir. Cela nécessiterait un guide scripturaire et des conseils de ministres mûrs pour identifier son mari légitime parmi les six hommes qu'elle avait épousés. Continuer dans une mauvaise relation conjugale, c'est renoncer à la vie chrétienne et au ministère. Le mariage illégal maintient quelqu'un dans le péché et la mort. Si le mari n'est pas converti, elle doit rester avec lui dans le mariage, tout en faisant son service à Dieu, combien plus quand le mari est aussi en Christ. Cependant, s'il y a une crise qu'elle et les anciens de l'église ne peuvent pas gérer et qui justifie la séparation, elle doit rester célibataire ou se réconcilier avec son mari lorsque la situation est sous contrôle.  **\n5.8 Tête et couvre-chef  **\n 1 Corinthiens 11 verset 3 à 7, 15  **\n3 Mais je voudrais que vous sachiez que le chef de tout homme, c'est Christ ; et le chef de la femme est l'homme; et le chef de Christ est Dieu.\n4 Tout homme qui prie ou prophétise, la tête couverte, déshonore sa tête.\n5 Mais toute femme qui prie ou prophétise la tête découverte déshonore sa tête ; car c'est même tout un comme si elle était rasée.\n6 Car si la femme n'est pas couverte, qu'elle soit aussi tondue ; mais si c'est une honte pour une femme d'être tondue ou rasée, qu'elle soit couverte.\n7 En effet, l'homme ne doit pas se couvrir la tête, car il est l'image et la gloire de Dieu, mais la femme est la gloire de l'homme.\n15 Mais si une femme a de longs cheveux, c'est une gloire pour elle, car ses cheveux lui sont donnés pour couverture  **\nComme Christ est le chef de l'homme, de même l'homme est le chef de la femme. La femme est commandée de se couvrir la tête d'un voile lorsqu'elle prie ou prophétise pour montrer que pendant le culte spirituel de Dieu, l'autorité de l'homme ne doit pas être affichée, mais celle du Christ. En dehors de cette activité spirituelle formelle, la femme n'est pas contrainte de se couvrir la tête d'un morceau de tissu ou d'un couvre-chef. C'est parce que Dieu lui a donné de longs cheveux qui couvrent sa tête. Les cheveux longs sur la tête de la femme sont pour sa gloire. Les femmes chrétiennes ne doivent pas adorer dans l'église ou participer à une activité de culte spirituel formel n'importe où avec la tête nue. Prier ou prêcher la tête nue est une désobéissance à la parole de Dieu.   **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 10   **\nC'est pourquoi la femme doit avoir pouvoir sur sa tête à cause des anges.  **\n5.9 Soumission au Mari  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 22 à 24   **\n22 Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme au Seigneur. 23 Car le mari est le chef de la femme, comme Christ est le chef de l'Église, et il est le Sauveur du corps.\n24 C'est pourquoi, comme l'Église est soumise à Christ, ainsi les femmes le sont en toutes choses à leurs maris.  **\nColossiens 4 verset 18   **\nFemmes, soyez soumises à vos propres maris, comme il convient dans le Seigneur.  **\n Premier Pierre 3 verset 1, 2   **\nDe même, femmes, soyez soumises à vos propres maris ; que, si quelqu'un n'obéit pas à la parole, il peut aussi, sans la parole, être gagné par la conversation des épouses ;\n2 Pendant qu'ils contemplent ta conversation chaste accompagnée de peur.  **\nLes femmes sont commandées dans les Écritures d'obéir et de se soumettre à leurs propres maris en tout, comme l'église obéit et se soumet à Christ. La direction du mari, même l'incrédule, sur la femme, est comparée à la direction de Christ sur l'église. La soumission de la femme à son mari doit être au même degré que la soumission de l'église à Christ. Les femmes chrétiennes doivent obéir et se soumettre à leurs maris incroyants au point que certaines d'entre elles peuvent se convertir en observant la vie pieuse et sans tache de leurs femmes. Cependant, la soumission de la femme à son mari doit être « comme il convient dans le Seigneur ». La soumission au mari n'implique pas de satisfaire ses passions pécheresses ou d'obéir à ses demandes et commandements impies. Le mari n'est pas le propriétaire de son âme mais Dieu et elle n'est nulle part chargée de mettre en péril sa vie éternelle afin de maintenir l'union conjugale terrestre. Comme les trois enfants Hébreux ont répondu au roi Nebucadnetsar, une femme chrétienne doit répondre humblement mais fermement à son mari quand il devient mauvais en exigeant et en exerçant son autorité sur elle. La relation conjugale et ses privilèges terrestres doivent être méprisés lorsque le mari exige la soumission de la femme à ses idoles et à Satan. Dieu, est capable de la garder dans le mariage s'il le souhaite. Elle ne doit pas perdre son âme en enfer à cause de la férocité de son mari. Si Dieu choisit de ne pas la préserver dans le mariage, elle devrait être prête à mettre fin au mariage pour l'amour de son Seigneur Jésus et de son âme éternelle, sans se soucier de quoi qu'elle puisse souffrir.   **\nDaniel 3 verset 16 à 18   **\n16 Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego répondirent et dirent au roi   Ô Nebucadnetsar, nous ne prenons pas soin de te répondre sur cette affaire.\n17 S'il en est ainsi, notre Dieu que nous servons peut nous délivrer de la fournaise ardente, et il nous délivrera de ta main, ô roi.\n18 Mais sinon, sache, ô roi, que nous ne servirons pas tes dieux, et que nous n'adorerons pas la statue d'or que tu as dressée.  **\nActes 4 verset 19,20   **\n19 Mais Pierre et Jean répondirent et leur dirent   S'il est juste aux yeux de Dieu de vous écouter plus que Dieu, jugez-vous.\n20 Car nous ne pouvons que dire les choses que nous avons vues et entendues.  **\nActes 5 verset 29,   **\nAlors Pierre et les autres apôtres répondirent et dirent   Nous devons obéir à Dieu plutôt qu'aux hommes.  **\nLes apôtres ont ainsi résisté aux dirigeants impies des Juifs qui avaient l'intention de ruiner la foi chrétienne.  **\n5.10 Relation conjugale  **\n1 Corinthiens 7 verset 1 à 5   **\n1 Or concernant les choses dont vous m'avez écrit , il est bon qu'un homme ne touche pas une femme. 2 Néanmoins, pour éviter l'impudicité, que chacun ait sa femme, et que chaque femme ait son mari.\n3 Que le mari rende à la femme la bienveillance qui lui est due, et de même aussi la femme au mari.\n4 La femme n'a pas le pouvoir de son propre corps, mais le mari ; et de même aussi le mari n'a pas le pouvoir de son propre corps, mais la femme.\n5 Ne vous trompez pas les uns les autres, si ce n'est avec un consentement pour un temps, afin que vous puissiez vous adonner au jeûne et à la prière ; et rassemblez-vous de nouveau, afin que Satan ne vous tente pas pour votre incontinence.  **\nProverbes 24 verset 3   **\nC'est par la sagesse qu'une maison est bâtie; et en comprenant c'est établi  **\nProverbes 14 verset 1   **\nToute femme sage bâtit sa maison; mais l'insensée l'abat avec ses mains.  **\nLa relation sexuelle entre la femme chrétienne et son mari doit être traitée avec l'obéissance et la sagesse scripturaires. La femme doit chercher à satisfaire son mari afin qu'elle n'ouvre pas la porte au diable pour frustrer sa vie chrétienne et son ministère. Elle doit savoir que le jeûne n'exige pas la cessation des relations sexuelles conjugales, sauf qu'il doit être engagé pendant plusieurs jours. Dans le cas où l'on désire s'engager dans un long jeûne, une discussion et un accord mutuels sont nécessaires. Une méthode de planification familiale appropriée doit être adoptée pour permettre la poursuite de la relation sexuelle. Des mots doux et gentils sont nécessaires pour empêcher le mari d'avoir des relations sexuelles en période de fatigue, d'indisposition, de maladie ou de véritables difficultés. La vie sexuelle du mariage doit être suffisamment couverte par la prière pour en éloigner le diable. La bénédiction du Seigneur devrait être recherchée sur lui afin qu'il puisse bénir le mariage avec des plaisirs. La patience et les prières sont requises pour certains maris de cette région.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 6  **\nLES ÉCRITURES SUR LA FEMME CHRÉTIENNE ET SON MINISTÈRE  **\n6.1 Sagesse et prudence pour les femmes ministres  **\n1 Corinthiens 7 versets 32 à 34   **\n32 Mais je t'aurais sans prudence. Celui qui n'est pas marié se soucie des choses qui appartiennent au Seigneur, comment il peut plaire au Seigneur  \n33 Mais celui qui est marié se soucie des choses du monde, des moyens de plaire à sa femme.\n34 Il y a aussi une différence entre une femme et une vierge.  **\nLa femme célibataire se soucie des choses du Seigneur, afin d'être sainte de corps et d'esprit, mais celle qui est mariée se soucie des choses du monde, des moyens de plaire à son mari.  ** \nTite 2 verset 3 à 5   **\n3 Les femmes âgées de même, afin qu'elles se conduisent comme il convient à la sainteté, non de faux accusateurs, peu portées à beaucoup de vin, enseignantes de bonnes choses ;\n4 Afin qu'elles apprennent aux jeunes filles à être sobres, à aimer leur mari, à aimer leurs enfants,\n5 Etre prudentes, chastes, gardiennes de la maison, bonnes, obéissantes à leurs propres maris, afin que la parole de Dieu ne soit pas blasphémée.  **\nLa sœur chrétienne célibataire a de nombreuses occasions de servir le Seigneur à tous les niveaux. Elle ne souffre pas de restriction due à un mari ou à des enfants. Elle a tout le temps de prier, d'étudier, de chanter, d'assister à des programmes lointains et proches, d'aller à la veillée, de faire des jeûnes marathon, d'aller aux croisades et à l'évangélisation. Celle qui est mariée doit savoir qu'on ne s'attend pas à ce qu'elle aille aussi loin que la sœur célibataire. Agir ainsi, c'est négliger son mari et la maisonnée et faire du nom du Seigneur un reproche. L'épouse chrétienne doit satisfaire à toutes ses obligations envers son mari, ses enfants et sa maison. Elle doit tout faire pour que même si le mari est impie, il n'ait pas de juste cause pour l'empêcher de faire le service de Dieu. Les femmes chrétiennes doivent savoir que la société humaine considère les femmes comme des vases plus faibles et ne s'attend pas à ce qu'elles jouent le rôle de \"sauvages et rudes\" dans le ministère. Les risques que les hommes chrétiens peuvent prendre dans le ministère dans la société doivent être évités par les femmes. Cela peut être autorisé pour les hommes, mais pas pour les femmes. Que la femme chrétienne se soumette à Dieu et à ceux sous lesquels le Seigneur l'a placée afin qu'elle puisse être dirigée et guidée vers un ministère accompli.   **\nPsaume 32 verset 8, je t'instruirai et t'enseignerai dans le chemin où tu iras, je te guiderai avec mon œil.  **\nEsaïe 48 verset 17 à 19   **\n17 Ainsi parle l'Éternel, ton Rédempteur, le Saint d'Israël; Je suis l'Éternel, ton Dieu, qui t'enseigne à profiter, qui te guide par le chemin que tu dois suivre.\n18 O que tu as écouté mes commandements ! alors ta paix avait été comme un fleuve, et ta justice comme les vagues de la mer;\n19 Ta semence aussi était comme le sable, et le rejeton de tes entrailles comme son gravier; son nom n'aurait pas dû être retranché ni détruit devant Moi.  **\n6.2 Allez dans le monde entier et prêchez  **\nMarc 16 verset 15 à 20   **\n15 Et il leur dit   Allez par tout le monde, et prêchez l'Evangile à toute créature.\n16 Celui qui croira et sera baptisé sera sauvé; mais celui qui ne croira pas sera damné.\n17 Et voici les miracles qui accompagneront ceux qui auront cru ; En mon nom, ils chasseront les démons ; ils parleront de nouvelles langues;\n18 Ils prendront des serpents; et s'ils boivent quelque chose de mortel, cela ne leur fera pas de mal; ils imposeront les mains aux malades, et ils seront guéris.\n19 Ainsi donc, après que le Seigneur leur eut parlé, il fut élevé au ciel et s'assit à la droite de Dieu.\n20 Et ils sortirent et prêchèrent partout, le Seigneur agissant avec eux et confirmant la parole par des miracles. Amen.  **\nLa femme est une disciple du Seigneur Jésus et partage les responsabilités de la commission ou de l'ordre donné dans l'Écriture. Selon l'écriture ci-dessus, elle devrait faire ce qui suit     **\ni.\tAllez dans le monde entier et prêchez l'évangile à toute créature.\nii.\tBaptisez ceux qui croient au Seigneur Jésus parmi eux.\niii.\tAyez des signes suite à son ministère   parler en langues, chasser les démons, prendre du poison sans se blesser, s'adonner aux serpents sans se blesser, imposer les mains aux malades et ils seront guéris.\niv.\tLe Seigneur Jésus-Christ travaille avec des femmes disciples qui obéissent à ce commandement pour confirmer leurs paroles par des signes qui suivent.  **\nSi Dieu conduit une femme à l'élever dans une communauté où il n'y a pas d'évangile, elle devrait se lever pour obéir à la commission du Seigneur sur elle. Cependant, une femme qui est dans une église établie où les hommes fonctionnent doit se soumettre sous l'autorité et fonctionner comme elle est assignée sans contestation. Le don d'une femme lui ouvrira certainement la voie et l'amènera devant de grands hommes  **\n6.3 Apprenez-leur à tout observer  **\nMatthieu 28 verset 18 à 20   **\n18 Et Jésus, s'approchant, leur parla, disant   Tout pouvoir m'a été donné dans le ciel et sur la terre.\n19 Allez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit  \n20 Enseignez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai prescrit ; et voici, je suis toujours avec vous, même jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amen.  **\nLa femme chrétienne est disciple du Christ tout comme le chrétien. Cette commission lui est également adressée et est la suivante  \ni.\tAllez donc et enseignez toutes les nations.\nii.\tBaptisez-les au nom du Père, et du Fils et du Saint-Esprit.\niii.\tApprenez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai prescrit.\niv.\tJe suis toujours avec vous, même jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amen.  **\nCette écriture autorise la femme chrétienne à prêcher l'évangile afin de susciter des disciples pour le Christ où qu'elle se trouve. Elle est toujours autorisée à enseigner aux convertis et aux disciples ignorants toute la parole de Dieu. Le Seigneur a promis d'être avec elle si elle s'engage fidèlement dans cette mission. Mais la femme chrétienne ministre devrait apprendre à travailler parmi les hommes en toute soumission, sainteté et compréhension. L'autorité de l'homme ne doit être usurpée à aucun moment.  **\n6.4 Étudier, méditer et obéir à la Parole de Dieu   **\nMatthieu 4 verset 4 Mais il répondit et dit   Il est écrit   L'homme ne vivra pas de pain seulement, mais de toute parole qui sort de la bouche de Dieu.  **\nPsaume 119 verset 9 à 11   **\n9 Avec quoi un jeune homme purifiera-t-il sa voie ? en y prenant garde selon ta parole.\n10 De tout mon coeur je t'ai cherché; O ne me laisse pas m'éloigner de Tes commandements.\n11 J'ai caché ta parole dans mon coeur, afin de ne pas pécher contre toi.  **\n2 Timothée 2 verset 15   **\n15 Étudie à te montrer approuvé à Dieu, un ouvrier qui n'a pas à rougir, divisant avec droiture la parole de vérité.  **\nPour maintenir la vie chrétienne et réussir dans le ministère, le ministre chrétien doit se nourrir quotidiennement de la parole de Dieu comme il se nourrit de nourriture pour maintenir son corps physique. Le ministre ne doit jamais cesser de lire les Écritures et les écrits inspirés par des écrivains chrétiens oints. Elle prend une nourriture spirituelle suffisante qui soutiendra sa vie chrétienne et l'enrichira du message chrétien. Elle ne devrait pas être liée à la dénomination, mais être ouverte à Dieu pour utiliser son serviteur oint partout où il choisit de bénir sa vie.  **\nPremier Timothée 4 versets 13 à 15,   **\n13 Jusqu'à ce que je vienne, sois attentif à la lecture, à l'exhortation, à l'enseignement.\n14 Ne néglige pas le don qui est en toi, qui t'a été donné par prophétie, avec l'imposition des mains du presbytère.\n15 Méditez sur ces choses ; donne-toi entièrement à eux; que ton profit puisse apparaître à tous.  **\n6.5 Vie de prière sonore  **\nJérémie 29 verset 10 à 12   **\n10 Car ainsi dit l'Éternel   Après soixante-dix ans accomplis à Babylone, je vous visiterai, et j'accomplirai ma bonne parole envers vous, en vous faisant retourner en ce lieu.\n11 Car je connais les pensées que j'ai à votre égard, dit l'Éternel, des pensées de paix et non de mal, pour vous donner une fin attendue.\n12 Alors vous m'invoquerez, et vous irez me prier, et je vous exaucerai.  **\nMatthieu 7 verset 7 à 8,   **\n7 Demandez, et l'on vous donnera; cherchez et vous trouverez; frappez, et on vous ouvrira  **\nMatthieu 7 verset 8   **\nCar quiconque demande reçoit; et celui qui cherche trouve; et à celui qui frappe on lui ouvrira  **\nEphésiens 6 verset 8   **\nSachant que tout bien qu'un homme fait, il le recevra du Seigneur, qu'il soit esclave ou libre  **\nLa femme ministre doit s'adonner à la prière. Bien qu'elle puisse être entourée de demandes conjugales et domestiques, elle doit créer du temps pour son Dieu. La prière est nécessaire pour la maintenir dans une sainteté continuelle devant Dieu. C'est un moyen vital pour sa force spirituelle et son mentorat dans la vie et le ministère chrétien. En plus de créer du temps pour cela, elle a besoin d'un partenaire de prière pour l'aider dans son travail de prière. Les veillées nocturnes, la prière et le jeûne et d'autres méthodes de prière doivent être conçues et bien suivies par elle. Le Dieu qui répond aux prières sera toujours là pour prouver sa fidélité et pour son succès et son encouragement.  **\n 6.6 Bonne vie à jeun  **\nMatthieu 17 verset 21   **\nCependant, ce genre ne sort que par la prière et le jeûne   **\nApprenez à jeûner. Jeûnez souvent, mais n'abusez pas de votre vie de foi par un jeûne monotone et sans inspiration. Le jeûne renforce votre foi et votre prière et vous donne la victoire sur certaines prises fortes de l'ennemi. Soyez sensible aux conseils de Dieu concernant le jeûne.  **\n6.7 Prêchez et enseignez la saine doctrine  **\nTite 1 verset 1 à 2   **\n1 Paul, serviteur de Dieu et apôtre de Jésus-Christ, selon la foi des élus de Dieu et la reconnaissance de la vérité qui est selon la piété ;\n2 Dans l'espérance de la vie éternelle, que Dieu, qui ne peut mentir, a promise avant que le monde ait commencé ;  **\n2 Timothée 2 verset 2   **\n2 Et les choses que tu as entendues de moi parmi de nombreux témoins, les mêmes confient à des hommes fidèles, qui pourront aussi enseigner les autres.  **\nPrêchez la vérité comme vous l'avez appris dans des ministres justes et saints. C'est la vérité qui produit la repentance du péché et une vie sainte parmi les croyants. La vérité libère l'auditeur du péché, de Satan et du monde. Prêchez la vérité et l'amour de Dieu, la vérité et la sagesse, la vérité et le service. Mettez l'accent sur la vérité, la droiture et la sainteté auprès de votre auditoire. Les bénédictions humaines se trouvent dans l'obéissance aux vérités scripturaires de Dieu. Souvenez-vous que c'est en pratiquant et en prêchant ces doctrines de la vérité que vous et les personnes que vous accompagnez pouvez hériter de la vie éternelle.  **\nPremier Timothée 4 verset 16   **\nPrends garde à toi-même et à la doctrine ; continuez en eux, car en faisant cela, vous vous sauverez vous-même et ceux qui vous écoutent.  **\n6.8 Ayez foi en Dieu pour votre ministère  **\nMarc 11 verset 22   **\nEt Jesering leur dit   Ayez foi en Dieu  **\nGenèse 15 verset 1   **\nAprès ces choses, la parole de l'Éternel vint à Abram dans une vision, disant   Ne crains pas, Abram, je suis ton bouclier et ta très grande récompense.  **\nRomains 1 verset 17   **\nCar la justice de Dieu y est révélée de foi en foi, selon qu'il est écrit   Le juste vivra par la foi.  **\nApprenez à vivre par la foi en Dieu. Ayez absolument confiance en Dieu en Dieu. Dépendez de lui pour votre provision, votre protection, votre puissance pour le service et votre progrès. Croyez aux promesses que Dieu vous a faites. Par la foi en Dieu, vous pouvez affronter des oppositions sur votre chemin. Par la foi, vous finirez bien et mourrez dans la justice et la sainteté ou participerez à l'enlèvement du saint.   **\nHébreu 11 verset 1 à 3,6   **\n1 Or la foi est l'assurance des choses qu'on espère, la preuve de celles qu'on ne voit pas.\n2 Car par elle les anciens ont obtenu un bon rapport.\n3 Par la foi, nous comprenons que les mondes ont été formés par la parole de Dieu, de sorte que les choses qui se voient n'ont pas été faites de choses qui apparaissent.\n6 Mais sans la foi, il est impossible de lui plaire, car celui qui vient à Dieu doit croire qu'il existe, et qu'il est le rémunérateur de ceux qui le cherchent avec diligence.  **\n6.9 Soutien dans le ministère  **\nActe 20 verset 33 à 35   **\nJe n'ai convoité l'argent, l'or ou les vêtements de personne.\n34 Oui, vous savez vous-mêmes que ces mains ont pourvu à mes besoins et à ceux qui étaient avec moi.\n35 Je vous ai tout dit, comment vous devez travailler avec tant d'efforts pour soutenir les faibles, et vous souvenir des paroles du Seigneur Jésus, comment il a dit   Il y a plus de bonheur à donner qu'à recevoir  **\n1 Corinthiens 9 verset 14 à 15   **\n14 De même, le Seigneur a ordonné que ceux qui prêchent l'évangile vivent de l'évangile.\n15 Mais je n'ai usé d'aucune de ces choses, et je n'ai pas non plus écrit ces choses, pour qu'il me soit fait ainsi, car il valait mieux pour moi de mourir, que qu'aucun homme rende ma glorieuse vaine  **\n\nCertains ministères sont suffisamment petits pour être dirigés par des femmes ministres sans grand besoin de soutien humain, matériel et financier. Mais certains en ont besoin en raison de la taille du ministère. Dieu fournira le soutien. Celui qui a donné le ministère fournira tout ce qui est nécessaire pour le faire fonctionner avec succès et droiture. Il suscitera un soutien financier et matériel de la bonne source. Cependant, nous apprenons de l'apôtre Paul que le ministre doit être personnellement impliqué dans la fourniture et le soutien de son ministère là où elle le peut. Paul était dans le travail rémunéré, s'engageant dans son métier ici et là pour subvenir à ses besoins et à ceux de ceux qui travaillaient avec lui. Il a dit qu'il avait fait cela pour que les gens ne blasphèment pas son service évangélique à cause de ses exigences financières. Les femmes ministres ne devraient jamais prêcher pour de l'argent ni amadouer le peuple de Dieu pour qu'il donne involontairement et impie. Les fausses prophéties, les promesses et les miracles doivent être détestés et résistés jusqu'au bout, sinon sa vie ne devrait jamais être pressée de développer le ministère. Elle doit travailler en paix, en rendant grâce pour le peu qu'elle accomplit pour le Seigneur. Elle doit éviter toute association avec des ouvriers impies et trompeurs. Elle doit veiller et prier sur ceux qui veulent rejoindre ou soutenir le ministère pour s'assurer que Dieu les envoie.  **\n6.10 Attendez-vous à vos récompenses de Dieu  **\nApocalypse 22 verset 12   **\n12 Et voici, je viens bientôt; et ma récompense est avec moi, pour rendre à chacun selon ce que sera son oeuvre.  **\n1 Corinthiens 15 verset 58   **\n58 C'est pourquoi, mes frères bien-aimés, soyez fermes, inébranlables, abondant toujours dans l'œuvre du Seigneur, car vous savez que votre travail n'est pas vain dans le Seigneur.\nDeuxième Timothée 4 verset 6 à 8  **\n6 Car je suis maintenant prêt à être offert, et le temps de mon départ est proche.\n7 J'ai combattu le bon combat, j'ai achevé ma course, j'ai gardé la foi  \n8 Désormais m'est réservée une couronne de justice, que l'Éternel, le juste juge, me donnera en ce jour-là; et pas seulement à moi, mais aussi à tous ceux qui aiment son apparition.  **\nTous ceux qui travaillent pour le Seigneur dans un ministère vrai et juste, homme et femme, seront récompensés selon leurs œuvres. Travaillez pour les récompenses qui viennent de Dieu. Assurez-vous de vous maintenir dans la vérité, la justice et la sainteté afin que vous puissiez entrer au ciel et profiter des grandes récompenses qui vous attendent. Sachez que Dieu récompense également ses fidèles serviteurs sur terre. La sainteté et la droiture sont la clé d'un ministère féminin acceptable et fructueux.  **\nEsaïe 6 verset 1 à 8   **\n1 L'année de la mort du roi Ozias, je vis aussi l'Éternel assis sur un trône haut et élevé, et sa traîne remplissait le temple.\n2 Au-dessus se tenaient les séraphins ; chacun avait six ailes; de deux il se couvrit le visage, et de deux il se couvrit les pieds, et de deux il vola.\n3 Et l'un criait à l'autre, et disait   Saint, saint, saint est l'Éternel des armées   toute la terre est pleine de sa gloire.\n4 Et les poteaux de la porte s'ébranlèrent à la voix de celui qui criait, et la maison se remplit de fumée.\n5 Alors j'ai dit   Malheur à moi ! car je suis perdu; car je suis un homme aux lèvres impures, et j'habite au milieu d'un peuple aux lèvres impures, car mes yeux ont vu le roi, l'Éternel des armées.\n6 Alors l'un des séraphins s'envola vers moi, ayant à la main un charbon ardent qu'il avait pris avec les pincettes de dessus l'autel ;\n7 Et il le mit sur ma bouche, et dit   Voici, ceci a touché tes lèvres ; et ton iniquité est ôtée, et ton péché est purgé.\n8 Et j'ai entendu la voix du Seigneur, disant   Qui enverrai-je, et qui ira pour nous ? Alors je dis   Me voici ; envoie-moi  **\n\n\n\nCHAPITRE 7  **\nPRÊCHE CE QUE JÉSUS ET LES APÔTRES ONT PRÊCHÉ  **\nToute personne désireuse d'entrer au ciel doit prêcher ce que Jésus-Christ et ses apôtres ont prêché. Vous aurez également le même résultat qu'eux et vous recevrez sa recommandation en tant que bon et fidèle ministre. Voici les messages clés de la Bible à prêcher et à enseigner en plus de toute la Bible. Les prédicateurs doivent prêcher l'évangile équilibré et travailler dans la parole et la doctrine pour présenter chaque homme parfait en Jésus-Christ à Dieu le Père pour sa possession éternelle.  **\n2 Timothée 3 verset 15 à 17   **\n15 Et que, dès ton enfance, tu connais les saintes écritures, qui peuvent te rendre sage à salut par la foi qui est en Jésus-Christ.\n16 Toute Ecriture est inspirée de Dieu, et utile pour enseigner, pour convaincre, pour corriger, pour instruire dans la justice.\n17 Afin que l'homme de Dieu soit parfait, entièrement pourvu à toutes les bonnes œuvres  **\nPendant que vous étudiez la Bible, notez attentivement le message cardinal suivant prêché par Christ et l'apôtre inspiré par l'esprit de Christ présenté ici. Croyez et mettez en pratique toute la parole de Dieu afin d'avoir accès au ciel et au royaume éternel de Dieu.  **\nDeuxième Pierre 1 verset 8 à 11   **\n8 Car si ces choses sont en vous et abondent, elles font de vous que vous ne serez ni stériles ni stériles dans la connaissance de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.\n9 Mais celui qui manque de ces choses est aveugle, ne peut voir de loin et a oublié qu'il a été purgé de ses anciens péchés.\n10 C'est pourquoi, frères, appliquez-vous plutôt à affermir votre appel et votre élection, car si vous faites ces choses, vous ne faillirez jamais ;\n11 Car c'est ainsi qu'il vous sera donné abondamment l'entrée dans le royaume éternel de notre Seigneur et Sauveur Jésus Christ.  **\nVeuillez prêcher le message biblique complet aux autres également pour leur salut, leur sainteté et leur vie éternelle. Beaucoup ignorent ces vérités  **\nDeuxième Timothée 2 verset 2  **\nEt les choses que tu as entendues de moi parmi de nombreux témoins, les mêmes te confient à des hommes fidèles, qui pourront aussi enseigner aux autres.  **\nMatthieu 28 verset 18 à 20  **\n18 Et Jésus, s'approchant, leur parla, disant   Tout pouvoir m'a été donné dans le ciel et sur la terre.\n19 Allez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit.\n20 Enseignez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai prescrit. Et voici, je suis avec vous pour toujours, jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amin  **\nPremier Timothée 4 verset 6  **\nSi tu rappelles ces choses aux frères, tu seras un bon ministre de Jésus-Christ, nourri des paroles de la foi et de la bonne doctrine, auxquelles tu es parvenu  **\n2 Timothée 4 versets 11 à 16  **\n11 Ces choses ordonnent et enseignent.\n12 Que personne ne méprise ta jeunesse; mais sois un exemple pour les croyants, en parole, en conversation, en charité, en esprit, en pureté.\n13 Jusqu'à ce que je vienne, sois attentif à la lecture, à l'exhortation, à l'enseignement.\n14 Ne néglige pas le don qui est en toi, qui t'a été donné par prophétie, avec l'imposition des mains du presbytère.\n15 Méditez sur ces choses ; donne-toi 16 Prends garde à toi-même et à la doctrine; continuez en eux, car en faisant cela, vous vous sauverez vous-même et ceux qui vous écoutent.  **\n\n\nLA TRINITE ET LA SUPREMATIE DE LA DIVINITE  **\nLa Sainte Ecriture    **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   La Sainte Écriture est la parole de Dieu écrite par l'inspiration de Dieu, ayant l'autorité finale sur toutes les questions qui concernent les hommes sur la terre et sur les doctrines, les activités et l'administration de l'Église du Christ dans le monde. . L'Écriture est pure, parfaite, puissante et éternelle. Ses commandements s'imposent à tous les hommes. Ses prophéties ne manquent jamais. Ses promesses sont fiables. Son message central est Jésus-Christ et son offre est éternelle avec Dieu. Sa vie est justice et sainteté en Christ. Sa promesse ultime est le paradis. Ses auteurs étaient parfaitement inspirés par le Saint-Esprit. L'Ecriture Sainte, la Bible, est composée de 66 livres, commençant par le livre de la Genèse et se terminant par le livre de l'Apocalypse. L'Ecriture est appelée la parole de Dieu, ou la parole de Christ. Rien ne doit y être ajouté et rien ne doit en être retranché. Toutes les prophéties et révélations dans l'église doivent être authentifiées par l'Écriture.    **\nMatthieu 5 verset 17 à 20   **\n17 Ne pensez pas que je sois venu abolir la loi ou les prophètes, je ne suis pas venu abolir, mais accomplir.\n18 Car en vérité, je vous le dis, jusqu'à ce que le ciel et la terre passent, un iota ou un trait ne passera en aucune manière de la loi, jusqu'à ce que tout soit accompli.\n19 Quiconque donc enfreindra l'un de ces plus petits commandements, et en enseignera aux hommes, sera appelé le plus petit dans le royaume des cieux, mais quiconque les fera et les enseignera, celui-là sera appelé grand dans le royaume des cieux.\n20 Car je vous dis que, si votre justice ne dépasse pas la justice des scribes et des pharisiens, vous n'entrerez en aucun cas dans le royaume des cieux.  **\n2 Timothée 3 verset 15 à 17   **\n15 Et que, dès ton enfance, tu connais les saintes écritures, qui peuvent te rendre sage à salut par la foi qui est en Jésus-Christ.\n16 Toute Ecriture est inspirée de Dieu, et utile pour enseigner, pour convaincre, pour corriger, pour instruire dans la justice;\n17 Afin que l'homme de Dieu soit parfait, entièrement pourvu à toutes les bonnes œuvres.  **\nTrinité de la Divinité  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Dieu est une Personne en trois individus distincts appelés le Père, le Fils et le Saint-Esprit, et trois individus distincts en une seule Personne appelée Dieu, Seigneur, Jéhovah, Créateur. Le Père, le Fils Jésus et le Saint-Esprit existent d'éternité en éternité. Le Fils est venu dans le monde pour sauver les hommes du péché, de Satan et de la mort éternelle et leur donner la vie éternelle, la vie de Dieu. Sur terre, il portait le nom de Jésus-Christ.  **\nMatthieu 28 verset 19  **\nAllez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit  **\nMarc 12 verset 29  **\nEt Jésus lui répondit   Le premier de tous les commandements est   Écoute, ô Israël ; Le Seigneur notre Dieu est un seul Seigneur.  **\n Premier Jean 5 verset 7  **\nCar il y en a trois qui rendent témoignage dans les cieux, le Père, la Parole et le Saint-Esprit, et ces trois sont un  **\nVictoire complète du Christ sur Satan  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Jésus-Christ est le Seigneur et le créateur de Satan et de son hôte démoniaque. Jésus a détruit Satan et son royaume sur la croix. Il a fait cela pour libérer totalement les hommes du pouvoir et de l'influence de Satan. En Christ, ceux qui sont opprimés par le diable reçoivent une délivrance complète.  **\nJésus est Seigneur au ciel, sur terre et sous la terre. A la mention de Son nom, Satan et son royaume s'inclinent dans un abandon total ! La victoire triomphale de Christ sur Satan et son royaume a été donnée à tous ceux qui croient en lui. Les croyants peuvent exercer cette autorité par la foi en la parole de Dieu et l'utilisation du nom de Jésus.  **\nLuc 10 verset 17 à 20  **\n17 Et les soixante-dix revinrent avec joie, disant   Seigneur, même les démons nous sont soumis par ton nom.\n18 Et il leur dit   Je vis Satan comme un éclair tomber du ciel.\n19 Voici, je vous donne le pouvoir de marcher sur les serpents et les scorpions, et sur toute la puissance de l'ennemi, et rien ne vous fera aucun mal.\n20 Malgré cela, ne vous réjouissez pas de ce que les esprits vous sont soumis ; mais réjouissez-vous plutôt, car vos noms sont écrits dans les cieux  **\nColossiens 2 verset 14, 15  **\n14 effaçant l'écriture des ordonnances qui était contre nous, qui nous était contraire, et l'ôta du chemin, la clouant à sa croix ;\n15 Et ayant gâté des principautés et des puissances, il les montra ouvertement, triomphant d'elles en elle  **\nLe jugement de Dieu sur les pécheurs  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Dieu est le grand et juste juge. Les pécheurs et les rétrogrades subissent son jugement d'une manière ou d'une autre dans ce monde pour leurs œuvres mauvaises et méchantes et dans la vie à venir, il les condamnera à une condamnation éternelle.  **\nLuc 12 verset 5  **\nMais je vous avertirai de qui vous aurez peur   craignez celui qui, après avoir tué, a le pouvoir de jeter dans la géhenne ; oui, je vous le dis, craignez-le.  **\nHébreux 10 verset 30, 31  **\n30 Car nous connaissons celui qui a dit   La vengeance m'appartient, je rendrai, dit l'Éternel. Et encore, le Seigneur jugera son peuple.\n31 C'est une chose terrible de tomber entre les mains du Dieu vivant  **\nLes récompenses de Dieu pour les justes Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Dieu récompense les bonnes actions faites par Ses enfants justes. Ce serait une injustice de la part de Dieu de ne pas récompenser les œuvres de justice accomplies par ses enfants justes. C'est pourquoi les croyants ne doivent pas se lasser de bien faire, car ils seront récompensés. Dieu récompense les justes à la fois dans cette vie et dans la vie à venir.  **\nMarc 10 verset 28 à 30  **\n28 Alors Pierre se mit à lui dire   Voici, nous avons tout quitté et nous t'avons suivi.\n29 Et Jésus répondit et dit   En vérité, je vous le dis, il n'y a personne qui ait quitté sa maison, ou ses frères, ou ses sœurs, ou son père, ou sa mère, ou sa femme, ou ses enfants, ou ses terres, à cause de moi et de l'évangile. ,\n30 Mais il recevra maintenant au centuple, en ce temps-ci, des maisons, et des frères, et des sœurs, et des mères, et des enfants, et des terres, avec des persécutions ; et dans le monde à venir la vie éternelle  **\nHébreux 6 verset 9 à 18  **\n9 Mais, bien-aimés, nous sommes persuadés de vous de meilleures choses et de choses qui accompagnent le salut, bien que nous parlions ainsi.\n10 Car Dieu n'est pas injuste d'oublier votre travail et votre travail d'amour, que vous avez montrés envers son nom, en ce que vous avez servi les saints, et que vous faites le service.\n11 Et nous désirons que chacun de vous montre la même diligence à la pleine assurance de l'espérance jusqu'à la fin ;\n12 afin que vous ne soyez pas paresseux, mais que vous suiviez ceux qui, par la foi et la patience, héritent des promesses.\n13 Car lorsque Dieu fit la promesse à Abraham, parce qu'il ne pouvait jurer par un plus grand, il jura par lui-même,\n14 Disant   Certainement, en bénissant, je te bénirai, et en multipliant, je te multiplierai.\n15 Et ainsi, après avoir patiemment enduré, il obtint la promesse.\n16 Car les hommes jurent par le plus grand ; et un serment de confirmation est pour eux la fin de toute querelle.\n17 Où Dieu, voulant montrer plus abondamment aux héritiers de la promesse l'immuabilité de son conseil, le confirma par un serment ;\n18 Afin que par deux choses immuables, dans lesquelles il était impossible à Dieu de mentir, nous ayons une forte consolation, nous qui avons fui pour nous réfugier dans l'espérance placée devant nous  **\nLe salut en Jésus-Christ seul  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Ce n'est qu'en Jésus que les hommes peuvent trouver le chemin, la vérité et la vie éternelle. Il est le seul chemin vers Dieu dans le ciel. Les êtres humains sur terre ne peuvent être sauvés du péché et de la damnation éternelle dans le feu de l'enfer que par Jésus. Il n'y a pas de religion, de prophète, de sage ou de nom dans tout l'univers qui puisse apporter le salut du péché et de la mort éternelle. Jésus est le Sauveur et Seigneur universel.  **\nJean 8 verset 24  **\nJe vous ai donc dit que vous mourrez dans vos péchés, car si vous ne croyez pas que je suis lui, vous mourrez dans vos péchés  **\nActes 4 verset 10 à 12  **\n10 Sachez à vous tous, et à tout le peuple d'Israël, que c'est par le nom de Jésus-Christ de Nazareth, que vous avez crucifié, que Dieu a ressuscité des morts, que par lui cet homme se tient ici entier devant vous.\n11 C'est la pierre qui a été rejetée par vous, bâtisseurs, qui est devenue la tête de l'angle.\n12 Il n'y a de salut en aucun autre, car il n'y a sous le ciel aucun autre nom donné parmi les hommes, par lequel nous devions être sauvés. La Souffrance, la Mort et la Résurrection de Jésus-Christ  **\n\nCHAPITRE 8  **\nLA JUSTICE ET LA SAINTETE EN CHRIST  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   En tant qu'homme sur terre vivant parmi les hommes, Jésus a souffert entre les mains d'hommes méchants. Sa revendication en tant que Seigneur et Sauveur du monde et Fils de Dieu a été rejetée. Il a été crucifié sur la croix. Il est mort, a été enterré, mais est ressuscité le troisième jour et est retourné au ciel. Il a satisfait ce que Dieu exigeait pour le salut des hommes du péché et de la damnation éternelle et pour leur possession de la vie éternelle. Maintenant, les hommes dans le monde peuvent être sauvés et réconciliés avec Dieu par Jésus-Christ.  **\nMatthieu 16 verset 21  **\nA partir de ce moment-là, Jésus commença à montrer à ses disciples comment il devait aller à Jérusalem, souffrir beaucoup des anciens, des principaux sacrificateurs et des scribes, être tué et ressusciter le troisième jour  **\n1 Corinthiens 15 versets 1 à 4  **\n1 De plus, frères, je vous annonce l'évangile que je vous ai prêché, que vous avez aussi reçu et dans lequel vous vous tenez ;\n2 Par quoi aussi vous êtes sauvés, si vous gardez en mémoire ce que je vous ai prêché, à moins que vous n'ayez cru en vain.\n3 Car je vous ai livré premièrement ce que j'ai aussi reçu, comment Christ est mort pour nos péchés selon les Écritures ;\n4 Et qu'il a été enseveli, et qu'il est ressuscité le troisième jour selon les écritures  **\nRepentir du péché  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Un pécheur qui désire le salut de ses péchés et une nouvelle vie de justice trouvée en Christ doit haïr ses péchés et s'en détourner. Les œuvres de la chair doivent être rejetées   fornication, idolâtrie, sorcellerie, ivresse, corruption, méchanceté, vol, mensonge, colère, médisance, etc. Il faut se détourner complètement du péché pour recevoir l'offre gratuite de salut qui est dans Jésus Christ.  **\nLuc 13 verset 3, je vous le dis, non; mais, à moins que vous ne vous repentiez, vous périrez tous également.  **\nActes 8 verset 22, 23  **\n22 Repentez-vous donc de cette méchanceté, et priez Dieu, si peut-être la pensée de votre cœur vous est pardonnée.\n23 Car je vois que tu es dans le fiel de l'amertume et dans le lien de l'iniquité.  **\nLa foi en Christ pour le salut Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Un pécheur qui s'est repenti de ses péchés doit exercer sa foi au Seigneur et Sauveur Jésus-Christ afin de recevoir le salut du péché et le pouvoir de mener une vie juste. Cela nécessite d'inviter Jésus dans sa vie pour être son Seigneur et Sauveur. Le salut du péché est également connu comme le pardon du péché, la nouvelle naissance, la nouvelle naissance, la régénération, la justification et la réconciliation.  **\nJean 3 verset 14 à 18  **\n14 Et comme Moïse éleva le serpent dans le désert, ainsi le Fils de l'homme doit-il être élevé ;\n15 Afin que quiconque croit en lui ne périsse pas, mais qu'il ait la vie éternelle.\n16 Car Dieu a tant aimé le monde qu'il a donné son Fils unique, afin que quiconque croit en lui ne périsse pas, mais qu'il ait la vie éternelle.\n17 Car Dieu n'a pas envoyé son Fils dans le monde pour condamner le monde ; mais que le monde par lui puisse être sauvé.\n18 Celui qui croit en lui n'est pas condamné, mais celui qui ne croit pas est déjà condamné, parce qu'il n'a pas cru au nom du Fils unique de Dieu.  **\nJean 1 verset 9 à 13  **\n9 C'était la vraie Lumière, qui éclaire tout homme qui vient dans le monde.\n10 Il était dans le monde, et le monde a été fait par lui, et le monde ne l'a pas connu.\n11 Il est venu chez les siens, et les siens ne l'ont pas reçu.\n12 Mais à tous ceux qui l'ont reçu, il leur a donné le pouvoir de devenir fils de Dieu, même à ceux qui croient en son nom ;\n13 Qui sont nés, non du sang, ni de la volonté de la chair, ni de la volonté de l'homme, mais de Dieu.  **\nRestitution   Corriger les mauvaises actions passées  **\nGenèse 20 versets 1 à 18 ; Lévitique 6 verset 1 à 7 ; Ézéchiel 33 verset 14 à 16 ; Luc 19 versets 1 à 10.\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Une personne qui a donné sa vie à Jésus doit apporter des modifications ou rectifier les erreurs de sa vie là où les Écritures le précisent. Il s'agit notamment de faire la paix avec des personnes offensées, de présenter des excuses, de restituer des biens volés, d'avouer des crimes cachés à des personnes appropriées, de faire des corrections dans le mariage (en cas de mariage non biblique, comme épouser deux femmes, épouser la femme ou le mari de quelqu'un d'autre, divorcer de sa première femme ou mari), en renonçant à de fausses déclarations, certificats ou résultats. Ceci est nécessaire pour avoir la paix de la justice et une conscience sans offense envers Dieu et l'homme.  **\nMatthieu 5 verset 23 à 26   **\n23 Si donc tu apportes ton offrande à l'autel, et que là tu te souviennes que ton frère a quelque chose contre toi;\n24 Laisse là ton offrande devant l'autel, et va; réconcilie-toi d'abord avec ton frère, puis viens offrir ton offrande.\n25 Accorde-toi promptement avec ton adversaire, pendant que tu es en chemin avec lui ; de peur que l'adversaire ne te livre au juge, et que le juge ne te livre à l'officier, et que tu ne sois jeté en prison.\n26 En vérité, je te le dis, tu ne sortiras point de là, que tu n'aies payé le dernier sou.\nActes 24 verset 16 Et c'est à cela que je m'exerce, à avoir toujours une conscience sans offense envers Dieu et envers les hommes  **\nPhilémon 1 verset 17 à 19   **\n17 Si donc tu me considères comme un associé, reçois-le comme moi-même.\n18 S'il t'a fait du tort, ou s'il te doit quelque chose, mets cela sur mon compte;\n19 Moi, Paul, je l'ai écrit de ma propre main, je le rendrai, quoique je ne te dise pas comment tu me dois toi-même en plus  **\nSanctification du cœur Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Celui qui a cru en Christ a encore besoin d'une expérience de grâce appelée sanctification. Jésus a prié pour que ses disciples soient sanctifiés. La sanctification est une expérience qu'un croyant reçoit de Dieu par la foi. Le croyant qui est sanctifié reçoit une purification intérieure des restes du péché dans son cœur et est purgé des luttes intérieures et de la souillure de l'orgueil, de la colère, de la méchanceté, de la convoitise, de l'avidité, de l'amertume, etc. qui surmonte souvent le croyant. La sanctification fait chez un croyant ce que le rinçage fait dans un linge qui a été lavé avec un détergent. Après l'expérience du salut, le croyant a besoin de l'expérience de la sanctification pour la pureté et la sainteté du cœur. Un croyant a besoin de consécration, de prière et de foi pour recevoir cette expérience de Dieu. Heureux ceux qui ont le coeur pur car ils verront Dieu. L'expérience de la sanctification rend le cœur du croyant propre et pur. La sanctification signifie également la consécration ou le dévouement à l'usage de Dieu. Christ s'est consacré au salut et à la sainteté de l'homme.  **\nJean 17 verset 16 à 20   **\n16 Ils ne sont pas du monde, comme je ne suis pas du monde.\n17 Sanctifie-les par ta vérité; ta parole est vérité. 18 Comme tu m'as envoyé dans le monde, je les ai aussi envoyés dans le monde.\n19 Et je me sanctifie moi-même à cause d'eux, afin qu'eux aussi soient sanctifiés par la vérité.\n20 Je ne prie pas pour eux seuls, mais aussi pour ceux qui croiront en moi par leur parole;  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 25 à 27   **\n25 Maris, aimez vos femmes, comme Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle;\n26 Afin qu'il la sanctifie et la purifie par le lavage d'eau par la parole,\n27 Afin qu'il se la présente comme une église glorieuse, sans tache, ni ride, ni rien de semblable; mais qu'il soit saint et sans défaut  **\nLe fruit de l'esprit  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Ceux qui croient en Christ ont l'Esprit de Christ qui habite en eux. Cet Esprit répand en eux des vertus spirituelles d'amour, de joie, de paix, de foi, de bonté, de douceur, de douceur, de patience, de maîtrise de soi. Chaque croyant devrait se prévaloir du développement du fruit de l'Esprit pour faire briller sa lumière devant les hommes dans la justice et la sainteté afin qu'ils puissent glorifier Dieu en son nom.  **\nMatthieu 5 verset 14 à 16   **\n14 Vous êtes la lumière du monde. Une ville située sur une colline ne peut pas être cachée.\n15 On n'allume pas non plus une chandelle pour la mettre sous un boisseau, mais sur un chandelier; et il éclaire tous ceux qui sont dans la maison.\n16 Que votre lumière brille ainsi devant les hommes, afin qu'ils voient vos bonnes œuvres et glorifient votre Père qui est dans les cieux  **\nGalates 5 verset 22 à 25   **\n22 Mais le fruit de l'Esprit, c'est l'amour, la joie, la paix, la longanimité, la douceur, la bonté, la foi,\n23 Douceur, tempérance   il n'y a pas de loi contre de telles choses.\n24 Et ceux qui sont à Christ ont crucifié la chair avec les affections et les convoitises.\n25 Si nous vivons par l'Esprit, marchons aussi par l'Esprit  **\nLes Croyants Ne Sont Pas Du Monde  **\nGenèse 35 verset 1 à 5 ; Exode 33 verset 4 à 6 ; Proverbes 7 verset 10 ; Esaïe 3 verset 16 à 24 ; premier Timothée 2 versets 18 à 10 ; premier Pierre 3 verset 3 à 4; Nombres 31 verset 50. Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Ceux qui ont accepté le Seigneur Jésus-Christ comme leur Seigneur et Sauveur sont devenus enfants de Dieu. Ils ne sont pas du monde et ne doivent donc pas aimer le monde ni les choses du monde. Ils ne doivent pas parler, marcher, s'habiller ou agir comme les pécheurs du monde. Ils doivent éviter les vêtements, les vêtements, le maquillage et les styles mondains. Ils ne doivent pas utiliser de bijoux comprenant des boucles d'oreilles, des anneaux de nez, des colliers, des chaînes, des bracelets, des bagues, des alliances, et perles. Ils ne doivent pas perm ou jerry curl leurs cheveux. Ils ne doivent pas utiliser d'accessoires pour cheveux, de tissage, de cortex, de rouges à lèvres. Ils ne doivent pas utiliser de robes révélatrices de corps. Les femmes ne doivent pas porter de pantalons, minijupes et toutes sortes de robes indécentes. Les hommes aussi ne doivent pas se couper les cheveux dans des styles mondains ni s'habiller de façon impie. Leurs cœurs ne doivent pas être fixés sur les richesses ou les choses fantaisistes de ce monde. Les croyants doivent s'abstenir de la musique et de la danse mondaines et ne doivent pas apporter cela dans l'église pour le culte de Dieu   **\nMatthieu 6 verset 19 à 24   **\n19 Ne vous amassez pas de trésors sur la terre, où la teigne et la rouille corrompent, et où les voleurs percent et dérobent;\n20 Mais amassez-vous des trésors dans le ciel, où ni teignes ni rouille ne corrompent, et où les voleurs ne percent ni ne dérobent;\n21 Car là où est ton trésor, là aussi sera ton coeur. 22 La lumière du corps est l'œil ; si donc ton œil est simple, tout ton corps sera illuminé.\n23 Mais si ton œil est mauvais, tout ton corps sera dans les ténèbres. Si donc la lumière qui est en toi est ténèbres, combien grandes sont ces ténèbres !\n24 Nul ne peut servir deux maîtres   car ou il haïra l'un et aimera l'autre ; ou bien il s'attachera à l'un et méprisera l'autre. Vous ne pouvez pas servir Dieu et Mammon.\nJean 17 verset 14 Je leur ai donné ta parole; et le monde les a haïs, parce qu'ils ne sont pas du monde, comme je ne suis pas du monde.  **\nPremier Jean 2 verset 15 à 17  **\n15 N'aimez pas le monde, ni les choses qui sont dans le monde. Si quelqu'un aime le monde, l'amour du Père n'est pas en lui.\n16 Car tout ce qui est dans le monde, la convoitise de la chair, et la convoitise des yeux, et l'orgueil de la vie, n'est pas du Père, mais est du monde.\n17 Et le monde s'en va, et sa convoitise ; mais celui qui fait la volonté de Dieu demeure éternellement  **\nApocalypse 17 verset 1 à 5   **\n1 Et l'un des sept anges qui avaient les sept coupes vint et me parla, me disant   Viens ici ; Je te montrerai le jugement de la grande prostituée assise sur de nombreuses eaux  **\nVictoire des Croyants sur la Tentation, la Persécution et la Souffrance  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Tous les hommes dans le monde, croyants ou incroyants, subissent la tentation. Le tentateur est le diable. Son but est de faire tomber celui qui est tenté dans le péché et de subir la peine de mort de la part de Dieu. La tentation peut venir de diverses manières et de diverses sources. Il est conseillé aux croyants d'être sobres et vigilants, de veiller et de prier pour ne pas tomber en tentation. Le cas échéant, le croyant peut avoir à fuir l'objet de la tentation, à se couper la main droite, à s'arracher l'œil droit, etc., afin de ne pas tomber dans le péché et damner son âme dans l'enfer éternel. La grâce de Dieu est suffisante pour quiconque se tourne vers lui pour obtenir de l'aide dans les moments de tentation. Encore une fois, il est normal que les disciples de Christ souffrent de persécution et soient confrontés à divers types de défis dans la vie pour la justice et le service chrétien. Ceux-ci doivent être confrontés avec foi, prières et actions de grâces à Dieu qui est notre Consolateur, Soutien, Fournisseur, Sagesse et Victoire. Les croyants doivent relever patiemment les défis de la vie.  **\nMatthieu 26 verset 41   **\nVeillez et priez pour ne pas entrer en tentation, l'esprit est bien disposé, mais la chair est faible  **\nMatthieu 5 verset 9 à 12   **\n9 Heureux les artisans de paix, car ils seront appelés enfants de Dieu.\n10 Heureux ceux qui sont persécutés à cause de la justice, car le royaume des cieux est à eux.\n11 Heureux serez-vous, lorsqu'on vous outragera, qu'on vous persécutera, et qu'on dira faussement de vous toute sorte de mal, à cause de moi.\n12 Réjouissez-vous et soyez dans l'allégresse , car votre récompense dans les cieux est grande, car c'est ainsi qu'ils ont persécuté les prophètes qui ont été avant vous  **\nJacques 1 verset 13 à 15   **\n13 Que personne ne dise, quand il est tenté, je suis tenté par Dieu ; car Dieu ne peut être tenté par le mal, et il ne tente personne.\n14 Mais chacun est tenté, quand il est attiré par sa propre convoitise, et séduit.\n15 Alors, quand la convoitise a conçu, elle enfante le péché; et le péché, quand il est consommé, produit la mort  **\nHébreux 2 verset 18   **\nCar en ce qu'il a lui-même souffert d'être tenté, il peut secourir ceux qui sont tentés  **\n1 Corinthiens 10 verset 13   **\nIl n'y a pas eu de tentation qui vous ait prise, mais celle qui est commune à l'homme   mais Dieu est fidèle, qui ne permettra pas que vous soyez tentés au-delà de ce que vous pouvez ; mais avec la tentation, vous vous frayerez aussi un chemin pour vous échapper, afin que vous puissiez la supporter  **\nSuprématie de l'Amour  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Le plus grand commandement ou le résumé de tous les commandements de Dieu est l'amour. L'homme doit aimer Dieu suprêmement et aimer son prochain comme lui-même. Le véritable amour chrétien pour Dieu et ses semblables garde le croyant libre du péché et du mal. Aimer Dieu signifie garder ses commandements. Les croyants doivent avoir un amour sincère les uns pour les autres et pour leurs semblables.  **\nMarc 12 verset 29 à 33   **\n29 Et Jésus lui répondit   Le premier de tous les commandements est   Écoute, ô Israël ; Le Seigneur notre Dieu est un seul Seigneur  \n30 Et tu aimeras le Seigneur, ton Dieu, de tout ton cœur, et de toute ton âme, et de toute ta pensée, et de toute ta force, c'est le premier commandement.\n31 Et la seconde est semblable, à savoir ceci   Tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi-même. Il n'y a aucun autre commandement plus grand que ceux-ci.\n32 Et le scribe lui dit   Eh bien, maître, tu as dit la vérité , car il y a un seul Dieu ; et il n'y a personne d'autre que lui; 33 Et l'aimer de tout son cœur, et de tout son entendement, et de toute son âme, et de toute sa force, et aimer son prochain comme lui-même, c'est plus que tous les holocaustes et sacrifices entiers  **\nRomains 13 verset 8 à 10   **\n8 Ne devez rien à personne, si ce n'est de vous aimer les uns les autres, car celui qui s'aime a accompli la loi.\n9 Pour cela, tu ne commettras pas d'adultère, tu ne tueras pas, tu ne voleras pas, tu ne porteras pas de faux témoignage, tu ne convoiteras pas; et s'il y a un autre commandement, il est brièvement compris dans ce dicton, à savoir   Tu aimeras ton prochain comme toi-même.\n10 L'amour ne fait aucun mal à son prochain; donc l'amour est l'accomplissement de la loi. Nécessité de prière  **\n\nCHAPITRE 9  **\nPUISSANCE ET AUTORITE DES CROYANTS EN CHRIST  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   La prière est un devoir important pour chaque croyant. La prière c'est parler avec Dieu. Il donne au croyant le privilège de s'exprimer de manière satisfaisante dans une relation d'enfant à père avec Dieu. Par la prière, un croyant peut recevoir de Dieu les désirs de son cœur. La prière donne au croyant le privilège d'affecter la vie des autres dans le monde par la puissance de Dieu. La prière donne au croyant le pouvoir sur Satan et son système méchant. Nous devons prier au nom de Jésus. Nous devons prier selon la parole et les promesses de Dieu, selon la volonté de Dieu. Les hommes doivent toujours prier et ne pas s'évanouir. Les hommes doivent se repentir de tous leurs péchés et venir à la justice pour que leur prière soit exaucée par Dieu.  **\nMatthieu 6 verset 9 à 15   **\n9 C'est pourquoi priez ainsi, notre Père qui es aux cieux, que ton nom soit sanctifié.\n10 Que ton règne vienne. Que ta volonté soit faite sur la terre comme au ciel.\n11 Donne-nous aujourd'hui notre pain quotidien. 12 Et remets-nous nos dettes, comme nous remettons à nos débiteurs.\n13 Et ne nous soumets pas à la tentation, mais délivre-nous du mal ; Car à toi appartiennent le royaume, la puissance et la gloire, pour toujours. Amen.\n14 Car si vous pardonnez aux hommes leurs offenses, votre Père céleste vous pardonnera aussi  \n15 Mais si vous ne pardonnez pas aux hommes leurs offenses, votre Père ne vous pardonnera pas non plus vos offenses  **\nJacques 5 verset 13 à 16   **\n13 Quelqu'un parmi vous est-il affligé ? qu'il prie. Est-ce que tout est joyeux? qu'il chante des psaumes. 14 Y a-t-il parmi vous des malades ? qu'il appelle les anciens de l'église; et qu'ils prient sur lui, en l'oignant d'huile au nom du Seigneur;\n15 Et la prière de la foi sauvera le malade, et le Seigneur le relèvera ; et s'il a commis des péchés, ils lui seront pardonnés.\n16 Confessez vos fautes les uns aux autres, et priez les uns pour les autres, afin que vous soyez guéris. La prière efficace et fervente d'un homme juste est très utile.\n17 Élie était un homme sujet aux mêmes passions que nous, et il priait instamment pour qu'il ne pleuve pas, et il n'a pas plu sur la terre pendant trois ans et six mois. 18 Et il pria de nouveau, et le ciel donna de la pluie, et la terre produisit son fruit  **\nNécessité de Foi  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   La foi est indispensable pour vivre. Pour vivre, il faut avoir foi en Dieu, foi au Seigneur Jésus-Christ, foi en sa parole et ses promesses et foi au nom de Jésus. Dieu ne peut être satisfait que de ceux qui viennent à lui par la foi. Tout est possible à celui qui croit en Dieu et en sa parole.  **\nMarc 11 verset 22 à 24   **\n22 Et Jésus, répondant, leur dit   Ayez foi en Dieu.\n23 Car en vérité, je vous le dis, quiconque dira à cette montagne   éloigne-toi, et sois jeté dans la mer ; et ne doutera pas dans son coeur, mais croira que les choses qu'il dit arriveront; il aura tout ce qu'il dira.\n24 C'est pourquoi je vous dis   Quelles sont les choses que vous désirez, quand vous priez, croyez que vous les recevez, et vous les aurez  **\nRomains 1 verset 16, 17   **\n16 Car je n'ai pas honte de l'évangile de Christ   car c'est la puissance de Dieu pour le salut de quiconque croit ; au Juif d'abord, et aussi au Grec.\n17 Car la justice de Dieu y est révélée de foi en foi ; comme il est écrit   Le juste vivra par la foi  **\nJeûne  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Le jeûne est une discipline spirituelle dans laquelle un croyant s'abstient de nourriture, solide et liquide. Cela peut également impliquer de s'abstenir de boire de l'eau. Le jeûne est une discipline spirituelle exigée de chaque croyant. Le jeûne renforce la vie spirituelle des croyants. Il y a certaines circonstances ou forces du mal qui ne se soumettent que lorsque la prière est soutenue par le jeûne.  **\nMatthieu 17 verset 19 à 21   **\n19 Alors les disciples s'approchèrent de Jésus à part, et dirent   Pourquoi n'avons-nous pas pu le chasser ?\n20 Et Jésus leur dit   À cause de votre incrédulité ; car en vérité, je vous le dis   Si vous avez la foi comme un grain de sénevé, vous direz à cette montagne   Éloignez-vous d'ici là-bas ; et il enlèvera; et rien ne vous sera impossible.\n21 Cependant cette espèce ne sort que par la prière et le jeûne  **\nActes 13 verset 1 à 3   **\n1 Or il y avait dans l'Église qui était à Antioche certains prophètes et docteurs ; comme Barnabas, et Siméon qui s'appelait Niger, et Lucius de Cyrène, et Manaen, qui avait été élevé avec Hérode le tétrarque, et Saul\n2 Pendant qu'ils servaient le Seigneur et jeûnaient, le Saint-Esprit dit   Séparez-moi Barnabas et Saul pour l'œuvre à laquelle je les ai appelés.\n3 Et après avoir jeûné et prié, et leur avoir imposé les mains, ils les renvoyèrent  **\nGuérison, Délivrance, Miracles Et Prospérité En Christ  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Les hommes peuvent trouver la guérison, la délivrance et des miracles par la foi en Christ. Le Christ n'a pas seulement souffert et est mort pour fournir le salut du péché, mais aussi pour rendre la santé aux malades, délivrer les opprimés du diable et subvenir aux besoins des hommes sur la terre. Ses bénédictions et sa prospérité sont librement accessibles à tous ceux qui viennent à lui avec foi. Par la foi en Jésus-Christ, nous pouvons être guéris de toutes sortes de maladies et de toutes sortes de maladies. Par la foi en Christ, nous pouvons prospérer dans l'œuvre de nos mains.  **\nLuc 4 verset 18, 19   **\n18 L'Esprit du Seigneur est sur moi, parce qu'il m'a oint pour annoncer la bonne nouvelle aux pauvres ; Il m'a envoyé pour guérir les cœurs brisés, pour prêcher la délivrance aux captifs, et le rétablissement de la vue aux aveugles, pour remettre en liberté ceux qui sont meurtris, 19 Pour prêcher l'année de grâce du Seigneur.  **\nTroisième Jean 1 verset 2   **\nBien-aimé, je souhaite par-dessus tout que tu prospères et sois en bonne santé, comme ton âme prospère  **\n\nÉVANGÉLISATION ET SERVICE CHRÉTIEN  **\nBaptême du Saint-Esprit   **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Celui qui est né de nouveau se voit promettre le baptême du Saint-Esprit. C'est ce qu'on appelle la promesse du Père. Le baptême du Saint-Esprit est le remplissage d'un croyant avec la puissance du Saint-Esprit. Cela est nécessaire pour un service chrétien efficace et fructueux. La preuve du baptême du Saint-Esprit est le parler en langues par l'habilitation du Saint-Esprit. Chaque croyant a le Saint-Esprit appelé l'Esprit de Christ en lui. Mais tous les croyants ne sont pas baptisés ou remplis du Saint-Esprit. Pour recevoir le baptême du Saint-Esprit, un croyant doit croire que c'est la volonté de Dieu pour lui. Dans la faim et la soif du baptême du Saint-Esprit, il a besoin de chercher la face du Seigneur dans la prière et la foi importunes pour cette expérience.  **\nActes 1 verset 5, 8   **\n5 Car Jean a véritablement baptisé d'eau; mais vous serez baptisés du Saint-Esprit dans peu de jours.\n8 Mais vous recevrez une puissance, après que le Saint-Esprit sera venu sur vous, et vous serez mes témoins à Jérusalem, et dans toute la Judée, et à Samarie, et jusqu'à l'extrémité de la terre.  **\nActes 2 verset 4, 38, 39   **\n4 Et ils furent tous remplis du Saint-Esprit, et se mirent à parler en d'autres langues, selon que l'Esprit leur donnait de s'exprimer.\n38 Alors Pierre leur dit   Repentez-vous, et que chacun de vous soit baptisé au nom de Jésus-Christ pour la rémission des péchés, et vous recevrez le don du Saint-Esprit.\n39 Car la promesse est pour vous, et pour vos enfants, et pour tous ceux qui sont au loin, en aussi grand nombre que le Seigneur notre Dieu les appellera  **\nLa Grande Commission  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Tous les disciples du Christ sont mandatés par le Seigneur pour aller dans le monde et prêcher l'évangile à toute créature humaine. La commission donnée consiste à aller annoncer partout aux pécheurs la bonne nouvelle du salut en Christ, à baptiser ceux qui acceptent ou croient au Seigneur Jésus-Christ et à enseigner aux croyants toute la parole de Dieu. Cela implique l'évangélisation personnelle, l'évangélisation des croisades, l'évangélisation de la littérature, l'évangélisation des médias et toutes les manières légitimes de transmettre l'évangile de Jésus au monde qui périt. La grande commission a deux composantes. Premièrement, amener les pécheurs à la foi en Christ pour leur salut du péché. Deuxièmement, enseigner aux croyants ou disciples toute la parole de Dieu écrite dans la Bible. Cela est nécessaire pour leur liberté, leur droiture, leur sainteté, leur victoire, leur fécondité et leur vie éternelle. Il ne suffit pas pour un homme de naître de nouveau, il a besoin de connaître et de pratiquer les vérités scripturaires et les doctrines requises pour la sécurité de sa foi chrétienne. Sans une pleine obéissance à chaque parole de Dieu et à la sainteté, personne ne verra le Seigneur. Il n'est pas bon d'être dans l'ignorance. L'ignorance des exigences de la vie éternelle nous empêchera de la posséder. Tous les vrais croyants et églises travaillent pour une seule cause et devraient donc apprendre à travailler ensemble là où c'est nécessaire pour gagner le monde pour Jésus. La grande commission demande de la sagesse et du dévouement chez les disciples du Christ.  **\nMarc 16 verset 15 à 18   **\n15 Et il leur dit   Allez par tout le monde, et prêchez l'Evangile à toute créature. 16 Celui qui croira et sera baptisé sera sauvé; mais celui qui ne croira pas sera damné.\n17 Et voici les miracles qui accompagneront ceux qui auront cru ; En mon nom, ils chasseront les démons; ils parleront de nouvelles langues; 18 Ils prendront des serpents; et s'ils boivent quelque chose de mortel, cela ne leur fera pas de mal; ils imposeront les mains aux malades, et ils seront guéris  **\nMatthieu 28 verset 18 à 20   **\n18 Et Jésus, s'approchant, leur parla, disant   Tout pouvoir m'a été donné dans le ciel et sur la terre.\n19 Allez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit ;\n20 Enseignez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai prescrit ; et voici, je suis toujours avec vous, même jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amen.  **\n2 Timothée 4 verset 1 à 5   **\n1 Je te charge donc devant Dieu, et devant le Seigneur Jésus-Christ, qui jugera les vivants et les morts à son apparition et à son royaume ;\n2 Prêchez la parole; être instantané en saison, hors saison ; reprendre, réprimander, exhorter avec toute patience et doctrine.\n3 Car le temps viendra où ils ne supporteront pas la saine doctrine; mais après leurs propres convoitises ils s'entasseront des maîtres, ayant les oreilles qui démangent;\n4 Et ils détourneront leurs oreilles de la vérité, et se tourneront vers les fables.\n5 Mais toi, veille en toutes choses, endure les afflictions, fais l'œuvre d'un évangéliste, fais preuve de plein exercice de ton ministère  **\n1 Corinthiens 12 verset 27, 28   **\n27 Maintenant, vous êtes le corps de Christ, et ses membres en particulier.\n28 Et Dieu a établi quelques-uns dans l'Église, premièrement des apôtres, deuxièmement des prophètes, troisièmement des docteurs, après cela des miracles, puis des dons de guérisons, des secours, des gouvernements, des diversités de langues  **\n Appel ministériel  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Tous les croyants reçoivent un ou plusieurs dons pour servir au service de Dieu. C'est Dieu qui distribue ces dons à Ses enfants selon Sa volonté. Chaque croyant devrait échanger avec son don de grâce.\nCependant, il y a un appel spécial à une fonction et un office spéciaux que Dieu donne à qui Il veut. Aucun homme ne s'attribue cet honneur. Les choses de Dieu ne sont pas charnelles mais spirituelles. C'est Dieu qui appelle à la fonction d'apôtre, de prophète, d'évangéliste, de pasteur et d'enseignant. C'est Dieu qui connaît et appelle les gens à être le surveillant général des églises et des ministères. Assumer une fonction que Dieu ne vous a pas confiée, c'est nuire à la conduite de Christ et à la vie des hommes. Par conséquent, la fonction ministérielle n'est pas seulement atteinte par le désir, mais par des qualifications bibliques et un appel divin. Dieu équipe ses ministres de dons spirituels pour un ministère efficace parmi les hommes.  **\nMatthieu 4 verset 18 à 22   **\n18 Et Jésus, marchant le long de la mer de Galilée, vit deux frères, Simon appelé Pierre, et André son frère, jetant un filet dans la mer ; car ils étaient pêcheurs.\n19 Et il leur dit   Suivez-moi, et je vous ferai pêcheurs d'hommes. 20 Et aussitôt ils laissèrent leurs filets et le suivirent.\n21 Et partant de là, il vit deux autres frères, Jacques, fils de Zébédée, et Jean, son frère, dans une barque avec Zébédée, leur père, raccommodant leurs filets ; et il les a appelés.\n22 Et aussitôt ils laissèrent le bateau et leur père, et le suivirent  **\nJean 15 verset 1, 2   **\n1 Je suis la vraie vigne, et mon Père est le vigneron. 2 Tout sarment en moi qui ne porte pas de fruit, il l'enlève et tout sarment qui porte du fruit, il le purifie, afin qu'il porte plus de fruit  **\nEphésiens 4 verset 7 à 14   **\n7 Mais à chacun de nous la grâce est donnée selon la mesure du don de Christ. 8 C'est pourquoi il dit   Lorsqu'il est monté en haut, il a emmené des captifs captifs, et a fait des dons aux hommes.\n11 Et il donna des apôtres ; et certains, prophètes; et certains, évangélistes; et certains, pasteurs et enseignants;\n12 pour le perfectionnement des saints, pour l'oeuvre du ministère, pour l'édification du corps de Christ;\n13 jusqu'à ce que nous soyons tous parvenus à l'unité de la foi et de la connaissance du Fils de Dieu, à un homme parfait, à la mesure de la stature de la plénitude de Christ ;\n14 Que désormais nous ne soyons plus des enfants, ballottés çà et là, et emportés à tout vent de doctrine, par la tromperie des hommes, et par la ruse rusée, par laquelle ils guettent pour tromper;  **\nPremier Timothée 3 verset 1 à 13   **\n1 C'est un vrai dicton   Si quelqu'un désire l'office d'évêque, il désire une bonne œuvre.\n2 Abishop doit donc être irréprochable, époux d'une seule femme, vigilant, sobre, de bonne conduite, hospitalier, apte à enseigner;\n3 Pas adonné au vin, pas de frappeur, pas avide de lucre sale; mais patient, pas bagarreur, pas cupide ;\n4 Celui qui gouverne bien sa propre maison, ayant ses enfants soumis avec toute gravité;\n5 (Car si un homme ne sait pas gouverner sa propre maison, comment prendra-t-il soin de l'Eglise de Dieu ?)\n6 Pas un novice, de peur qu'enflé d'orgueil il ne tombe dans la condamnation du diable.\n7 De plus, il doit avoir un bon rapport de ceux qui sont à l'extérieur ; de peur qu'il ne tombe dans l'opprobre et le piège du diable.\n8 De même, les diacres doivent être graves, non doubles, non adonnés à beaucoup de vin, non avides de somptueux lucres;\n9 Tenir le mystère de la foi dans une conscience pure.\n10 Et que ceux-ci aussi soient d'abord éprouvés; qu'ils usent alors de l'office de diacre, étant trouvés irréprochables. 11 De même leurs femmes doivent être graves, non médisantes, sobres, fidèles en toutes choses.\n12 Que les diacres soient les maris d'une seule femme, gouvernant bien leurs enfants et leurs propres maisons.\n13 Car ceux qui ont bien exercé l'office de diacre s'acquièrent un bon degré et une grande hardiesse dans la foi qui est en Jésus-Christ  **\nL'autorité du Christ dévolue à l'Église locale  **\n1 Corinthiens 5 versets 1 à 13 ; 6 versets 1 à 7 ; premier Timothée 3 verset 15 Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   L'église locale de Christ est investie de l'autorité divine pour agir en représentation de lui dans les questions d'administration parmi les croyants et la discipline de l'église. L'église locale est investie de l'autorité d'enseigner la parole de vérité au nom du Seigneur et de veiller sur la vie des membres de l'église. Les rôles de l'église comprennent le jugement entre les croyants et l'administration de la discipline aux égarés. Par conséquent, les dirigeants de l'église doivent être respectés et vénérés comme ceux qui doivent rendre compte à Dieu pour toutes les âmes de l'église locale. Les pasteurs, les anciens ou les évêques de l'église doivent être honorés pour leur travail. L'honneur doit également être rendu aux diacres et à tous ceux qui sont investis d'une autorité juste dans l'église de Dieu, qui est la maison de Dieu.  **\nMatthieu 16 verset 18   **\nEt je te dis aussi que tu es Pierre, et sur ce roc je bâtirai mon Église; et les portes de l'enfer ne prévaudront pas contre lui  **\nMatthieu 18 verset 15 à 20   **\n15 Et si ton frère a péché contre toi, va lui dire sa faute entre toi et lui seul, s'il t'écoute, tu as gagné ton frère. 16 Mais s'il ne t'écoute pas, alors prends avec toi un ou deux autres, afin que dans la bouche de deux ou trois témoins chaque parole soit établie.\n17 Et s'il néglige de les écouter, dis-le à l'Église, mais s'il néglige d'écouter l'Église, qu'il soit pour toi comme un païen et un publicain.\n18 En vérité, je vous le dis, tout ce que vous lierez sur la terre sera lié dans les cieux, et tout ce que vous délierez sur la terre sera délié dans les cieux.\n19 Je vous dis encore que si deux d'entre vous s'accordent sur la terre pour ce qu'ils demandent, cela leur sera accordé par mon Père qui est dans les cieux.\n20 Car là où deux ou trois sont assemblés en mon nom, je suis au milieu d'eux  **\nActes 20 verset 17 à 32   **\n17 Et il envoya de Milet à Éphèse, et appela les anciens de l'Église.\n18 Et lorsqu'ils furent arrivés à lui, il leur dit   Vous savez, depuis le premier jour que je suis venu en Asie, comment j'ai été avec vous en toutes saisons, 19 servant le Seigneur en toute humilité d'esprit, et avec beaucoup de larmes et de tentations, qui m'ont frappé par la mise à l'affût des Juifs \n20 Et comment je n'ai rien retenu de ce qui t'était profitable, mais ne t'ai montré, et ne t'ai enseigné publiquement, et de maison en maison,\n21 Témoignant tant aux Juifs qu'aux Grecs, la repentance envers Dieu, et la foi envers notre Seigneur Jésus Christ.\n22 Et maintenant, voici, je vais lié par l'esprit à Jérusalem, ne sachant pas ce qui m'y arrivera;\n23 Sauf que le Saint-Esprit témoigne dans chaque ville, disant que les liens et les afflictions me supportent.\n24 Mais aucune de ces choses ne m'émeut, et je ne considère pas ma vie comme chère à moi-même, afin que je puisse terminer ma course avec joie, et le ministère que j'ai reçu du Seigneur Jésus, pour témoigner l'évangile de la grâce de Dieu. .\n25 Et maintenant, voici, je sais que vous tous, au milieu desquels je suis allé prêcher le royaume de Dieu, vous ne verrez plus ma face.\n26 C'est pourquoi je vous prends pour enregistrer aujourd'hui que je suis pur du sang de tous les hommes. 27 Car je n'ai pas hésité à vous annoncer tout le conseil de Dieu.\n28 Prenez donc garde à vous-mêmes et à tout le troupeau sur lequel le Saint-Esprit vous a établis surveillants, pour paître l'Église de Dieu, qu'il a acquise de son propre sang.\n29 Car je sais ceci, qu'après mon départ, des loups cruels entreront parmi vous, n'épargnant pas le troupeau.\n30 Des hommes s'élèveront aussi de vous-mêmes, disant des choses perverses, pour entraîner des disciples après eux.\n31 C'est pourquoi veillez et souvenez-vous que pendant trois ans je n'ai cessé d'avertir chacun nuit et jour avec larmes. 32 Et maintenant, frères, je vous recommande à Dieu et à la parole de sa grâce, qui peut vous édifier et vous donner un héritage parmi tous ceux qui sont sanctifiés   **\nPremier Timothée 3 verset 15   **\nMais si je tarde longtemps, afin que tu saches comment tu dois te conduire dans la maison de Dieu, qui est l'église du Dieu vivant, la colonne et le fondement de la vérité  **\nL'Autorité des Croyants en Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Ceux qui croient au Seigneur Jésus-Christ ont été habilités par Jésus à faire ce qu'Il peut faire   guérir les malades, chasser les démons, accomplir des miracles. Ils ont reçu l'autorité d'utiliser le nom de Jésus dans la prière et la louange et pour le ministère et les miracles   **\nJean 14 verset 12 à 14  **\n12 En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, celui qui croit en moi fera aussi les oeuvres que je fais; et il fera des oeuvres plus grandes que celles-ci; car je vais à mon Père. 13 Et tout ce que vous demanderez en mon nom, je le ferai, afin que le Père soit glorifié dans le Fils.\n14 Si vous demandez quelque chose en mon nom, je le ferai  **\nActes 3 verset 1 à 16  **\n1 Or Pierre et Jean montaient ensemble dans le temple à l'heure de la prière, qui était la neuvième heure.\n2 Et on emmena un homme boiteux dès le ventre de sa mère, qu'on déposa chaque jour à la porte du temple qu'on appelle Belle, pour demander l'aumône à ceux qui entraient dans le temple ;\n3 Lequel, voyant Pierre et Jean sur le point d'entrer dans le temple, demanda l'aumône.\n4 Et Pierre, fixant ses yeux sur lui avec Jean, dit   Regarde-nous.\n5 Et il les écoutait, s'attendant à recevoir quelque chose d'eux.\n6 Alors Pierre dit   Je n'ai ni argent ni or ; mais tel que j'ai, je te le donne; Au nom de Jésus-Christ de Nazareth, lève-toi et marche.\n7 Et il le prit par la main droite, et le souleva ; et immédiatement ses pieds et ses chevilles ont reçu de la force.\n8 Et il se leva d'un bond, et marcha, et entra avec eux dans le temple, marchant, et sautant, et louant Dieu.\n9 Et tout le peuple le vit marcher et louer Dieu ;\n10 Et ils savaient que c'était lui qui était assis pour l'aumône à la belle porte du temple ; et ils furent remplis d'émerveillement et d'étonnement de ce qui lui était arrivé.\n11 Et comme le boiteux qui avait été guéri tenait Pierre et Jean, tout le peuple courut ensemble vers eux sous le portique appelé celui de Salomon, dans un grand étonnement.\n12 Et quand Pierre vit cela, il répondit au peuple   Hommes d'Israël, pourquoi vous étonnez-vous de cela ? ou pourquoi nous regardez-vous si sérieusement, comme si par notre propre puissance ou sainteté nous avions fait marcher cet homme ?\n13 Le Dieu d'Abraham, d'Isaac et de Jacob, le Dieu de nos pères, a glorifié son Fils Jésus ; que vous avez livré, et que vous avez renié devant Pilate, quand il était décidé à le laisser aller.\n14 Mais vous avez renié le Saint et le Juste, et vous avez demandé qu'un meurtrier vous soit accordé ;\n15 Et tua le prince de la vie, que Dieu a ressuscité des morts ; dont nous sommes témoins.\n16 Et son nom, par la foi en son nom, a fortifié cet homme, que vous voyez et connaissez ; oui, la foi qui est par lui lui a donné cette parfaite santé en présence de vous tous  **\nAmour fraternel et unité  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   L'amour fraternel et l'unité chrétienne ornent l'évangile de Christ et glorifient Dieu. Le monde par ces qualités reconnaît les enfants de Dieu et est attiré par l'évangile de Christ. L'amour fraternel doit être dans la sincérité et la pureté, sans hypocrisie. Les croyants sont un en Christ, quels que soient leur tribu, leur nation, leur race, leur sexe, leur rang et leur dénomination. L'amour et l'unité chrétienne doivent être pratiqués en toute sincérité et pureté. Les croyants doivent être hospitaliers et généreux. L'amour et l'unité chrétienne doivent être centrés sur la seigneurie de Jésus, l' autorité des Écritures, la justice et la sainteté bibliques, l'évangélisation et le service chrétien.   **\nJean 13 verset 34, 35   **\n34 Je vous donne un nouveau commandement   que vous vous aimiez les uns les autres ; comme je vous ai aimés, afin que vous vous aimiez aussi les uns les autres. 35 A ceci tous connaîtront que vous êtes mes disciples, si vous avez de l'amour les uns pour les autres  **\nJean 17 verset 20 à 23   **\n20 Je ne prie pas pour eux seuls, mais aussi pour ceux qui croiront en moi par leur parole;\n21 Afin que tous soient un; comme toi, Père, tu es en moi, et moi en toi, afin qu'eux aussi soient un en nous, afin que le monde croie que tu m'as envoyé.\n22 Et la gloire que tu m'as donnée, je la leur ai donnée ; qu'ils soient un, comme Nous sommes un ;\n23 moi en eux, et toi en moi, afin qu'ils soient rendus parfaits en un seul; et que le monde sache que tu m'as envoyé et que tu les as aimés comme tu m'as aimé  **\nPremier Jean 4 verset 7 à 12  **\n7 Bien-aimés, aimons-nous les uns les autres   car l'amour est de Dieu ; et quiconque aime est né de Dieu et connaît Dieu.\n8 Celui qui n'aime pas ne connaît pas Dieu; car Dieu est amour.\n9 En cela s'est manifesté l'amour de Dieu envers nous, parce que Dieu a envoyé son Fils unique dans le monde, afin que nous vivions par lui.\n10 En ceci est l'amour, non que nous ayons aimé Dieu, mais qu'il nous ait aimés et qu'il ait envoyé son Fils pour être la propitiation pour nos péchés.\n11 Bien-aimés, si Dieu nous a tant aimés, nous devons aussi nous aimer les uns les autres.\n12 Personne n'a jamais vu Dieu. Si nous nous aimons les uns les autres, Dieu habite en nous, et son amour est parfait en nous  **\nPhilippiens 2 verset 1 à 5  **\n1 S'il y a donc quelque consolation en Christ, s'il y a quelque consolation d'amour, s'il y a quelque communion de l'Esprit, s'il y a des entrailles et des miséricordes,\n2 Accomplissez-vous ma joie, que vous ayez le même esprit, ayant le même amour, étant d'un accord, d'un même esprit.\n3 Que rien ne se fasse par dispute ou par vaine gloire ; mais dans l'humilité d'esprit que chacun estime l'autre meilleur qu'eux-mêmes.\n4 Ne regardez pas chacun à ses propres affaires, mais chacun aussi aux affaires des autres. 5 Que cette pensée soit en vous, qui était aussi en Jésus-Christ  **\nGalates 1 verset 6 à 10  **\n6 Je m'étonne que vous soyez si tôt éloignés de celui qui vous a appelés à la grâce de Christ pour un autre évangile  \n7 Qui n'en est pas un autre ; mais il y en a qui vous troublent et qui veulent pervertir l'évangile de Christ.\n8 Mais si nous, ou un ange du ciel, vous prêchait un autre évangile que celui que nous vous avons prêché, qu'il soit anathème.\n9 Comme nous l'avons déjà dit, je le répète maintenant   Si quelqu'un vous annonce un autre évangile que celui que vous avez reçu, qu'il soit anathème.\n10 Car est-ce que je persuade maintenant les hommes, ou Dieu ? ou est-ce que je cherche à plaire aux hommes ? car si je plaisais encore aux hommes, je ne serais pas le serviteur de Christ  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 10  **\nOBÉISSANCE AUX COMMANDEMENTS ET INSTRUCTIONS DE DIEU  **\nBaptême d'eau Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Quiconque a entendu l'évangile de Jésus-Christ, s'est repenti de ses péchés et a accepté Jésus comme son Seigneur et Sauveur de tout son cœur aura besoin du baptême d'eau comme confirmation de sa prétention. Le baptême d'eau est une immersion dans un corps d'eau au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit. Le baptême d'eau n'est pas pour les enfants ignorants ou les personnes qui ne se sont pas encore repenties de leurs péchés.  **\nMarc 16 verset 15, 16   **\n15 Et il leur dit   Allez par tout le monde, et prêchez l'Evangile à toute créature.\n16 Celui qui croira et sera baptisé sera sauvé; mais celui qui ne croira pas sera damné  **\nMatthieu 28 verset 19  **\nAllez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit  **\nActes 8 verset 36 à 38  **\n36 Et comme ils continuaient leur chemin, ils arrivèrent à une certaine eau. Et l'eunuque dit   Voici, voici de l'eau ; qu'est-ce qui m'empêche d'être baptisé?\n37 Et Philippe dit   Si tu crois de tout ton cœur, tu peux. Et il répondit et dit   Je crois que Jésus-Christ est le Fils de Dieu.\n38 Et il ordonna au char de s'arrêter, et ils descendirent tous les deux dans l'eau, Philippe et l'eunuque ; et il l'a baptisé  **\nDévotion Chrétienne  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Étudier la parole de Dieu, entendre la parole de Dieu, méditer sur la parole de Dieu et prier sans cesse jouent un grand rôle pour faire connaître au croyant le Seigneur et ses voies, obéir au Seigneur et à sa parole, grandir dans la grâce et acquérir force spirituelle. La parole de Dieu dans la vie d'un croyant et une prière régulière fervente et répandue édifient la foi, rendent le croyant victorieux du péché, de la chair, du monde et de Satan. Par conséquent, le croyant doit étudier la parole de Dieu, méditer sur la parole de Dieu et écouter toujours la prédication de la parole de Dieu. Des matériaux chrétiens bons et inspirés comme des livres, des messages enregistrés, etc. sont d'un grand avantage à cet égard. Des moments de calme personnels réguliers avec Dieu et la dévotion familiale sont des observances importantes pour un chrétien et le foyer chrétien.  **\nMatthieu 4 verset 4 Mais il répondit et dit   Il est écrit   L'homme ne vivra pas de pain seulement, mais de toute parole qui sort de la bouche de Dieu.  **\nLuc 10 verset 38 à 42  **\n38 Or, il arriva, pendant qu'ils allaient, qu'il entra dans un certain village ; et une certaine femme nommée Marthe le reçut dans sa maison.\n39 Et elle avait une soeur appelée Marie, qui était aussi assise aux pieds de Jésus et entendit sa parole.\n40 Mais Marthe était occupée de beaucoup de service, et vint à lui, et dit   Seigneur, ne te soucies-tu pas que ma sœur me laisse seule pour servir ? dis-lui donc qu'elle m'aide.\n41 Et Jésus répondit et lui dit   Marthe, Marthe, tu es soucieuse et inquiète de beaucoup de choses ;\n42 Mais une seule chose est nécessaire   et Marie a choisi la bonne part, qui ne lui sera pas ôtée  **\nEphésiens 6 verset 10 à 18  **\n10 Enfin, mes frères, soyez forts dans le Seigneur et dans la puissance de sa force.\n11 Revêtez toute l'armure de Dieu, afin que vous puissiez résister aux ruses du diable.\n12 Car nous ne luttons pas contre la chair et le sang, mais contre les principautés, contre les puissances, contre les princes des ténèbres de ce monde, contre la méchanceté spirituelle dans les hauts lieux.\n13 C'est pourquoi, prenez toute l'armure de Dieu, afin que vous puissiez résister au mauvais jour et, après avoir tout fait, tenir bon.\n14 Tenez donc ferme, ayant pour ceinture vos reins la vérité, et portant la cuirasse de la justice;\n15 Et vos pieds ont été chaussés de la préparation de l'évangile de paix ; 16 Surtout, prenez le bouclier de la foi, avec lequel vous pourrez éteindre tous les traits enflammés des méchants.\n17 Et prenez le casque du salut et l'épée de l'Esprit, qui est la parole de Dieu ;\n18 Priant toujours avec toute prière et supplication dans l'Esprit, et veillant à cela avec toute persévérance et supplication pour tous les saints  **\nObservance régulière du Super du Seigneur  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Le Dîner du Seigneur ou la Sainte Communion doit être observé par le corps des croyants régulièrement pour se rappeler mutuellement sa mort pour le salut de l'homme jusqu'à ce qu'il vienne. La Sainte Communion doit être prise par un croyant juste et saint. Chacun doit s'examiner pour s'assurer qu'il est dans la foi, avant de manger du pain et de boire de la coupe. Prendre la Sainte Communion dans le péché attire le jugement de Dieu. Il faut respecter le corps de Jésus et le sang de Jésus représenté par le pain et le vin de la Communion.  **\nLuc 22 verset 19 à 20  **\n19 Et il prit du pain, et rendit grâces, et le rompit, et le leur donna, en disant   Ceci est mon corps qui est donné pour vous, faites ceci en mémoire de moi.\n20 De même aussi la coupe après le souper, en disant   Cette coupe est la nouvelle alliance en mon sang, qui est versé pour vous  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 23 à 34  **\n23 Car j'ai reçu du Seigneur ce que je vous ai aussi livré, que le Seigneur Jésus, la nuit même où il a été livré, a pris du pain  \n24 Et après avoir rendu grâces, il le brisa, et dit   Prenez, mangez ceci est mon corps, qui est rompu pour vous, faites cela en mémoire de moi.\n25 De la même manière aussi il prit la coupe, après avoir soupé, en disant   Cette coupe est la nouvelle alliance en mon sang ; faites ceci, toutes les fois que vous la buvez, en mémoire de moi.\n26 Car toutes les fois que vous mangez ce pain et que vous buvez cette coupe, vous annoncez la mort du Seigneur jusqu'à ce qu'il vienne.\n27 C'est pourquoi quiconque mangera ce pain et boira indignement cette coupe du Seigneur, sera coupable envers le corps et le sang du Seigneur.\n28 Mais qu'un homme s'examine, et qu'ainsi il mange de ce pain, et boive de cette coupe.\n29 Car celui qui mange et boit indignement, mange et boit sa condamnation, sans discerner le corps du Seigneur.\n30 C'est pourquoi beaucoup d'entre vous sont faibles et malades, et beaucoup dorment.\n31 Car si nous nous jugeons nous-mêmes, nous ne serions pas jugés.\n32 Mais quand nous sommes jugés, nous sommes châtiés par le Seigneur, afin que nous ne soyons pas condamnés avec le monde  **\nDon chrétien   **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Les enfants de Dieu devraient donner de leur argent et de leurs ressources matérielles afin de faire avancer le cours de Christ parmi les hommes. Tous les croyants doivent payer la dîme, qui représente dix pour cent de leurs revenus. Les dîmes doivent être payées sur les salaires et traitements, les cultures vivrières et les animaux domestiques. En dehors des dîmes, les croyants doivent donner volontairement une offrande matérielle au Seigneur. Les pauvres et les nécessiteux doivent être aidés. Les croyants doivent donner généreusement pour soutenir l'évangile de Christ et ses fidèles ministres. Les ministres de l'évangile ne doivent pas extorquer de l'argent aux gens pour la cause de Christ. Dieu aime les donateurs enthousiastes. Ils ne doivent pas non plus jouer des tours au peuple pour le vider de ses ressources matérielles. Ce sera une iniquité devant le Seigneur.  **\nMatthieu 23 verset 23  **\nMalheur à vous, scribes et pharisiens hypocrites ! car vous payez la dîme de la menthe, de l'anis et du cumin, et vous avez omis les questions les plus importantes de la loi, du jugement, de la miséricorde et de la foi   celles-ci, vous auriez dû les faire, et ne pas laisser l'autre inachevée.  **\n2 Corinthiens 9 verset 6 à 9  **\n6 Mais je dis ceci   Celui qui sème peu moissonnera peu ; et celui qui sème abondamment moissonnera aussi abondamment.\n7 Que chacun donne selon ce qu'il a en son cœur; pas à contrecoeur, ou par nécessité, car Dieu aime celui qui donne avec joie.\n8 Et Dieu est capable de faire abonder toute grâce envers vous ; afin que vous, ayant toujours toute suffisance en toutes choses, puissiez abonder en toute bonne œuvre \n9 (Comme il est écrit   Il a dispersé, il a donné aux pauvres   sa justice demeure à jamais  **\nL'importance du pardon    **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Les croyants qui ont joui du pardon de Dieu et qui en jouissent quotidiennement devraient également administrer le pardon à ceux qui les offensent, quelle que soit l'offense. Ne pas pardonner à ceux qui les offensent signifie renoncer au pardon qu'ils ont reçu de Dieu. Les maris et femmes chrétiens doivent pardonner à leur conjoint tout péché, y compris l'adultère. Par conséquent, aucun péché dans le mariage ne peut entraîner le divorce.  **\n Matthieu 18 verset 21 à 35  **\n21 Alors Pierre vint vers lui, et dit   Seigneur, combien de fois mon frère péchera-t-il contre moi, et lui pardonnerai-je ? jusqu'à sept fois?\n22 Jésus lui dit   Je ne te dis pas jusqu'à sept fois, mais jusqu'à soixante-dix fois sept fois.\n23 C'est pourquoi le royaume des cieux est semblable à un certain roi, qui tiendrait compte de ses serviteurs.\n24 Et lorsqu'il eut commencé à compter, on lui en amena un qui lui devait dix mille talents.\n25 Mais comme il n'avait pas à payer, son seigneur ordonna de le vendre, ainsi que sa femme et ses enfants, et tout ce qu'il possédait, et de payer.\n26 Le serviteur se prosterna donc et se prosterna devant lui, en disant   Seigneur, aie patience envers moi, et je te paierai tout.\n27 Alors le maître de ce serviteur fut ému de compassion, le lâcha et lui remit la dette.\n28 Mais le même serviteur sortit, et trouva un de ses compagnons de service, qui lui devait cent deniers, et il mit la main sur lui, et le prit à la gorge, en disant   Paye-moi ce que tu dois.\n29 Et son compagnon de service tomba à ses pieds, et le pria, disant   Aie patience envers moi, et je te paierai tout.\n30 Et il n'a pas voulu, mais il est allé le jeter en prison, jusqu'à ce qu'il ait payé la dette.\n31 Lorsque ses compagnons de service virent ce qui s'était passé, ils furent très attristés et vinrent raconter à leur maître tout ce qui s'était passé.\n32 Alors son maître, après l'avoir appelé, lui dit   Ô méchant serviteur, je t'ai remis toute cette dette, parce que tu m'as désiré.\n33 N'aurais-tu pas dû aussi avoir pitié de ton compagnon, comme j'ai eu pitié de toi ?\n34 Et son seigneur se mit en colère, et le livra aux bourreaux, jusqu'à ce qu'il ait payé tout ce qui lui était dû.\n35 De même mon Père céleste vous fera de même, si vous ne pardonnez pas de tout votre cœur à chacun de ses frères ses offenses  **\nEphésiens 4 verset 31, 32  **\n31 Que toute amertume, et colère, et colère, et clameur, et médisance soient éloignées de vous, avec toute malveillance ;\n32 Et soyez bons les uns envers les autres, compatissants, vous pardonnant les uns aux autres, comme Dieu vous a pardonné à cause de Christ  **\nMariage chrétien et famille   **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Le mariage est pour un homme et une femme. La polygamie est interdite par Dieu. Lorsqu'un homme qui ne s'est jamais marié auparavant se marie avec une femme qui ne s'est jamais mariée auparavant selon les termes du mariage, l'union est obligatoire pour la vie jusqu'au décès de l'un des partenaires. Le divorce et le remariage lorsque le partenaire du mariage est encore en vie dans le monde sont mauvais et entraînent la damnation de l'enfer. Lorsque le mariage est formé, il ne peut jamais être dissous par l'adultère. Ils formulent \"Sauf pour la fornication\" dans Matthieu 5 32 ne concerne que ceux qui sont encore fiancés selon la tradition juive. L'exemple pratique de cela était ce que Joseph pensait faire à Marie quand il pensait qu'elle avait commis la fornication. L'expression concerne également celui dont le partenaire de mariage avait été légalement marié ou celui qui est encore en vie. Les croyants qui veulent se marier ne doivent pas épouser des non-croyants, mais d'autres croyants. Le mariage entre homme et homme ou femme et femme est une abomination à Dieu. Le mari et la femme doivent vivre dans l'amour et élever des enfants pieux.  **\nMarc 10 verset 6 à 12  **\n6 Mais dès le début de la création, Dieu les fit homme et femme.\n7 C'est pourquoi l'homme quittera son père et sa mère, et s'attachera à sa femme;\n8 Et les deux deviendront une seule chair, de sorte qu'ils ne seront plus deux, mais une seule chair.\n9 Ce que Dieu a donc uni, que l'homme ne le sépare pas. 10 Et dans la maison ses disciples l'interrogèrent encore sur la même chose.\n11 Et il leur dit   Quiconque répudie sa femme et en épouse une autre, commet un adultère contre elle.\n12 Et si une femme répudie son mari et se marie avec un autre, elle commet un adultère.  **\nRomains 7 verset 2, 3  **\n2 Car la femme qui a un mari est liée par la loi à son mari tant qu'il vit; mais si le mari est mort, elle est déliée de la loi de son mari.\n3 Ainsi donc, si, du vivant de son mari, elle est mariée à un autre homme, elle sera appelée adultère ; mais si son mari est mort, elle est libre de cette loi ; de sorte qu'elle n'est pas adultère, bien qu'elle soit mariée à un autre homme.  **\nCommunauté chrétienne et service d'adoration    **\n1 Corinthiens 11 versets 1 à 15 ; Hébreux 10 verset 25 Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Les croyants doivent apprécier la communion d'eux-mêmes dans le but de l'adoration et pour leur édification, leur exhortation et leur réconfort. La communauté des croyants aide le croyant à grandir dans la foi et à être cohérent dans la marche chrétienne. Cependant, le croyant doit éviter la communion d'adorateurs ignorants et pécheurs où règne l'aveuglement spirituel. Le croyant est particulièrement chargé de suivre la justice, la foi, la pureté et l'amour avec ceux qui invoquent le Seigneur d'un cœur pur. Christ est le chef de l'homme et l'homme est le chef de la femme. Pendant le culte, la prière ou la prophétie, l'homme doit laisser sa tête ouverte sans aucune manière de se couvrir. C'est parce que la direction de Christ sur l'homme doit être visiblement visible lors de telles occasions. Mettre une quelconque couverture sur sa tête, c'est déshonorer le Christ. Le mot évêque au sens biblique signifie pasteur ou ancien dans l'église d'abord Timothée 3 verset 1.  **\nPar conséquent, la tradition selon laquelle un évêque peut prêcher ou prier avec une casquette sur la tête et porter des bijoux est une contradiction avec la parole de Dieu et a des implications éternelles ! De même, une femme doit se couvrir la tête pendant le culte du programme, lorsqu'elle prie ou prophétise. C'est pour montrer dans un sens physique que l'homme n'est pas à la tête pendant ces activités. Ceux qui se rebellent contre cette instruction scripturaire répondront d'eux-mêmes devant Dieu. L'Église est le pilier et le fondement de la vérité. Par conséquent, la décence, la vérité et l'ordre scripturaires doivent être observés dans l'église locale sans respect des personnes.  **\nMatthieu 18 verset 19, 20  **\n19 Je vous dis encore que si deux d'entre vous s'accordent sur la terre pour ce qu'ils demandent, cela leur sera accordé par mon Père qui est dans les cieux.\n20 Car là où deux ou trois sont assemblés en mon nom, je suis au milieu d'eux.  **\nPremier Jean 1 verset 3 à 7  **\n3 Nous vous annonçons ce que nous avons vu et entendu, afin que vous aussi soyez en communion avec nous, et vraiment notre communion est avec le Père et avec son Fils Jésus-Christ.\n4 Et nous t'écrivons ces choses, afin que ta joie soit parfaite.\n5 Voici donc le message que nous avons entendu de lui, et que nous vous annonçons, que Dieu est lumière, et qu'il n'y a en lui aucune ténèbres.\n6 Si nous disons que nous sommes en communion avec lui, et que nous marchons dans les ténèbres, nous mentons et ne faisons pas la vérité ;\n7 Mais si nous marchons dans la lumière, comme il est dans la lumière, nous sommes en communion les uns avec les autres, et le sang de Jésus-Christ, son Fils, nous purifie de tout péché.  **\nLouanges et action de grâce   **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   L'adoration, les louanges et l'action de grâces sont notre devoir envers Dieu notre créateur. Nous devons toujours nous rappeler de rendre grâce à Dieu pour toute sa miséricorde, sa gentillesse, son amour et sa bonté qu'il nous montre quotidiennement, ainsi qu'aux autres. Le pardon des péchés que nous recevons de lui par Jésus-Christ appelle la louange, l'adoration et l'action de grâces au Dieu vivant. Non seulement devons-nous manifester l'esprit de gratitude envers Dieu, mais Dieu désire que nous le manifestions les uns aux autres. Il est décourageant pour Dieu que les êtres humains qui boivent sa bonté chaque jour ne prennent pas la peine de remercier et de louer Dieu. Même nos semblables se sentent déçus lorsqu'ils ne sont pas appréciés pour leurs bonnes actions. Nous devons témoigner de la bonté de Dieu et chanter ses louanges de tout notre cœur.  **\nLuc 17 verset 11 à 19  **\n11 Et il arriva, comme il allait à Jérusalem, qu'il traversait la Samarie et la Galilée.\n12 Et comme il entrait dans un certain village, il le rencontra dix hommes qui étaient des lépreux, qui se tenaient à distance ;\n13 Et ils élevèrent la voix et dirent   Jésus, maître, aie pitié de nous.\n14 Et les voyant, il leur dit   Allez vous montrer aux sacrificateurs. Et il arriva qu'en marchant, ils furent purifiés.\n15 Et l'un d'eux, voyant qu'il était guéri, se retourna, et d'une voix forte glorifiait Dieu,\n16 Et tomba la face contre terre à ses pieds, lui rendant grâces, et c'était un Samaritain.\n17 Et Jésus, répondant, dit   N'y en a-t-il pas dix qui ont été purifiés ? mais où sont les neuf? 18 Il ne se trouve personne qui soit revenu pour rendre gloire à Dieu, sauf cet étranger.\n19 Et il lui dit   Lève-toi, va, ta foi t'a guéri.  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 19, 20  **\n19 Parlant à vous-mêmes par des psaumes, des hymnes et des chants spirituels, chantant et chantant dans votre cœur au Seigneur ;\n20 Rendez toujours grâces pour toutes choses à Dieu et le Père au nom de notre Seigneur Jésus Christ;  **\n\nCHAPITRE 11  **\nÉVÉNEMENTS DES DERNIERS JOURS  **\nCaractéristiques des derniers jours   **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Les derniers jours seront caractérisés par la multiplicité des iniquités, la haine de Dieu, les catastrophes naturelles, l'intensification des activités sataniques, la régression, les faux prophètes et les enseignants accomplissant des miracles, la négligence humaine et la moquerie pour la venue du Seigneur. Pourtant, les derniers jours seront également caractérisés par l'effusion du Saint-Esprit sur les hommes et les femmes pour un travail évangélique explosif et l'évangile du Seigneur Jésus-Christ sera prêché dans le monde entier en utilisant divers moyens et technologies scientifiques. Les prédicateurs de la vérité et de la sainteté seront toujours là pour faire leur travail jusqu'à la fin. Malgré les difficultés, la persécution féroce et les grands défis, les gens croiront toujours l'évangile et persévéreront dans la justice jusqu'à la fin.   **\nMatthieu 24 verset 1, 4 à 14  **\n1 Et comme il était assis sur la montagne des Oliviers, les disciples s'approchèrent de lui en privé, disant   Dites-nous, quand cela arrivera-t-il ? et quel sera le signe de ton avènement et de la fin du monde ?\n4 Et Jésus répondit et leur dit   Prenez garde que personne ne vous séduise.\n5 Car plusieurs viendront en mon nom, disant   Je suis le Christ ; et en séduira beaucoup.\n6 Et vous entendrez parler de guerres et de bruits de guerres ; veillez à ne pas vous troubler, car toutes ces choses doivent arriver, mais la fin n'est pas encore venue.\n7 Car nation s'élèvera contre nation, et royaume contre royaume; et il y aura des famines, des pestes et des tremblements de terre en divers lieux.\n8 Tout cela est le commencement des douleurs.\n9 Alors ils vous livreront pour être affligés, et vous feront mourir; et vous serez haïs de toutes les nations à cause de mon nom.\n10 Et alors plusieurs seront scandalisés, et se trahiront les uns les autres, et se haïront l'un\n11 Et beaucoup de faux prophètes se lèveront et séduiront\n12 Et parce que l'iniquité abondera, l'amour de beaucoup se refroidira.\n13 Mais celui qui persévérera jusqu'à la fin, celui-là sera sauvé.\n14 Et cet évangile du royaume sera prêché dans le monde entier pour servir de témoignage à toutes les nations ; et alors viendra la fin.  **\nDeuxième Pierre 3 verset 1 à 14  **\n1 Cette seconde épître, bien-aimés, je vous l'écris maintenant ; dans les deux, j'attise vos esprits purs par le souvenir  \n2 Afin que vous vous souveniez des paroles qui ont été prononcées auparavant par les saints prophètes, et du commandement qui nous est donné, nous les apôtres du Seigneur et Sauveur  \n3 Sachant premièrement ceci, qu'il viendra dans les derniers jours des moqueurs, marchant selon leurs propres convoitises,\n4 Et disant   Où est la promesse de sa venue ? car depuis que les pères se sont endormis, toutes choses continuent comme elles étaient depuis le commencement de la création.\n5 Car ils ignorent volontairement que, par la parole de Dieu, les cieux étaient autrefois, et la terre debout hors de l'eau et dans l'eau  \n6 Par quoi le monde qui était alors, étant inondé d'eau, périt  \n7 Mais les cieux et la terre, qui sont maintenant, par la même parole sont gardés en réserve, réservés au feu pour le jour du jugement et de la perdition des hommes impies.\n8 Mais, bien-aimés, n'ignorez pas cette seule chose, c'est qu'un jour est auprès du Seigneur comme mille ans, et mille ans comme un jour.\n9 Le Seigneur ne néglige pas sa promesse, comme certains pensent qu'il y a négligence ; mais il est patient envers nous, ne voulant pas qu'aucun périsse, mais que tous arrivent à la repentance.\n10 Mais le jour du Seigneur viendra comme un voleur dans la nuit ; dans lequel les cieux passeront avec un grand bruit, et les éléments fondront avec une chaleur ardente, la terre aussi et les ouvrages qui s'y trouvent seront brûlés.\n11 Puisque toutes ces choses seront dissoutes, quelle sorte de personnes devez-vous être en toute sainte conversation et piété,\n12 Attendant et se hâtant vers la venue du jour de Dieu, où les cieux étant en feu seront dissous, et les éléments fondront avec une chaleur ardente ?\n13 Néanmoins, selon sa promesse, nous attendons de nouveaux cieux et une nouvelle terre, où habite la justice.\n14 C'est pourquoi, bien-aimés, voyant que vous attendez de telles choses, appliquez-vous à être trouvés par lui en paix, sans tache et irréprochables.  **\nFaux Prophètes Et Enseignants  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Les croyants doivent se méfier des faux prophètes et des faux docteurs. Ceux-ci apparaissent extérieurement religieux et spirituels. Ils montrent beaucoup de spiritualité avec leur bouche, mais leur cœur est méchant et abominable. Ils peuvent être connus par leurs fruits. Leurs fruits incluent leur vie pécheresse, une fausse doctrine, une interprétation erronée des Écritures, des convertis chargés de péchés, des signes et des prodiges démoniaques et une rébellion pure et simple contre Dieu. Les croyants doivent se méfier d'eux, doivent vérifier, tester et mettre à l'épreuve chaque prédicateur par la parole de Dieu pour voir s'il est de Dieu ou non. Les doctrines enseignées et les miracles accomplis par eux doivent être authentifiés par l'Écriture. Cette vérification scripturaire est exigée de chaque prédicateur, surveillant général, fondateur de l'Église et même de l'enseignant de l'école du dimanche. Les âmes des hommes sont précieuses et ne devraient pas être laissées entre les mains d'hommes corrompus pour être détruites !   **\nMatthieu 7 verset 15 à 23  **\n15 Méfiez-vous des faux prophètes, qui viennent à vous en vêtements de brebis, mais au dedans ce sont des loups ravisseurs.\n16 Vous les reconnaîtrez à leurs fruits. Les hommes cueillent-ils des raisins d'épines, ou des figues de chardons ?\n17 De même tout bon arbre produit de bons fruits ; mais un arbre corrompu produit de mauvais fruits.\n18 Un bon arbre ne peut porter de mauvais fruits, ni un mauvais arbre porter de bons fruits.\n19 Tout arbre qui ne produit pas de bons fruits est coupé et jeté au feu.\n20 C'est pourquoi vous les reconnaîtrez à leurs fruits.\n21 Tous ceux qui me disent   Seigneur, Seigneur, n'entreront pas tous dans le royaume des cieux ; mais celui qui fait la volonté de mon Père qui est dans les cieux.\n22 Plusieurs me diront en ce jour-là   Seigneur, Seigneur, n'avons-nous pas prophétisé en ton nom ? et tu as chassé des démons en ton nom? et fait en ton nom beaucoup d'œuvres merveilleuses ?\n23 Et alors je leur avouerai que je ne vous ai jamais connus ; éloignez-vous de moi, vous qui commettez l'iniquité.  **\nDeuxième Pierre 2 verset 1 à 3  **\n1 Mais il y avait aussi de faux prophètes parmi le peuple, comme il y aura de faux docteurs parmi vous, qui introduiront en secret des hérésies damnables, reniant même le Seigneur qui les a rachetés, et attireront sur eux une destruction rapide. 2 Et beaucoup suivront leurs voies pernicieuses ; à cause de qui on parlera mal de la voie de la vérité.\n3 Et par convoitise ils feront de vous, avec des paroles feintes, du commerce dont le jugement maintenant de longtemps ne s'attarde pas, et leur damnation ne sommeille pas.  **\nL'enlèvement des saints Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Le Seigneur reviendra pour enlever ses saints de la terre au ciel. Il descendra du ciel avec Ses anges et les saints maintenant dans le ciel avec un cri, avec la voix de l'archiange. La trompette de Dieu sonnera. Le Seigneur restera dans les airs. Les saints qui sont venus avec lui du ciel retourneront sur la terre pour être réunis avec leur corps et ressusciteront avec un corps glorieux. Les saints vivants sur terre seront soudainement changés et transformés, avec un corps éternel glorieux. Ils se lèveront pour rencontrer le Seigneur dans les airs. Le Seigneur les ramènera tous au ciel pour le festin des noces et leur donnera des récompenses éternelles selon leurs œuvres. C'est un message de réconfort pour les croyants. L'enlèvement est la première phase de la seconde venue de Jésus-Christ.  **\nMatthieu 24 verset 36 à 42  **\n36 Mais personne ne connaît ce jour et cette heure, non, pas les anges du ciel, mais mon Père seul.\n37 Mais comme furent les jours de Noé, ainsi sera aussi l'avènement du Fils de l'homme.\n38 Car, comme aux jours qui étaient avant le déluge, ils mangeaient et buvaient, se mariaient et donnaient en mariage, jusqu'au jour où Noé entra dans l'arche,\n39 Et ne le sut pas jusqu'à ce que le déluge vint et les emporta tous ; ainsi en sera-t-il de la venue du Fils de l'homme.\n40 Alors deux seront dans les champs; l'un sera pris et l'autre laissé.\n41 Deux femmes moudront au moulin; l'un sera pris et l'autre laissé.\n42 Veillez donc, car vous ne savez pas à quelle heure votre Seigneur viendra.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 4 versets 13 à 18  **\n13 Mais je ne voudrais pas que vous soyez ignorants, frères, au sujet de ceux qui dorment, afin que vous ne vous affligiez pas, comme d'autres qui n'ont pas d'espérance.\n14 Car si nous croyons que Jésus est mort et ressuscité, de même aussi ceux qui dorment en Jésus Dieu les amènera avec lui.\n15 Car ceci, nous vous le disons par la parole du Seigneur, que nous qui sommes vivants et qui resterons jusqu'à la venue du Seigneur, nous n'empêcherons pas ceux qui dorment.\n16 Car le Seigneur lui-même descendra du ciel avec un cri, avec la voix de l'archange, et avec la trompette de Dieu ; et les morts en Christ ressusciteront premièrement ;\n17 Alors, nous qui serons vivants et qui resterons, nous serons enlevés avec eux dans les nuées, à la rencontre du Seigneur dans les airs, et ainsi serons-nous toujours avec le Seigneur.\n18 C'est pourquoi consolez-vous les uns les autres par ces paroles.  **\nLa Grande Tribulation et l'Antéchrist  **\nApocalypse 13 versets 1 à 18 ; 16 versets 1 à 18 ; Zacharie 14 verset 1 à 7 Apocalypse 19 verset 11 à 21. Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Après l'enlèvement des saints au ciel, il y aura une grande tribulation sur la terre pendant sept ans. Ce sera la période de souffrances, d'épreuves et de persécutions inégalées sur la terre. Dieu visitera la terre avec une série de jugements divins. Cette période inaugurera également l'Antéchrist qui sera un représentant physique de Satan. Il persécutera les saints qui se convertiront après l'enlèvement et persécutera la nation d'Israël. Il se déclarera Dieu et exigera l'adoration des êtres humains. Il fera prendre sa marque aux hommes de la terre 666. Celui qui la recueillera est damné à jamais. Son règne et son pouvoir prendront fin lorsque Jésus reviendra physiquement sur la terre lors de sa seconde venue à la fin de sept ans après l'enlèvement des saints au ciel. Le Seigneur vaincra l'Antéchrist et son armée à la bataille d'Armageddon. Lui et le faux prophète qui le promeut seront jetés vivants dans l'étang de feu.  **\nMatthieu 24 verset 15 à 22  **\n15 C'est pourquoi, lorsque vous verrez l'abomination de la désolation, dont parle Daniel le prophète, se tenir dans le lieu saint, (que quiconque lit, qu'il comprenne) ;\n16 Alors que ceux qui sont en Judée s'enfuient dans les montagnes  \n17 Que celui qui est sur le toit ne descende pas pour emporter quoi que ce soit de sa maison ;\n18 Que celui qui est dans les champs ne revienne pas non plus pour prendre ses vêtements.\n19 Et malheur à celles qui sont enceintes et à celles qui allaitent en ces jours-là ! 20 Mais priez pour que votre fuite ne soit pas en hiver, ni le jour du sabbat  \n21 Car alors il y aura une grande tribulation, telle qu'il n'y en a pas eu depuis le commencement du monde jusqu'à ce temps, non, et qu'il n'y en aura jamais.\n22 Et à moins que ces jours ne soient abrégés, personne ne devrait être sauvé ; mais à cause des élus, ces jours seront abrégés  **\n2 Thessaloniciens 2 verset 3 à 10  **\n3 Que personne ne vous séduise par quelque moyen que ce soit, car ce jour-là ne viendra pas, si la apostasie n'est venue d'abord, et que l'homme de péché ne soit révélé, le fils de perdition ;\n4 Qui s'oppose et s'élève au-dessus de tout ce qu'on appelle Dieu ou qu'on adore ; de sorte qu'en tant que Dieu, il est assis dans le temple de Dieu, se montrant lui-même Dieu.\n5 Ne vous souvenez-vous pas que, lorsque j'étais encore avec vous, je vous disais ces choses ?\n6 Et maintenant vous savez ce qu'il réserve pour qu'il soit révélé en son temps.\n7 Car le mystère de l'iniquité agit déjà   seul celui qui lit maintenant laissera jusqu'à ce qu'il soit retiré du chemin.\n8 Et alors apparaîtra ce méchant, que le Seigneur dévorera par l'esprit de sa bouche, et détruira par l'éclat de son avènement;\n9 Celui-là même, dont la venue est après l'action de Satan avec toute puissance, signes et prodiges mensongers,\n10 Et avec toute la tromperie de l'injustice en ceux qui périssent; parce qu'ils n'ont pas reçu l'amour de la vérité, afin d'être sauvés.    **\nLa Seconde Venue Du Christ Pour Le Règne Millénaire Jean 18 verset 33 à 37; Actes 1 verset 9 à 11 ; Esaïe 2 verset 1 à 5 ; 35 versets 1 à 10 ; Apocalypse 20 verset 1 à 10. Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Le Seigneur Jésus-Christ reviendra visiblement sur la terre comme Roi des rois et Seigneur des seigneurs, accompagné de ses anges et des saints pour gouverner ce monde pendant une période de mille années. C'est ce qu'on appelle la seconde venue du Christ. Ceux auxquels les agents de l'Antéchrist n'ont pas pu accéder avec les marques de la Bête 666 et ceux qui l'ont rejetée par tous les moyens , bien que les pécheurs remplissent à nouveau la terre pendant mille ans avec la race humaine naturelle. Le règne de mille ans sur la terre dans un sens physique est appelé le règne millénaire. Pendant ce temps, Satan sera lié et jeté dans l'abîme afin qu'il ne trompe pas les habitants de la terre. Les saints régneront avec Jésus sur le monde actuel. Le siège du monde sera Jérusalem d'où Christ régnera pendant mille ans. Cette période sera caractérisée par une paix merveilleuse, la prospérité, des bénédictions abondantes, de la joie et de l'allégresse. À la fin des mille ans, Satan sera délié de l'abîme pour retourner sur la terre. Il poursuivra son œuvre trompeuse sur les hommes de la terre. Beaucoup lui céderont. Il mobilisera les hommes naturels sur terre pour la bataille de Gog et Magag contre Christ et ses saints. Le Seigneur les détruira et mettra fin au péché et à la rébellion pour toujours et à jamais.  **\nMatthieu 24 verset 30, 31  **\n30 Et alors apparaîtra le signe du Fils de l'homme dans le ciel, et alors toutes les tribus de la terre se lamenteront, et elles verront le Fils de l'homme venir sur les nuées du ciel avec puissance et grande gloire.\n31 Et il enverra ses anges avec un grand son de trompette, et ils rassembleront ses élus des quatre vents, d'une extrémité des cieux à l'autre.  **\nApocalypse 1 verset 5 à 7  **\n5 Et de la part de Jésus-Christ, qui est le témoin fidèle, et le premier-né d'entre les morts, et le prince des rois de la terre. À celui qui nous a aimés et nous a lavés de nos péchés dans son propre sang,\n6 et a fait de nous des rois et des sacrificateurs pour Dieu et son Père ; à lui la gloire et la domination pour toujours et à jamais. Amen.\n7 Voici, il vient avec des nuées ; et tout œil le verra, et même ceux qui l'ont percé, et toutes les tribus de la terre se lamenteront à cause de lui. Même ainsi, Amen.  **\nApocalypse 20 verset 1 à 5  **\n1 Et je vis un ange descendre du ciel, ayant la clef de l'abîme et une grande chaîne à la main.\n2 Et il saisit le dragon, ce serpent ancien, qui est le diable et Satan, et le lia pour mille ans,\n3 Et jetez-le dans l'abîme, et enfermez-le, et mettez un sceau sur lui, afin qu'il ne séduise plus les nations, jusqu'à ce que les mille ans soient accomplis ; et après cela, il devra être délié un peu de temps.\n4 Et je vis des trônes, et ils s'assirent dessus, et le jugement leur fut donné, et je vis les âmes de ceux qui avaient été décapités pour le témoignage de Jésus et pour la parole de Dieu, et qui n'avaient pas adoré la bête, ni son image, ni n'avaient reçu sa marque sur leurs fronts, ou dans leurs mains; et ils vécurent et régnèrent avec Christ mille ans.\n5 Mais le reste des morts ne revint pas à la vie jusqu'à ce que les mille ans soient accomplis. C'est la première résurrection.  **\nFeu d'enfer pour les pécheurs  **\nJésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Le feu de l'Enfer est un véritable lieu de feu éternel, d'embrasement éternel et de tourment réservé aux méchants. Satan, ses démons et tous les pécheurs subiront la damnation éternelle dans le feu qui brûle de soufre et de soufre. À la fin des temps, tous les pécheurs seront ressuscités à la vie et seront jugés selon leurs œuvres lorsqu'ils étaient vivants sur terre et seront condamnés dans l'étang de feu. Le feu de l'enfer lui-même sera jeté dans l'étang de feu. Les occupants du lac de feu seront Satan, des démons ou des anges déchus et des pécheurs. Ce sera la fin de toute rébellion.  **\nMarc 9 verset 43 à 48  **\n43 Et si ta main t'offense, coupe-la, il vaut mieux pour toi entrer dans la vie mutilé, que d'avoir deux mains pour aller dans la géhenne, dans le feu qui ne s'éteindra jamais ;\n44 Où leur ver ne meurt pas, et où le feu ne s'éteint pas.\n45 Et si ton pied t'offense, coupe-le, il vaut mieux pour toi entrer par halte dans la vie, que d'avoir deux pieds pour être jeté dans la géhenne, dans le feu qui ne s'éteindra jamais ;\n46 Où leur ver ne meurt pas, et où le feu ne s'éteint pas.\n47 Et si ton œil t'offense, arrache-le, il vaut mieux pour toi entrer dans le royaume de Dieu avec un œil, que d'avoir deux yeux pour être jeté dans le feu de l'enfer ;\n48 Où leur ver ne meurt pas, et où le feu ne s'éteint pas.  **\nApocalypse 20 verset 10 à 15  **\n10 Et le diable qui les séduisait fut jeté dans l'étang de feu et de soufre, où sont la bête et le faux prophète, et il sera tourmenté jour et nuit pour toujours et à jamais.\n11 Et je vis un grand trône blanc, et celui qui était assis dessus, devant la face duquel la terre et le ciel s'enfuirent ; et il n'y a pas eu de place pour eux.\n12 Et je vis les morts, petits et grands, debout devant Dieu ; et les livres furent ouverts, et un autre livre fut ouvert, qui est le livre de vie, et les morts furent jugés d'après les choses qui étaient écrites dans les livres, selon leurs oeuvres.\n13 Et la mer rendit les morts qui s'y trouvaient; et la mort et l'enfer livrèrent les morts qui étaient en eux; et chacun fut jugé selon ses oeuvres.\n14 Et la mort et l'enfer furent jetés dans l'étang de feu. C'est le second décès.\n15 Et quiconque ne fut pas trouvé écrit dans le livre de vie fut jeté dans l'étang de feu.  **\nCiel   La Demeure des Saints  **\nEsaïe 65 verset 17 à 19 ; deuxième Pierre 3 versets 9 à 14 ; Apocalypse 21 versets 1 à 27 ; Jésus-Christ et les apôtres ont prêché que   Le ciel est la demeure de Dieu, le siège de l'univers. Il est parfait, glorieux, délicieux, confortable, saint et éternel. C'est la demeure des anges, des êtres vivants et des saints qui ont quitté la terre. Jésus l'appelle « la maison de mon Père ». Il a promis de préparer une demeure dans le ciel pour les justes. Dieu a d'autres récompenses dans le ciel pour les justes, y compris des couronnes et le privilège de s'asseoir avec lui sur son trône. Louez le Seigneur. L'esprit et l'âme de chaque vrai et saint croyant qui meurt sur terre va immédiatement au ciel pour le confort, le repos, la joie et la jubilation pour attendre la résurrection des justes morts au retour du Christ, quand ils reviendront sur la terre pour se réunir avec leur corps qui prendra une forme éternelle glorieuse ressemblant à celle de Christ. À la fin du règne millénaire, le Seigneur « créera de nouveaux cieux et une nouvelle terre ». Cela implique la rénovation de la terre et du ciel atmosphérique et le siège de l'univers sera la Nouvelle Jérusalem, qui descendra du ciel comme une épouse parée pour son mari. Ici, Dieu vivra avec les saints dans une joie et un confort éternels.   **\nJean 14 verset 1 à 3  **\n1 Que votre cœur ne se trouble pas   vous croyez en Dieu, croyez aussi en moi.\n2 Il y a plusieurs demeures dans la maison de mon Père. S'il n'en était pas ainsi, je vous l'aurais dit. Je vais préparer un emplacement pour vous.\n3 Et si je m'en vais et que je vous prépare une place, je reviendrai et je vous recevrai auprès de moi ; que là où je suis, vous y soyez aussi.  **\nHébreux 11 verset 13 à 16  **\n13 Ceux-ci moururent tous dans la foi, n'ayant pas reçu les promesses, mais les ayant vues de loin, et ayant été persuadés d'eux, et les embrassant, et confessant qu'ils étaient des étrangers et des pèlerins sur la terre.\n14 Car ceux qui disent de telles choses déclarent clairement qu'ils cherchent un pays.\n15 Et vraiment, s'ils s'étaient souvenus de ce pays d'où ils sont sortis, ils auraient peut-être eu l'occasion d'y retourner.\n16 Mais maintenant ils désirent une meilleure patrie, c'est-à-dire une patrie céleste, c'est pourquoi Dieu n'a pas honte d'être appelé leur Dieu, car il leur a préparé une ville  **\nEcclésiaste 12 verset 13, 14  **\n13 Écoutons la conclusion de toute l'affaire   craignez Dieu, et gardez ses commandements ; car c'est tout le devoir de l'homme.\n14 Car Dieu amènera toute œuvre en jugement, avec tout ce qui est caché, soit bon, soit mauvais  **\nQue Dieu bénisse votre ministère et vous estime digne de la récompense, tant sur terre qu'au ciel, Amen.\n\n",

Les chrétiens suivent maintenant le monde dans leur tradition et leurs coutumes.  **\n \nLa cérémonie d'inhumation est maintenant transformée en occasions de festin, de danse et de célébration, sans se soucier de l'âme éternelle des morts. Le Seigneur parle à travers ce livre à ses enfants pieux de ne pas suivre la tradition et la coutume du monde.    **\n \nDe nombreux enfants pieux de Dieu sont détournés de la justice et de la vie sainte lors de la cérémonie d'enterrement. Certains dépensent tous leurs gains pour honorer les morts qui peuvent être en enfer. Ils deviennent pauvres, s'endettent, donc, et deviennent offensants même envers Dieu. Soyez instruit, frère et sœur, que vous devez retourner à la cérémonie d'enterrement scripturaire pour maintenir la justice et la sainteté devant le Seigneur.  **\n \nSuivez l'enseignement, les instructions et les conseils de ce livre pour maintenir la justice et la sainteté de Dieu dans votre vie en cas de cérémonie funéraire.   **\nPasteur Paul Rika.  ** **\n \nCHAPITRE UN  **\n\nVOUS POUVEZ CONDUIRE UN ENTERREMENT SANS POLLUER VOTRE VIE CHRÉTIENNE.  **\n \nDieu veut nous enseigner sa voie et sa volonté concernant les cérémonies funéraires. Il ne veut pas que Son peuple suive la tradition et les coutumes du monde pécheur telles qu'elles sont pratiquées par de nombreuses familles, tribus, sociétés et nations. Il ne veut pas que ses enfants soient souillés lors des cérémonies funéraires. De nombreux croyants en Christ ne sont pas en mesure de maintenir leur droiture et leur sainteté en raison de compromis avec leur famille ou la société à l'occasion de l'enterrement. Que ce ne soit pas votre cas au nom de Jésus.  **\n\n\n\n1.1 Cérémonie funéraire chez les chrétiens.  **\n \nMatthieu 28 verset 18 à 20.  **\n18\tEt Jésus, s'approchant, leur parla, disant   Tout pouvoir m'a été donné dans le ciel et sur la terre.\n19\tAllez donc, et enseignez toutes les nations, les baptisant au Nom du Père, et du Fils, et du Saint-Esprit  \n20\tEnseignez-leur à observer tout ce que je vous ai commandé   et voici, je suis avec vous pour toujours, jusqu'à la fin du monde. Amen.  **\n \nIci, le Seigneur dit   ALLEZ, PRÊCHEZ et FAITES DES CONVERTIS. Quand vous aurez fait des convertis, FAITES-EN DES DISCIPLES, en LEUR ENSEIGNANT TOUTES LA PAROLE DE DIEU, tout ce que je vous ai commandé. Il a dit à ceux qui ont cru en lui   « Si vous demeurez dans ma parole, vous êtes vraiment mes disciples ; Et vous connaîtrez la vérité, et la vérité vous affranchira » (Jean 8 versets 31 à 32).  \nL'apôtre Paul a dit qu'il avait enseigné et averti chaque homme afin qu'il puisse présenter tout le monde parfait en Jésus-Christ. C'est ce que nous faisons à ceux qui sont venus à la justice de Christ.  **\n  \nColossiens 1 verset 28  **\n« Lequel nous prêchons, avertissant tout homme et enseignant tout homme en toute sagesse ; afin que nous présentions tout homme parfait en Jésus-Christ.  **\n \nLe Seigneur lève dans ces derniers jours, un corps de vrais croyants dans la justice et la sainteté. Ceux-ci doivent être enseignés la parole de Dieu à tous égards afin qu'ils puissent être parfaits devant Dieu et être prêts pour l'enlèvement. L'une des choses que le Seigneur veut que j'enseigne aux croyants en ce moment est la cérémonie d'enterrement chrétienne. Les croyants de toutes les races, tribus et communautés organisent des cérémonies funéraires de diverses manières impies à la souillure de leur vie, provoquant la colère du Dieu saint. De nombreux croyants vivant parmi leur peuple dans le monde ne sont pas conscients de la norme de Dieu sur les cérémonies funéraires. Ils suivent la tradition de la terre détruisant ainsi leur christianisme. Quand ils meurent, ils manquent le ciel parce qu'ils ont été souillés par la coutume des gens qui les entourent.  **\nEsaïe 6 verset 1 à 6  **\n1\tL'année où le roi Ozias mourut, je vis aussi l'Éternel assis sur un trône haut et élevé, et sa traîne remplissait le temple.\n2\tAu-dessus se tenaient les séraphins, chacun avait six ailes ; de deux il se couvrit le visage, et de deux il se couvrit les pieds, et de deux il vola.\n3\tEt l'un cria à l'autre, et dit  Saint, saint, saint est l'Éternel des armées  toute la terre est pleine de sa gloire.\n4\tEt les poteaux de la porte s'ébranlèrent à la voix de celui qui criait, et la maison se remplit de fumée.\n5\tAlors dis-je, Malheur à moi ! car je suis perdu; car je suis un homme aux lèvres impures, et j'habite au milieu d'un peuple aux lèvres impures, car mes yeux ont vu le roi, l'Éternel des armées.\n6\tAlors un des séraphins s'envola vers moi, tenant un charbon ardent à la main, qu'il avait pris avec les pincettes sur l'autel.  **\n \n\"J'habite parmi les gens aux lèvres impures et je suis aussi un homme aux lèvres impures.\" Mais le Seigneur veut que l'on vous enseigne la vérité afin que, bien que vous soyez dans un monde corrompu et pervers, vous deviez briller comme une lumière sans tache ni ride,   **\n \nPhilippiens 2 verset 15 et 16  **\n15\tAfin que vous soyez irréprochables et innocents, les fils de Dieu, sans reproche, au milieu d'une nation perverse et perverse, au milieu de laquelle vous brillez comme des flambeaux dans le monde ;\n16\tProclamer la parole de vie ; afin que je me réjouisse au jour de Christ, de n'avoir pas couru en vain, ni travaillé en vain.  ** \n\n\nCHAPITRE DEUX  **\nL'OCCASION D'ENTERREMENT EST UN TEMPS DE RÉFLEXION SOBRE  **\n \n2.1 Il y a un temps et une saison pour tout.  **\n \nEcclésiaste 3 verset 1,2  **\n1\tIl y a un temps pour tout et un temps pour chaque chose sous le ciel.\n2\tUn temps pour naître, et un temps pour mourir ; un temps pour planter, et un temps pour arracher ce qui est planté.  **\n \nLa mort est un phénomène courant dans le monde. Des gens de toutes sortes meurent; aussi bien les pécheurs que les saints. Cela signifie que vous ferez l'expérience de décès autour de vous, y compris ceux des membres de votre famille, des membres de l'église, des amis et d'autres personnes de votre société. Toi aussi tu mourras en ton temps. Avant que votre heure ne vienne, une raison ou une autre vous fera assister à des cérémonies funéraires.  **\n \nEcclésiaste 7 versets 2 à 5  **\n2\tIl vaut mieux aller à la maison de deuil qu'à la maison de festin ; car c'est la fin de tous les hommes; et les vivants la mettront sur son coeur.\n3\tLe chagrin vaut mieux que le rire, car la tristesse du visage rend le cœur meilleur.\n4\tLe cœur du sage est dans la maison de deuil ; mais le cœur des insensés est dans la maison de la joie.\n5\tIl vaut mieux entendre la réprimande des sages, que pour un homme d'entendre le chant des insensés.  **\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Que dit l'Écriture au sujet de la maison du deuil ?  **\n \nCette Ecriture se rapporte clairement à une cérémonie funéraire. Il définit une cérémonie funéraire et en donne la description suivante.  **\n \nI) C'est la Maison du Deuil.  **\nGenèse 37 verset 34 à 35  **\n34\tEt Jacob déchira ses vêtements, et mit un sac sur ses reins, et pleura son fils plusieurs jours.\n35\tEt tous ses fils et toutes ses filles se levèrent pour le consoler; mais il a refusé d'être consolé; et il dit  Car je descendrai dans la tombe vers mon fils en deuil. Ainsi son père le pleura.  **\n \nEcclésiaste 7 verset 4  **\n« Le cœur du sage est dans la maison de deuil ; mais le cœur des insensés est dans la maison de la joie.  **\n \nComme nous pouvons le voir, la Bible nous dit ici que le cœur du sage est dans la maison de deuil car lorsqu'il assiste à la cérémonie d'enterrement de quelqu'un qui est décédé, il est censé changer sa vie et ses folies en méditant sur le événements entourant le décès. Il est maintenant transformé en maison de fête et de joie où divers types d'aliments et de boissons sont servis lors des festins. La musique et les danses sont employées pour le plaisir du peuple. Certains servent de l'alcool et enivrent les gens. Ils mangent, boivent et dansent et oublient la tristesse divine destinée à changer leur vie par le deuil des morts.  **\n \n2 Corinthiens 7 verset 9 à 11  **\n9\tMaintenant je me réjouis, non pas que vous ayez été attristés, mais que vous vous soyez attristés jusqu'au repentir ; car vous avez été attristés d'une manière pieuse, afin que vous ne receviez aucun dommage de notre part.\n10\tCar la tristesse selon Dieu produit une repentance à salut dont on ne se repent pas, mais la tristesse du monde produit la mort.\n11\tCar voyez cette même chose, que vous vous êtes attristés après une sorte de piété, quelle attention cela a opérée en vous, oui, quelle clarification de vous-mêmes, oui, quelle indignation, oui, quelle peur, oui, quel désir véhément, oui, quel zèle, oui , quelle revanche ! En toutes choses, vous vous êtes approuvés pour être clairs à ce sujet.  **\n \nii) C'est la Maison de la Tristesse.  **\n \nLuc 24 verset 17 à 20  **\n17\tEt il leur dit, quel genre de communication avez-vous entre vous, alors que vous marchez et êtes tristes ?\n18\tEt l'un d'eux, dont le nom était Cléopas, lui répondit  N'es-tu qu'un étranger à Jérusalem, et n'as-tu pas connu les choses qui s'y sont passées en ces jours-ci?\n19\tEt Il leur dit, quelles choses? Et ils lui dirent  De Jésus de Nazareth, qui était un prophète puissant en actes et en paroles devant Dieu et devant tout le peuple;\n20\tEt comment les principaux sacrificateurs et nos chefs l'ont livré pour être condamné à mort, et l'ont crucifié.  **\n \niii) C'est la Maison de la Douleur où les gens adoptent une attitude triste et sobre.  **\nJean 11 verset 33 à 36  **\n33\tJésus donc la vit pleurer, et pleurer aussi les Juifs qui étaient venus avec elle, il gémit en esprit et fut troublé,\n34\tEt dit, où l'avez-vous mis ? Ils lui dirent   Seigneur, viens et vois.\n35\tJésus a pleuré.\n36\tAlors les Juifs dirent   Voyez comme il l'aimait !  **\n  \niv) C'est la maison de la réprimande où Dieu réprimande les gens pour leur tort et leur mal façons.  **\n \nEcclésiaste 7 verset 4 et 5  **\n4\tLe cœur du sage est dans la maison de deuil ; mais le cœur des insensés est dans la maison de la joie.\n5\tIl vaut mieux entendre la réprimande des sages, que pour un homme d'entendre le chant des insensés.\nPsaume 39 verset 11\nQuand tu corriges l'homme par des reproches pour son iniquité, tu fais que sa beauté se consume comme un papillon de nuit, assurément tout homme est vanité.  **\n \n2.3 Ce qu'un foyer en deuil n'est pas.  **\nI) Ce n'est pas la maison de festin où les gens mangent, boivent et dansent avec joie et en criant.  **\n Esther 9 verset 17 à 19  **\n17\tLe treizième jour du mois Adar; et le quatorzième jour de la même journée, ils se reposèrent et en firent un jour de fête et de joie.\n18\tMais les Juifs qui étaient à Suse s'assemblèrent le treizième et le quatorzième jour; et le quinzième jour de la même journée, ils se reposèrent et en firent un jour de fête et de joie.\n19\tC'est pourquoi les Juifs des villages, qui habitaient les villes sans murailles, firent du quatorzième jour du mois d'Adar un jour de joie et de festin, et un bon jour, et de s'envoyer des portions les uns aux autres.  **\n ii) Ce n'est pas la maison du rire où les gens font des blagues et rient pour oublier leurs chagrins et les leçons que Dieu veut qu'ils apprennent.  **\n\nJacques 4 verset 9  **\n« Soyez affligé, et pleurez, et pleurez ; que ton rire se change en deuil, et ta joie en alourdissement.  **\nvii) Ce n'est pas un lieu de vie insouciante, où les gens commettent diverses sortes de péchés et blasphèment Dieu.  **\nEsaïe 47 verset 8  **\n« C'est pourquoi écoute maintenant ceci, toi qui es adonné aux plaisirs, qui demeures négligemment, qui dis dans ton cœur   Je suis, et personne d'autre que moi ; Je ne siégerai pas comme une veuve, et je ne connaîtrai pas la perte d'enfants.  ** **\n\nCHAPITRE TROIS  **\n \nDES HOMMES PÉCHEURS ONT CORROMPU LA CÉRÉMONIE D'ENTERREMENT.  **\n \nEsaïe 1 verset 4  **\n\"Ô nation pécheresse, peuple chargé d'iniquité, semence de malfaiteurs, enfants qui sont des corrupteurs, ils ont abandonné le Seigneur, ils ont irrité le Saint d'Israël, ils sont partis en arrière.\"  **\n \nÀ partir des descriptions ci-dessus, vous pouvez voir combien de chrétiens l'ont manqué. Beaucoup ont manqué ce que Dieu ordonne à la cérémonie funéraire d'être et d'accomplir dans le cœur des hommes. Dieu dit que c'est la maison de deuil. Dieu s'attend à ce que les gens s'y rendent pour pleurer et pleurer. Aujourd'hui, la culture, la coutume, la tradition et les églises ont transformé la cérémonie d'inhumation en festin. C'est une maison où il faut entrer avec tristesse et réflexion sobre. Vous devez vous rendre à la cérémonie funéraire avec les questions   est-il arrivé au paradis ? Où est son âme maintenant ? A-t-il vécu dans la droiture et la sainteté ? S'il est mort pour ses péchés, il n'est pas avec Dieu maintenant, mais dans le feu de l'enfer.  **\n  \nHébreux 12 verset 14  **\n\"Suivez la paix avec tous les hommes et la sainteté, sans laquelle personne ne verra le Seigneur.\"  **\nPsaume 9 verset 17  **\n\"Les méchants seront changés en enfer, et toutes les nations qui oublient Dieu.\"  **\n \nUne autre chose qui devrait vous venir à l'esprit est; si je meurs maintenant, où irai-je ? Mon âme fera-t-elle le paradis ?  **\n \nPsaume 119 verset 59  **\n\"J'ai réfléchi à mes voies, et j'ai tourné les pieds vers tes témoignages.\"  **\n \nHélas, l'église a suivi le chemin du monde et a transformé la maison endeuillée en un lieu de festin, de repas, de danse et de réjouissance. Ils n'ont aucune considération qu'une âme ait quitté la terre pour l'éternité, et très probablement, pour l'éternité de l'enfer éternel. Rappelez-vous ce que dit la Bible au sujet du feu de l'enfer.  **\n \nMarc 9 verset 43 à 48  **\n43\tEt si ta main t'offense, coupe-la, il vaut mieux pour toi entrer dans la vie mutilé, que d'avoir deux mains pour aller dans l'enfer, dans le feu qui ne s'éteindra jamais  \n44\tOù leur ver ne meurt pas, et où le feu ne s'éteint pas.\n45\tEt si ton pied t'offense, coupe-le, il vaut mieux pour toi t'arrêter dans la vie, que d'avoir deux pieds pour être jeté dans la géhenne, dans le feu qui ne s'éteindra jamais. 46 Là où leur ver ne meurt pas, et le le feu n'est pas éteint.\n47\tEt si ton œil t'offense, arrache-le, il vaut mieux pour toi entrer dans le royaume de Dieu avec un œil, que d'avoir deux yeux pour être jeté dans le feu de l'enfer  \n48\tOù leur ver ne meurt pas, et où le feu ne s'éteint pas.  **\n \n3.1 Raisons de pleurer les morts .  **\nCe qui suit peut expliquer la raison pour laquelle les gens pleurent les morts  ** \n \ni)\tSes proches ne le reverront plus sur terre.  **\n \nii)\tSa contribution à la bénédiction de sa famille, de son église et de la société ne se poursuivra pas.  **\n \niii)\tBeaucoup de gens peuvent souffrir de son absence permanente.  **\n \niv)\tfemme est veuve souffrira.  **\n \nv)\tSes enfants seront orphelins de père.  **\n \nvi)\tSon bon travail dans la société ne doit pas continuer.  **\n \nvii)\tS'il est mort pécheur, il entrera dans le \tjugement éternel de Dieu en enfer.  **\n \nviii)\tS'il est mort croyant, son ministère et sa bonté parmi les croyants ont pris fin.  **\n \nix)\tIl aurait pu mourir prématurément à cause d'un incident malheureux; c'est pourquoi les gens le pleurent pour son malheur dans la vie.  **\nx)\tS'il est mort après une longue maladie ou un hasard, les gens le pleurent de pitié pour ce qu'il a souffert.  **\n \nxi)\tS'il est mort jeune, les gens pleurent parce qu'il n'a pas vécu toutes ses années et qu'il a donc peu ou rien contribué à sa famille, à l'Église et à la société humaine.  **\n \nxii)\tIl y a d'autres raisons pour lesquelles les gens pleurent les morts.  ** **\n \n\n\n\n CHAPITRE QUATRE  **\n\n4.1 Mise en garde scripturaire sur la mort du croyant  **\n \n1 Thessaloniciens 4 versets 13 et 14  **\n13\tMais je ne voudrais pas que vous soyez ignorants, frères, au sujet de ceux qui dorment, afin que vous ne soyez pas affligés, comme d'autres qui n'ont aucun espoir.\n14\tCar si nous croyons que Jésus est mort et ressuscité, de même aussi ceux qui dorment en Jésus Dieu les amènera avec lui.  **\n \nLa Bible met en garde les croyants en Christ sur leur chagrin face à la mort d'un saint. L'Écriture nous dit ce qui suit au sujet de ceux qui meurent en Christ.  **\n \nI) ceux qui meurent en Christ sont éloignés du mal à venir. Leur mort est pour leur bien.  **\n \nEsaïe 57 verset 1 et 2  **\n1\tLe juste périt, et personne ne le prend à cœur, et les hommes miséricordieux sont enlevés, personne ne considérant que le juste est enlevé du mal à venir.\n2\tIl entrera en paix ; ils reposeront dans leurs lits, chacun marchant dans sa droiture.  **\n\nEsaïe 26 verset 19  **\n« Les morts vivront, ils ressusciteront avec mon cadavre. Réveillez-vous et chantez, vous qui habitez dans la poussière, car votre rosée est comme la rosée des herbes, et la terre chassera les morts.  **\n \nii) Nous les reverrons à la résurrection s'ils sont morts dans la justice et la sainteté de Christ.  **\n \nPremier Thessaloniciens 4 versets 13 à 18  **\n13\tMais je ne voudrais pas que vous soyez ignorants, frères, au sujet de ceux qui dorment, afin que vous ne soyez pas affligés, comme d'autres qui n'ont aucun espoir.\n14\tCar si nous croyons que Jésus est mort et ressuscité, de même aussi ceux qui dorment en Jésus Dieu les amènera avec lui.\n15\tC'est pourquoi nous vous le disons par la parole du Seigneur, que nous qui sommes vivants et qui demeurons jusqu'à la venue du Seigneur, nous n'empêcherons pas ceux qui dorment.\n16\tCar le Seigneur lui-même descendra du ciel avec un cri, avec la voix de l'archange, et avec la trompette de Dieu ; et les morts en Christ ressusciteront premièrement ;\n17\tAlors nous qui sommes vivants et qui restons, nous serons enlevés avec eux dans les nuées, à la rencontre du Seigneur dans les airs ; et ainsi serons-nous toujours avec le Seigneur.\n18\tC'est pourquoi consolez-vous les uns les autres par ces paroles.  **\n \nJean 11 verset 23 à 25  **\n23\tJésus lui dit   Ton frère ressuscitera.\n24\tMarthe lui dit   Je sais qu'il ressuscitera à la résurrection au dernier jour.\n25\tJésus lui dit   Je suis la résurrection et la vie. Celui qui croit en moi, même s'il était mort, vivra   **\n \niii)\tLa mort des saints est-elle précieuse à Dieu. C'est une joie pour Dieu et les anges lorsqu'une personne meurt en Christ et arrive au ciel.  **\nPsaume 116 verset 15  **\n« Précieuse aux yeux de l'Éternel est la mort de ses saints . »  **  \n \nEsaïe 26 verset 20  **\n« Venez, mon peuple, entrez dans vos chambres, et fermez vos portes autour de vous ; cache-toi pour un petit moment, jusqu'à ce que l'indignation soit passée.  ** \n \niv)\tIls ressusciteront d'entre les morts avec un corps glorieux et éternel.  **\nMarc 12 verset 26 et 27  **\n26\tEt comme touchant les morts, qu'ils ressuscitent   n'avez-vous pas lu dans le livre de Moïse, comment dans le buisson Dieu lui a parlé, disant   Je suis le Dieu d'Abraham, et le Dieu d'Isaac, et le Dieu de Jacob ?\n27\tIl n'est pas le Dieu des morts, mais le Dieu des vivants   vous vous trompez donc beaucoup.  **\n \nJean 5 verset 25  **\n« En vérité, en vérité, je vous le dis, l'heure vient, et elle est déjà venue, où les morts entendront la voix du Fils de Dieu ; et ceux qui entendent vivront.  **  \n \n1 Corinthiens 15 verset 52  **\n\"En un instant, en un clin d'œil, à la dernière trompette, car la trompette sonnera, et les morts ressusciteront incorruptibles, et nous, nous serons changés.\"  ** \n \nPremier Timothée 2 verset 11  **\n« C'est une parole fidèle   Car si nous sommes morts avec lui, nous vivrons aussi avec lui.  ** \nApocalypse 14 verset 13  **\n« Et j'entendis du ciel une voix qui me disait   Écris   Heureux les morts qui meurent désormais dans le Seigneur, oui, dit l'Esprit, afin qu'ils se reposent de leurs travaux ; et leurs œuvres les suivent.  ** **\n\nCHAPITRE CINQ  **\nPRINCIPES DIEU PENDANT L'ENTERREMENT  **\n \n5.1 Fardeau financier pour la famille endeuillée  **\n \nPremier Jean 2 verset 15 à 17  **\n15\tN'aimez pas le monde, ni les choses qui sont dans le monde. Si un homme aime le monde, l'amour du père n'est pas en lui.\n16\tCar tout ce qui est dans le monde, la convoitise de la chair, et la convoitise des yeux, et l'orgueil de la vie, ne vient pas du père, mais du monde.\n17\tEt le monde s'en va, et sa convoitise, mais celui qui fait la volonté de Dieu demeure éternellement.  **\n  \nLa société a transformé la cérémonie d'inhumation en festin et en étalage orgueilleux de l'argent et de la richesse familiale et l'église l'a permis. Maintenant, quand quelqu'un meurt dans la famille, en plus d'être triste pour la mort, les membres de la famille pleurent également le fardeau financier impliqué dans la cérémonie d'inhumation. Beaucoup d'argent doit être amassé. La famille doit montrer sa richesse à la société. Ils veulent s'assurer que la cérémonie attire le plus de monde possible. Les membres de la famille vendent leurs propriétés, contractent des emprunts et empruntent auprès de particuliers pour le projet d'inhumation. Ce n'est pas la volonté de Dieu. Cet esprit mondain dans la cérémonie d'enterrement apporte des crises et de la haine et cause de nombreux problèmes parmi les membres de la famille. Après l'enterrement, beaucoup regrettent l'énorme somme d'argent qu'ils ont dépensée ou empruntée pour le projet d'enterrement. Beaucoup en Christ sont amenés à trébucher dans la foi à cause de ces choses parce qu'ils ne veulent pas être laissés de côté.  **\nRomains 14 verset 13  **\n« Ne nous jugeons donc plus les uns les autres, mais jugeons plutôt ceci, qu'aucun homme ne met une pierre d'achoppement ou une occasion de tomber sur le chemin de son frère. \"  **\n \n5.2 Suivez les instructions de Dieu.  **\nDieu veut que ses enfants soient formés sur le chemin de la sagesse, de la connaissance et de la compréhension afin de les faire surmonter la tradition et les coutumes des hommes, dirigées par le diable. Lorsque vous écoutez Dieu et maintenez ses voies, vous apprécierez la paix et la victoire dans votre vie.  **\n \nProverbes 4 verset 1 à 11  **\n1\tÉcoutez, mes enfants, l'instruction d'un Père, et appliquez-vous à connaître l'intelligence.\n2\tCar je vous donne une bonne doctrine, n'abandonnez pas ma loi.\n3\tCar j'étais le fils de mon père, tendre et seul aimé aux yeux de ma mère.\n4\tIl m'a aussi instruit et m'a dit   Que ton cœur retienne mes paroles ; garde mes commandements et vis.\n5\tObtenez la sagesse, obtenez la compréhension, ne l'oubliez pas; ni déclin des paroles de ma bouche.\n6\tNe l'abandonne pas, et elle te gardera, aime-la, et elle te gardera.\n7\tLa sagesse est la chose principale; acquiers donc la sagesse   et avec tout ce que tu as acquis, acquiers l'intelligence.\n8\tExalte-la, et elle te fera grandir, elle t'honorera, quand tu l'embrasseras.\n9\tElle donnera à ta tête un ornement de grâce   elle te remettra une couronne de gloire.\n10\tÉcoute, ô mon fils, et reçois mes paroles ; et les années de ta vie seront nombreuses.\n11\tJe t'ai enseigné dans la voie de la sagesse; Je t'ai conduit dans de bons chemins.  **\n \nI) Tout d'abord, il faut savoir qu'il y a du temps pour tout. Il y a un temps pour la fête et il y a un temps pour le chagrin. La cérémonie funéraire est un moment de tristesse. L'esprit de fête ne doit pas être introduit.  **\n  \nEcclésiaste 3 verset 1, 4  **\n1 Il y a un temps pour tout, et un temps pour toute chose sous les cieux  \n4 Un temps pour pleurer, et un temps pour rire ; Un temps pour pleurer, et un temps pour danser.  **\n \nii) Connaître les activités à exécuter dans votre cérémonie d'enterrement pour atteindre le but scripturaire de la cérémonie.  **\n \nEcclésiaste 7 verset 2,3  **\n2\tIl vaut mieux aller à la maison de deuil qu'à la maison de festin, car c'est la fin de tous les hommes ; et les vivants le mettront sur son coeur\n3\tLe chagrin vaut mieux que le rire, car par la tristesse du visage le cœur est rendu meilleur  **\niii)\tNe changez pas la cérémonie d'enterrement en festin en introduisant des activités de festin qui font oublier aux gens ce que Dieu a conçu la cérémonie d'enterrement.  **\niv)\tNe rivalisez pas avec les autres dans l'excellence de votre cérémonie d'enterrement. Éloignez la fierté de vous, de votre famille et du nom des morts.  **\nv)\tN'introduisez pas des choses pécheresses, des hommes pécheurs et une société pécheresse dans votre cérémonie d'enterrement.  **\nJérémie 10 verset 1, 2  **\n1\tÉcoutez la parole que l'Éternel vous dit, maison d'Israël!\n2\tAinsi dit l'Éternel  N'apprenez pas la voie des nations, et ne vous effrayez pas des signes du ciel; car les païens en sont consternés.  **\n \nvi). Ne participez pas à des funérailles familiales où les membres sont mondains et conformes au monde. Soyez ferme dans votre position, mais jouez sagement.  **\n \nMatthieu 10 verset 16  **\n« Voici, je vous envoie comme des brebis au milieu des loups ; soyez donc sages comme des serpents et inoffensifs comme des colombes.  **\nJosué 24 verset 15  **\n« Et s'il vous semble mal de servir l'Éternel, choisissez aujourd'hui qui vous voulez servir ; que ce soit les dieux que servaient vos pères qui étaient de l'autre côté du déluge, ou les dieux des Amoréens, dans le pays desquels vous habitez mais moi et ma maison, nous servirons l'Éternel . \"  **\n \nvii) N'obéissez pas aux demandes impies de votre famille ou des habitants du pays et ne craignez pas leur persécution, leurs menaces et leur sorcellerie.  **\n \nActes 4 verset 18 à 21  **\n18\tEt ils les appelèrent, et leur recommandèrent de ne rien dire ni d'enseigner au nom de Jésus.\n19\tMais Pierre et Jean répondirent et leur dirent s'il est juste aux yeux de Dieu de vous écouter plus que Dieu, jugez-vous.\n20\tCar nous ne pouvons que dire les choses que nous avons vues et entendues.\n21\tAlors, quand ils les eurent encore menacés, ils les laissèrent partir, ne trouvant rien comment ils pourraient les punir, à cause du peuple car tous les hommes glorifiaient Dieu pour ce qui était fait.  **\n \nviii) Sachez que le Seigneur votre Dieu est toujours avec vous pour vous protéger, vous délivrer, vous fortifier et vous sanctifier pour son nom.  **\nPsaume 91 verset 1 à 16  **\n1\tCelui qui demeure dans le lieu secret du Très-Haut demeurera à l'ombre du Tout-Puissant.\n2\tJe dirai de l'Éternel   Il est mon refuge et ma forteresse   mon Dieu ; en Lui j'aurai confiance.\n3\tCertes, il te délivrera du piège de l'oiseleur et de la peste nocive.\n4\tIl te couvrira de ses plumes, et sous ses ailes tu te confieras, sa vérité sera ton bouclier et ton bouclier.\n5\tTu n'auras pas peur de la terreur nocturne ; ni pour la flèche qui vole le jour;\n6\tNi pour la peste qui marche dans les ténèbres; ni pour la destruction qui ravage à midi.\n7\tMille tomberont à ton côté, et dix mille à ta droite; mais il ne s'approchera pas de toi.\n8\tC'est seulement de tes yeux que tu contempleras et verras la récompense des méchants.\n9\tParce que tu as fait de l'Éternel, qui est mon refuge, le Très-Haut, ton habitation;\n10\tAucun mal ne t'arrivera, et aucun fléau n'approchera de ta demeure.\n11\tCar il chargera ses anges de te garder dans toutes tes voies.\n12\tIls te porteront sur leurs mains, de peur que tu ne heurtes ton pied contre une pierre.\n13\tTu fouleras le lion et la vipère ; tu fouleras aux pieds le jeune lion et le dragon.\n14\tParce qu'il a mis son amour sur moi, je le délivrerai donc, je le placerai en haut, parce qu'il a connu mon nom.\n15\tIl m'invoquera, et je lui répondrai, je serai avec lui dans la détresse ; Je le délivrerai et l'honorerai.\n16\tAvec une longue vie je le satisferai, et je lui montrerai mon salut.  **\n \n5.3 Pleurez avec ceux qui pleurent.  **\n \nJérémie 31 verset 15  **\n«Ainsi, dit l'Éternel; Une voix se fit entendre à Rama, des lamentations et des pleurs amers ; Rachel pleurant ses enfants a refusé d'être consolée pour ses enfants, parce qu'ils ne l'étaient pas.  **\n \nRomain 12 verset 15  **\n\"Réjouissez-vous avec ceux qui se réjouissent, et pleurez avec ceux qui pleurent.\"  **\nExerçons cet esprit chrétien. Il y a un temps de deuil et il y a un temps de réjouissance. Dans le contexte ci-dessus, Rachael avait perdu ses deux enfants de mort subite. Le christianisme vous demande de vous joindre à votre sœur pour pleurer la mort de ses enfants. Les croyants devraient apprendre à se joindre à leurs frères pour pleurer la mort de leurs proches. Jésus est venu à la maison endeuillée de Marthe et Marie pour pleurer avec eux et les réconforter.  **\n \nJean 11 verset 32, 33  **\n32\tAlors, quand Marie fut venue où était Jésus, et qu'elle le vit, elle se prosterna à ses pieds, lui disant   Seigneur, si tu avais été ici, mon frère ne serait pas mort.\n33\tLorsque Jésus la vit pleurer, et pleurer aussi les Juifs qui l'accompagnaient, il soupira en esprit et fut troublé.  **\nBeaucoup ne s'en soucient pas. Ils ne prennent pas la peine de dire un mot de réconfort à une personne endeuillée. Ils ne prennent pas la peine d'envoyer un SMS à quelqu'un qui a perdu une relation. Ils ne prennent pas la peine de visiter les endeuillés pour les réconforter. Le frère ou la sœur dit dans son cœur   « c'est le moment où mes frères viendront me consoler ». Hélas, personne n'est venu ! Les croyants qui sont proches des frères endeuillés mais qui ne prennent pas la peine de leur rendre visite ou de leur dire un mot d'amour et de réconfort se trompent. Apprenez à sympathiser et à comprendre le chagrin de vos frères, quelle situation de la vie les a rendus tristes. Même Jésus a assisté à une maison endeuillée pour réconforter ceux qui étaient en deuil. Que les hommes et les femmes dirigeants apprennent à exprimer cet amour et cette attention aux membres et dirigeants d'église qui traversent le chagrin à cause des aléas de la vie.  **\nLamentation 1 verset 12, 13  **\n12\tN'est-ce rien pour vous, vous tous qui passez ? Voici, et voyez s'il y a une douleur semblable à ma douleur, qui m'a été infligée, par laquelle l'Éternel m'a affligé au jour de son ardente colère.\n13\tD'en haut, il a envoyé le feu dans mes os, et il prévaut contre eux; Il a tendu un filet à mes pieds, Il m'a fait reculer, Il m'a rendu désolé et défaillir tout le jour.  **\n \n5.4 Il vaut mieux donner aux personnes en deuil que recevoir d'elles.  **\n \nActes 20 verset 35  **\n« Je vous ai montré toutes choses, comment vous devez tant travailler pour soutenir les faibles, et vous souvenir des paroles du Seigneur Jésus, comment il a dit   Il y a plus de bonheur à donner qu'à recevoir.\n \nQue ceux qui viennent au foyer endeuillé pour le réconforter répondent aux questions suivantes, après avoir compris l'état et la condition du bien endeuillé.  **\na)\tEst-ce la maison endeuillée qui devrait fournir de la nourriture à tous ceux qui viennent leur rendre visite ou ceux qui viennent à eux qui devraient venir avec de la nourriture et de l'argent pour les soutenir ?  **\n\n\n \nJob 42 verset 11  **\n« Alors vinrent vers lui tous ses frères, et toutes ses sœurs, et tous ceux qui avaient été de sa connaissance auparavant, et mangèrent du pain avec lui dans sa maison ; et ils se lamentèrent sur lui, et le consolèrent de tout le mal que le Seigneur avait fait venir sur lui   chacun lui donna aussi une pièce d'argent et chacun une boucle d'oreille en or .\nRemarque   que la boucle d'oreille en or qui lui a été donnée n'était pas pour son usage mais pour son trésor. L'or est malléable et cela pourrait être façonné dans d'autres articles pour des utilisations propres.  **\n \nb)\tEst-il convenable d'aller à la maison du deuil pour recueillir des cadeaux de divers objets comme s'ils organisaient une fête pour une célébration joyeuse ?  **\nL'Écriture ci-dessous montre que donner des cadeaux aux autres marque ou caractérise des célébrations de joie et non de chagrin.  ** \nNéhémie 8 verset 9 à 12  **\n9\tEt Néhémie, qui est le Tirshatha, et Esdras, le sacrificateur, le scribe, et les Lévites qui enseignaient le peuple, dirent à tout le peuple   Ce jour est consacré à l'Éternel, votre Dieu ; ne te lamente pas, ne pleure pas. Car tout le peuple pleura en entendant les paroles de la loi.\n10\tAlors il leur dit   Allez, mangez les graisses et buvez les sucrés, et envoyez des portions à ceux pour qui rien n'est préparé car ce jour est saint pour notre Seigneur, ne soyez pas désolés ; car la joie de l'Éternel est votre force.\n11\tAlors les Lévites immobilisèrent tout le peuple, en disant   Taisez-vous, car le jour est saint ; ne soyez pas affligés.\n12\tEt tout le peuple s'en alla pour manger et pour boire, et pour envoyer des portions, et pour faire une grande gaieté, parce qu'ils avaient compris les paroles qui leur avaient été annoncées.  **\nLe partage des cadeaux se fait pendant la période de joie et non pendant le deuil. Par conséquent, la distribution de vêtements, d'assiettes et d'autres articles n'est pas nécessaire lors de la cérémonie d'inhumation. Des choses comme celles-ci sont des excès qu'il faut éviter dans les cérémonies funéraires chrétiennes afin de ne pas se conformer au monde.  ** \n \n5.5 La famille endeuillée peut partager des documents bibliques et chrétiens.  **  \nc) La famille endeuillée peut-elle partager un exemplaire de la Bible et des documents chrétiens avec ceux qui viennent les réconforter ? Oui, parce que la Bible ou de bons matériaux chrétiens peuvent produire la conversion à Christ chez ceux qui les reçoivent et les utilisent. C'est la meilleure chose à la cérémonie d'enterrement chrétienne.  **\nDeuxième Timothée 4 verset 1 à 4  **\n1\tJe te charge donc devant Dieu et devant le Seigneur Jésus-Christ, qui jugera les vivants et les morts lors de son apparition et de son royaume ;\n2\tPrêchez la parole; être instantané en saison, hors saison ; reprendre, réprimander, exhorter avec toute patience et doctrine.\n3\tCar le temps viendra où ils ne supporteront pas la saine doctrine ; mais après leurs propres convoitises ils s'entasseront des maîtres, ayant les oreilles qui démangent;\n4\tEt ils détourneront leurs oreilles de la vérité, et se tourneront vers les fables. **  **\nCHAPITRE SIX  **\nEMPATHISE AVEC LES FAMILLES EN Deuil  **\n \n6.1 Visite de Jésus à une famille endeuillée.  **\n \nJean 11 verset 14, 17  **\n14 Alors Jésus leur dit clairement   Lazare est mort.\n17 Alors, quand Jésus vint, il trouva qu'il était déjà couché dans la tombe depuis quatre jours.  **\nMarthe, Marie et Lazare étaient des disciples de Jésus. Lorsque Lazare est mort, Jésus a rendu visite à la famille pour les réconforter. Ses paroles, son affichage émotionnel et ses actions leur ont procuré un profond réconfort. Les dirigeants chrétiens doivent apprendre cela de Jésus. Efforcez-vous de donner un réconfort personnel et pratique aux frères endeuillés.  **\nJean 11 verset 32, 33  **\n32\tAlors, quand Marie fut venue où était Jésus, et qu'elle le vit, elle se prosterna à ses pieds, lui disant   Seigneur, si tu avais été ici, mon frère ne serait pas mort.\n33\tLorsque Jésus la vit pleurer, et pleurer aussi les Juifs qui l'accompagnaient, il soupira en esprit et fut troublé.  **\n \nQui est plus juste que Jésus ? Qui est plus savant que Jésus ? Mais ici, nous voyons Jésus exprimer la douleur et le chagrin du cœur. Il n'est pas venu pour annoncer ses références en tant qu'homme de foi qui a l'autorité de ressusciter les morts. Il n'est pas venu à eux avec un air de grandeur pour attirer l'attention sur lui. Il est venu pour sympathiser avec les frères endeuillés. Il est venu là pour pleurer avec ceux qui pleurent. Il en est venu à s'identifier à eux dans leur douleur et leur chagrin.  **\n \nJean 11 verset 36 à 38  **\n36\tAlors les Juifs dirent   Voyez comme il l'aimait !\n37\tEt quelques-uns d'entre eux disaient   Cet homme, qui a ouvert les yeux des aveugles, n'aurait-il pas pu empêcher que cet homme-là ne meure ?\n38\tJésus donc, gémissant de nouveau en lui-même, vient au tombeau. C'était une grotte, et une pierre était posée dessus.  **\n \n6.2 Jésus a pleuré (Jean 11 verset 35).  **\nJésus a pleuré à haute voix et les gens l'ont entendu. Des larmes coulent de Ses yeux. Les Juifs, les incroyants, ont vu la pleine identification de Jésus avec les frères endeuillés. Voyez ce qu'ils ont dit   voyez comme il l'aimait !\nL'amour n'est pas seulement en paroles, mais en action et en sincérité.  **\n  \nPremier Jean 3 verset 18 « Mes petits enfants, n'aimons pas en paroles, ni en langue ; mais en acte et en vérité ».\nCe que Jésus a fait exigera de l'humilité dans nos vies. Ainsi, il est bon d'assister à une cérémonie d'enterrement d'êtres chers et de frères chrétiens. Rendre visite à une famille endeuillée est une chose louable. Il nous offre l'opportunité de réconforter les affligés en pleurant et en pleurant avec eux. Dans la mesure du possible, soyons personnels et pratiques dans le confort de nos frères. Il y a des moments où les circonstances ne nécessitent pas notre présence personnelle. Nous devrions essayer de déléguer à d'autres de le faire pour nous.  **\nPhilippiens 2 verset 19  **\n\" Mais je compte sur le Seigneur Jésus pour vous envoyer bientôt Timothée, afin que moi aussi je sois d'une bonne consolation, quand je connaîtrai votre état.\"\nNon seulement devrions-nous visiter la maison endeuillée pour présenter nos condoléances, nous devrions être là dans le bon esprit, pour méditer sur notre vie, sur le moment de notre mort et sur la vie éternelle ou la damnation éternelle devant tous les hommes.  **\n \nEcclésiaste 7 verset 2  **\n« Il vaut mieux aller dans la maison de deuil que d'aller dans la maison de festin, car c'est la fin de tous les hommes ; et les vivants la mettront sur son cœur.\n \n6.3 Le cœur de deuil est requis lors de la cérémonie d'inhumation.  **\n  \nL'Écriture montre clairement que la cérémonie funéraire est un temps de deuil. Prenons quelques exemples  **\n \nGenèse 50 verset 10, 11  **\n10\tEt ils vinrent à l'aire d'Atad, qui est au delà du Jourdain, et là ils pleurèrent avec une grande et très douloureuse lamentation; et il fit le deuil de son père pendant sept jours.\n11\tEt quand les habitants du pays, les Cananéens, virent le deuil dans le sol d'Atad, ils dirent   C'est un deuil douloureux pour les Égyptiens ; c'est pourquoi on l'appela du nom d'Abelmizraïm, qui est au-delà du Jourdain.  **\nDeutéronome 43 verset 8  **\n\"Et les enfants d'Israël pleurèrent Moïse dans les plaines de Moab trente jours, ainsi les jours de pleurs et de deuil pour Moïse furent terminés.\"\nCependant, l'Écriture exhorte à ce que le deuil d'un saint soit contrôlé, car nous le reverrons à la résurrection.  **\nPREMIER Thessaloniciens 4 verset 13, 14  **\n13\tMais je ne voudrais pas que vous soyez ignorants, frères, au sujet de ceux qui dorment, afin que vous ne soyez pas affligés, comme d'autres qui n'ont aucun espoir.\n14\tCar si nous croyons que Jésus est mort et ressuscité, de même aussi ceux qui dorment en Jésus Dieu les amènera avec lui.  **\n \nC'est la raison pour laquelle vous devez travailler au salut de ceux que vous aimez afin qu'à leur mort, vous puissiez vous affliger d'espérance. Vous aussi, travaillez pour servir le Seigneur Jésus dans la justice et la sainteté afin que, lorsque vous mourrez, vos proches soient réconfortés dans l'espérance.\nMaintenant, la question est, si le chagrin et la tristesse peuvent être exprimés lors de la mort et de la cérémonie des croyants, une cérémonie funéraire d'un pécheur dont l'âme est en enfer peut-elle être célébrée avec des danses et de la joie et en offrant des cadeaux aux invités ?  **\n  \nLuc 16 verset 22 à 24, 27, 28  **\n22\tEt il arriva que le mendiant mourut, et fut porté par les anges dans le sein d'Abraham. l'homme riche mourut aussi et fut enterré;\n23\tEt dans l'enfer, il lève les yeux, étant dans les tourments, et voit Abraham de loin, et Lazare dans son sein.\n24\tEt il cria et dit  Père Abraham, aie pitié de moi, et envoie Lazare, afin qu'il trempe le bout de son doigt dans l'eau, et me rafraîchisse la langue; car je suis tourmenté dans cette flamme.\n27\tAlors il dit   Je te prie donc, père, de l'envoyer dans la maison de mon père ;\n28\tCar j'ai cinq frères; afin qu'il leur rende témoignage, de peur qu'eux aussi n'entrent dans ce lieu de tourments.  **\nÉzéchiel 33 verset 11  **\n« Dis-leur   Aussi vivant que je vis, dit le Seigneur, l'Éternel, je ne prends aucun plaisir à la mort des méchants ; mais que le méchant se détourne de sa voie et vive; détournez-vous, détournez-vous de vos mauvaises voies; car pourquoi mourrez-vous, maison d'Israël? \"  **\nMarc 9 verset 43, 44  **\n43\tEt si ta main t'offense, coupe-la , il vaut mieux pour toi entrer dans la vie mutilé, que d'avoir deux mains pour aller dans l'enfer, dans le feu qui ne s'éteindra jamais ;\n44\tOù leur ver ne meurt pas, et où le feu ne s'éteint pas.  **\n \nDieu est-il satisfait de cette joyeuse célébration ?  **\nPaul a dit qu'Epaphrodite était malade à mort, mais Dieu l'a guéri et a montré à Paul sa miséricorde pour cela; autrement, il aurait eu chagrin sur chagrin.  **\n \nPhilippiens 2 verset 25 à 25  **\n25\tPourtant j'ai pensé qu'il était nécessaire de vous envoyer Epaphrodite, mon frère, mon compagnon de travail et mon compagnon d'armes, mais votre messager, et celui qui a pourvu à mes besoins.\n26\tCar il désirait après vous tous, et était plein de tristesse, parce que vous aviez appris qu'il était malade.\n27\tCar en effet, il était malade près de la mort; mais Dieu a eu pitié de lui; et non seulement sur lui, mais sur moi aussi, de peur que je n'aie tristesse sur tristesse.  **\n \nMaintenant, si nous pouvons avoir de la peine pour un croyant ou un vrai homme de Dieu qui meurt et le pleurer comme Jésus a pleuré sur le juste Lazare, pouvons-nous convenir que la mort d'un pécheur dont l'âme est dans le feu de l'enfer et traverse les tourments de l'enfer devrait être célébré avec des danses, de la joie et en offrant des cadeaux et des souvenirs aux gens, ou en tuant des vaches, des chèvres et des poulets ; manger et boire avec plaisir ? Si la personne est votre parent, allez-vous faire la fête et employer des comédiens pour faire des blagues pour faire rire les gens ? Cela ne sera-t-il pas une grande moquerie pour les morts ? Jésus se lamente sur une âme qu'il a perdue en enfer, vous célébrez sa vie. Pouvez-vous être irréprochable devant Dieu pour avoir fait cela ? Ceux qui font un deuxième et un troisième enterrement pour célébrer les morts sont des pécheurs et des adorateurs d'idoles qui ignorent ce qu'ils font. Ne les rejoignez pas et ne cotisez pas pour cela.  **\n \nProverbes 24 verset 17, 18  **\n17\tNe te réjouis pas quand ton ennemi tombe, et que ton cœur ne se réjouisse pas quand il trébuche ;\n18\tDe peur que l'Éternel ne le voie, et que cela ne lui déplaise, et qu'il ne détourne de lui sa colère.  **\n \nJob 31 verset 28, 29  **\n28\tC'était aussi une iniquité à punir par le juge; car j'aurais renié le Dieu d'en haut.\n29\tSi je me réjouissais de la destruction de celui qui me haïssait, ou si je m'élevais quand le mal l'a trouvé.  **\n1 Corinthiens 13 verset 6\n\"Ne se réjouit pas dans l'iniquité, mais se réjouit dans la vérité.\"  **\n \n6.4 Que font les pécheurs dans leur ignorance ?  **\nEphésiens 2 verset 17, 18  **\n17\tEt vint prêcher la paix à vous qui étiez loin, et à ceux qui étaient proches.\n18\tCar par lui, nous avons tous deux accès par un seul Esprit au Père.  **\nLorsqu'une personne meurt, les pécheurs y voient une occasion de se rassembler pour célébrer la mort par un festin. Ils font venir des musiciens pour chanter pour eux. Ils célèbrent les morts avec des danses et des plaisirs. Ils portent des tenues uniformes avec une photo imprimée du défunt, qui souffre en enfer. Ils ne le pleurent pas mais se réjouissent d'une âme souffrante. Ils ignorent l'état éternel d'une âme non sauvée. Ils diront souvent entre eux   « Que son âme repose en paix. Ils ne savent pas qu'il n'y a pas de paix pour le pécheur. Ils ne sont pas conscients de la damnation éternelle d'une âme morte sans Jésus ! Sans sa justice !\nLes chrétiens radicaux que le Seigneur suscite dans notre génération en cette fin des temps diront non à la pollution lors des cérémonies funéraires. Prenez la position de l'Écriture dans la cérémonie d'enterrement de vos proches ou de n'importe qui. Ne suivez pas les gens du monde dans leurs actes pécheurs et ignorants. N'allez pas chercher des cadeaux ou rapporter des souvenirs d'une cérémonie funéraire, sauf ce qui fera la promotion du nom du Seigneur Jésus. Pourquoi devriez-vous collecter des cadeaux après la mort d'ivrognes, de fornicateurs, de voleurs, de sorcières et de sorciers ? Certains pécheurs dans leur fierté se vantent d'enterrer leurs morts avec une vache vivante, une voiture ou des bijoux coûteux. Certains se vantent du prix du cercueil plaqué or où ils ont enterré leurs morts. Ne suivez plus cet esprit mondain d'enterrement. Si vous l'avez fait auparavant, repentez-vous-en maintenant. Si le port de vêtements uniformes est dans le simple esprit d'identifier les membres de la famille ou pour toute raison acceptable, tout va bien. Ne cédez pas à la fierté familiale de l'affichage de la richesse et de la grandeur. Abstenez-vous de tous les actes de mal.  **\n \nPremier  Thessaloniciens 5 verset 22.  **\n« Abstenez-vous de toute apparence de mal.  **\n \nActes 17 verset 30  **\n« Et les temps de cette ignorance auxquels Dieu a fait un clin d'œil ; mais maintenant commande à tous les hommes partout de se repentir.  **\nPremier Pierre 1 verset 14 à 16  **\n14\tComme des enfants obéissants, ne vous façonnant pas selon les anciennes convoitises dans votre ignorance  \n15\tMais comme celui qui vous a appelés est saint, soyez donc saints dans toutes sortes de conversations ;\n16\tParce qu'il est écrit   Soyez saints ; car je suis saint.  **\n \n\nCHAPITRE SEPT  **\nÉTUDE DE CAS DE LA MORT ET DE L'ENTERREMENT D'UN CROYANT DANS L'ÉCRITURE  **\n \nJean 11 verset 1 à 3, 14, 19 à 27, 32, 40, 43 à 45  **\n1\tOr un certain homme était malade, nommé Lazare, de Béthanie, la ville de Marie et de sa soeur Marthe.\n2\t(C'était cette Marie qui a oint le Seigneur d'un parfum et qui lui a essuyé les pieds avec ses cheveux, dont le frère Lazare était malade.)\n3\tC'est pourquoi ses soeurs envoyèrent vers lui, disant  Seigneur, voici, celui que tu aimes est malade.\n11 Il dit ces choses; et après cela il leur dit   Notre ami Lazare dort ; mais je m'en vais, afin de le réveiller de son sommeil.\n12 Alors ses disciples dirent   Seigneur, s'il dort, il fera bien.\n13\tCependant Jésus a parlé de sa mort   mais ils pensaient qu'il avait parlé de prendre du repos dans le sommeil.\n14\tAlors Jésus leur dit clairement   Lazare est mort.\n15\tEt je suis heureux à cause de vous que je n'étais pas là, dans l'intention que vous puissiez croire ; allons néanmoins à lui.\n19\tEt beaucoup de Juifs vinrent vers Marthe et Marie, pour les consoler au sujet de leur frère.\n20\tAlors Marthe, dès qu'elle apprit que Jésus venait, alla à sa rencontre, mais Marie resta assise dans la maison.\n21\tAlors Marthe dit à Jésus   Seigneur, si tu avais été ici, mon frère ne serait pas mort.\n22\tMais je sais que même maintenant, tout ce que tu demanderas à Dieu, Dieu te le donnera.\n23\tJésus lui dit   ton frère ressuscitera.\n24\tMarthe lui dit   Je sais qu'il ressuscitera à la résurrection au dernier jour.\n25\tJésus lui dit   Je suis la résurrection et la vie ; celui qui croit en moi, même s'il était mort, vivra;\n26\tEt quiconque vit et croit en moi ne mourra jamais. Croyez-vous cela?\n27\t Elle lui dit   Oui, Seigneur ; Je crois que tu es le Christ, le Fils de Dieu, qui doit venir dans le monde.\n32 Alors, quand Marie fut venue où était Jésus, et qu'elle le vit, elle se prosterna à ses pieds, lui disant   Seigneur, si tu avais été ici, mon frère ne serait pas mort.\n40 Jésus lui dit   Ne t'ai-je pas dit que, si tu croyais, tu verrais la gloire de Dieu ?\n43\tEt ayant ainsi parlé, il cria d'une voix forte   Lazare, sors.\n44\tEt celui qui était mort sortit, pieds et poings liés avec des nappes funéraires, et son visage était enveloppé d'un suaire. Jésus leur dit   Déliez-le, et laissez-le aller.\n45\tAlors beaucoup de Juifs qui vinrent à Marie, et qui avaient vu les choses que Jésus avait faites, crurent en lui.  **\n \nCÉRÉMONIE D'ENTERREMENT SIMPLE DANS L'ÉCRITURE.  ** \n \nRomains 15 verset 4  **\n« Qui ont pour ma vie donné leur propre cou ; à qui non seulement je rends grâces, mais aussi à toutes les Églises des Gentils.\nVoici un exemple biblique de la cérémonie d'enterrement d'un croyant. Voir la façon dont le croyant conduit la cérémonie d'enterrement d'un parent. Si c'est peut-être votre enfant ou votre femme qui est décédé(e) et que vous êtes en mesure d'exercer un pouvoir sur l'enterrement, faites-en un enterrement chrétien.  **\n \n7.1 Voir la cérémonie d'enterrement simple pour Lazare.  **\n \nLorsque Lazare est mort, les parents, amis, voisins et proches ont été informés autant que la famille endeuillée pouvait contacter. La direction de l'église a obtenu l'information, donc Jésus aussi a été informé. Lazarus, Mather et Mary vivaient dans leur maison familiale. Lazare a été enterré dans la maison familiale. Il est courant dans chaque communauté qu'un lieu d'inhumation général soit prévu pour ceux qui n'ont pas d'endroit approprié pour enterrer leurs morts. Un tel endroit peut être utilisé pour enterrer tout croyant qui meurt.\nIl faut éviter la tradition de convoyer le mort à sa famille qui peut être trop éloignée, qu'il faut dépenser des sommes colossales pour le transport. L'évangile de Jésus et les parents vivants ont besoin de plus d'argent que les morts. Le lieu et le coût de l'inhumation n'affectent pas l'état éternel du mort. C'est une bonne pratique observée par les pécheurs, combien plus les croyants.\nBeaucoup sont venus dans la famille pour assister à l'enterrement et réconforter les personnes endeuillées.  **\nJean 11 verset 19  **\n\"Et beaucoup de Juifs vinrent vers Marthe et Marie, pour les consoler au sujet de leur frère.\"\nSont-ils venus manger et boire ? Que sont-ils venus faire ? Ils sont venus réconforter la famille endeuillée. Après la cérémonie d'inhumation, sont-ils rentrés chez eux avec des souvenirs ? Le voisin sincère les soutiendra plutôt avec de l'argent ou des denrées alimentaires pour les aider à nourrir ceux qui sont venus les réconforter, qui peuvent être amenés à rester plus longtemps. Ceci est fait pour soulager la famille endeuillée d'un fardeau supplémentaire.  **\n 7.2 Enterrement immédiat du cadavre.  **\nJean 11 verset 6  **\n\"Quand il apprit donc qu'il était malade, il demeura deux jours encore au même endroit où il était.\"\nIl apparaît que lorsque Jésus apprit que Lazare était malade, ce même jour il mourut. Pendant ce temps, Jésus est resté là où il était encore deux jours. Cela signifie qu'il a continué son voyage de retour en Judée le troisième jour et est arrivé le quatrième jour. Nous pouvons en déduire que Lazare a été enterré le jour même de sa mort.  **\nJean 11 verset 39  **\n« Jésus a dit   Otez la pierre. Marthe, la soeur de celui qui était mort, lui dit  Seigneur, à ce moment-là il pue; car il est mort depuis quatre jours.  **\nPourquoi n'ont-ils pas laissé le corps de Lazare non enterré en attendant que Jésus vienne le voir avant de l'enterrer ? Ce que vous voyez aujourd'hui, c'est que lorsqu'un homme meurt, on ne l'enterrera pas avant que son fils en Angleterre ou sa fille en Amérique ou l'autre en Russie ou au Cameroun ne rentre à la maison. Pourquoi pratiquez-vous l'inhumation différée pour tenir les gens en haleine ? Ceci est fait sans aucun doute pour avoir assez de temps pour rassembler de l'argent et inviter une multitude de personnes pour l'étalage familial de la richesse pour la renommée Soyez informé que les croyants au temps du Christ et dans l'église primitive ne pratiquaient pas cela. Ils ont enterré leurs morts immédiatement comme nous pouvons le voir dans le cas de Lazare.  **\n \nLe croyant est un intendant de l'argent et des ressources matérielles de Dieu. Il ne doit pas le gaspiller sur ce qui a une valeur inférieure à la diffusion de l'évangile du Christ, le Seigneur le tiendra coupable d'avoir gaspillé ses ressources sur des coûts inutiles équivalant à un gaspillage.  **\nLuc 9 verset 60  **\n\"Jésus l'aide à laisser les morts enterrer leurs morts  mais allez mille prêcher le royaume de Dieu\"  **\n\n\n \nUN AVOCAT APPROPRIÉ EST REQUISE POUR TOUT CAS EXCEPTIONNEL.  **\n \nProverbes 10 verset 14  **\n« Les sages accumulent des connaissances, mais la bouche des insensés est proche de la destruction »  **\nENCORE, CONSIDÉRONS LE CAS DE TABITHA (DORCAS)  **\nActes 9 verset 36 à 43  **\n36\tOr il y avait à Joppé une certaine disciple nommée Tabitha, qui par interprétation s'appelle Dorcas, cette femme était pleine de bonnes œuvres et d'aumônes qu'elle faisait.\n37\tEt il arriva, en ces jours-là, qu'elle tomba malade, et mourut, qu'après avoir lavée, ils la déposèrent dans une chambre haute.\n38\tEt comme Lydda était près de Joppé, et que les disciples avaient appris que Pierre s'y trouvait, ils lui envoyèrent deux hommes, le priant de ne pas tarder à venir vers eux.\n39\t Alors Pierre se leva et partit avec eux. Quand il fut arrivé, ils le firent entrer dans la chambre haute ; et toutes les veuves se tenaient près de lui, pleurant, et montrant les tuniques et les vêtements que Dorcas confectionnait, pendant qu'elle était avec elles.\n40\tMais Pierre les mit tous en avant, s'agenouilla et pria; et le tournant vers le corps dit   Tabitha, lève-toi. Et elle ouvrit les yeux   et quand elle vit Pierre, elle s'assit.\n41\tEt il lui tendit la main et la releva, et après avoir appelé les saints et les veuves, il la présenta vivante.\n42\tEt cela était connu dans tout Joppé ; et beaucoup crurent au Seigneur.\n43\tEt il arriva qu'il resta plusieurs jours à Joppé avec un certain Simon, tanneur.  **\n \nCertes, Tabitha aurait été enterrée ce jour-là, sauf qu'elle a été ramenée à la vie par Peter le jour même de sa mort. Quand Jésus a-t-il été enterré ? Le jour même de sa mort. Pourquoi certains croyants retardent-ils leur mort pendant des jours, des semaines, des mois et des années selon le modèle du monde festif ? Encore une fois ne gaspillez pas d'argent en frais mortuaires, transport inutile des morts sur de longues distances pour votre appauvrissement et celui des membres de votre famille. Vous ne pouvez pas aimer le défunt plus que Jésus. Obéissez à Jésus et ayez sa paix et sa bénédiction. 1 Corinthiens 4 verset 1,2  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 15 à 17  **\n15 Veillez donc à marcher avec circonspection, non comme des insensés, mais comme des sages, 16 rachetant le temps, car les jours sont mauvais.\n17 C'est pourquoi ne soyez pas insensés, mais comprenez quelle est la volonté du Seigneur.  **\n \n7.3 Raisons impies pour un enterrement retardé.  **\nLes peuples du monde retardent l'enterrement de leurs proches décédés pour les raisons suivantes    **\ni)\tRécolter suffisamment d'argent pour transporter le cadavre vers la destination souhaitée.  **\nii)\tPréparer la maison ou le lieu de sépulture pour répondre à la norme requise pour la louange et la recommandation humaines.  **\niii)\tPlanifier un enterrement de grande classe afin de montrer le statut de la famille dans la concurrence de la société avec les autres.  **\niv)\tRéunir suffisamment d'argent pour célébrer la cérémonie d'inhumation v) Planifier un divertissement approprié pour les invités.  **\nvi) Fournir des souvenirs de qualité aux participants.  ** vii) Pour gaspiller les ressources familiales sur leurs morts pour leur fierté.  **\nCelles-ci impliquent d'énormes contributions financières, des emprunts et des contrats d'inhumation avec d'autres pour les soutenir afin qu'eux aussi rendent le geste réciproque lorsque viendra leur tour de faire l'inhumation. Ce n'est pas la volonté de Dieu. Si les pécheurs le font, ne laissez pas les croyants se joindre à eux pour perdre le temps précieux et les ressources que Dieu leur a données.  **\nLuc 9 verset 59 à 60  **\n59\tEt il dit à un autre   Suis-le. Mais il dit   Seigneur, permets que j'aille d'abord ensevelir mon père.\n60\tJésus lui dit   Laisse les morts ensevelir leurs morts ; mais toi, va et prêche le royaume de Dieu.  **\n \nLes croyants doivent consacrer à la fois du temps et de l'argent à la diffusion de l'évangile du Seigneur Jésus qui donne le salut du péché, de Satan et de la mort éternelle et donne la vie éternelle aux âmes. Si le mort est allé en enfer, quel sens donnez-vous à ce temps et à cet argent démesurés ? Même si l'âme est partie au ciel, vaut-elle tous ces ennuis\nCependant, si quelques jours de préparation sont nécessaires pour sécuriser un lieu d'inhumation ou pour une préparation vitale, cela est acceptable. Le croyant doit toujours rechercher la direction du Saint-Esprit et les conseils de chrétiens sains.  **\n \n7.4 Cérémonie d'inhumation officielle  **\nGenèse 49 verset 33 ; 50 versets 1 à 13.  **\n34\tEt quand Jacob eut fini de commander à ses fils, il ramassa ses pieds dans le lit, et rendit l'esprit, et fut recueilli auprès de son peuple.\n50 1 Et Joseph tomba sur le visage de son père, pleura sur lui et le baisa\n2\tEt Joseph ordonna à ses serviteurs les médecins d'embaumer son père, et les médecins embaumèrent Israël.\n3\tEt quarante jours s'accomplirent pour lui; car ainsi s'accomplissent les jours de ceux qui sont embaumés, et les Égyptiens le pleurèrent soixante-dix jours.\n4\tet quand les jours de deuil furent passés, Joseph parla à la maison de Pharaon, disant   si maintenant j'ai trouvé grâce à vos yeux, parlez, je vous prie, aux oreilles de Pharaon, en disant\n5\tmon père m'a fait jurer, disant que je meurs   dans ma tombe que j'ai creusée pour moi dans le pays de Canaan, tu m'enterreras, maintenant donc, laisse-moi monter, je te prie, et ensevelir mon père, et Je reviendrai.\n5\tEt Pharaon dit   Monte et ensevelis ton père, comme il t'a fait jurer.\n6\tEt Joseph monta pour enterrer son père et montèrent avec lui tous les serviteurs du pharaon, les anciens de sa maison et tous les anciens du pays d'Égypte.\n7\tEt toute la maison de Joseph, et ses frères et la maison de son père; seulement là petits et leurs brebis et leurs troupeaux, ils laissèrent dans le pays de Goshen\n8\tEt il monta avec lui des chars et des cavaliers; et c'était une très grande compagnie.\n9\tEt ils vinrent à l'aire de battage d'Atad, qui est au-delà du Jourdain, et là ils pleurèrent avec une grande et très douloureuse lamentation et il fit le deuil de son père pendant sept jours\n10\tEt quand les habitants du pays, les Cananéens virent le deuil dans le sol d'Atad, ils dirent   C'est un deuil douloureux pour les Égyptiens, c'est pourquoi on l'appela Abelmizraïm, qui est au-delà du Jourdain. 11 Et ses fils firent à lui selon ce qu'il leur a commandé\n12 Car ses fils l'emportèrent dans le pays de Canaan, et l'enterrèrent dans la caverne du champ de Macpéla, qu'Abraham acheta avec le champ pour posséder le lieu de sépulture d'Ephron le Hittite, en face de Mamré.  **\nNous reconnaissons la cérémonie de décès et d'inhumation des hommes et des femmes de l'État qui nécessitent l'attention de la société et du gouvernement. Ce sont des hommes et des femmes de haut rang et de renommée.  **\n \nLe cas de Jacob dans l'Écriture était celui de l'enterrement d'État, les choses suivantes sont observées dans la mort et l'enterrement de Jacob  **\ni.\tJoseph est allé sur le cadavre de son père verset 1.  **\nii.\tL'enterrement de Jacobs était un enterrement d'État et a été repris par le gouvernement égyptien à l'époque de Joseph versets 4 à 9.  **\niii.\tJacob a fait jurer à Joseph qu'il serait enterré au pays de Canaan. Cette demande était conforme à la volonté de Dieu, le Dieu d'Abraham, d'Isaac et de Jacob. Ceux-ci ont tous été enterrés dans le pays de Canaan, le pays de la promesse. Ce n'est pas tout le monde qui donnera la condition de son enterrement qui doit être respectée, car ses demandes peuvent ne pas être conformes à la parole ou à la volonté de Dieu. Verset 4.  **\niv.\tLa cérémonie d'enterrement de Jacob était caractérisée par des pleurs et des deuils et non par des festins verset 10.  **\nv.\tNotez qu'en dehors du cas particulier de Jacob, il n'y a aucune trace dans les Écritures que les enfants d'Israël aient toujours été transportés au pays de Canaan où qu'ils soient morts.  ** **\n \n \nCHAPITRE HUIT  **\nACTIVITÉS CHRÉTIENNES ET PROCÉDURES D'ENTERREMENT  **\n \n8.1 Les arrangements funéraires ne doivent pas être compliqués.  **\nUne cérémonie d'inhumation peut être aussi simple que cela  **\ni) Les personnes en deuil et les consolateurs doivent être conduits en présence de Dieu dans la prière. ii) Ils doivent être conduits à la louange et à l'adoration.  **\niii)\tLes membres de la famille endeuillés peuvent être appelés pour une présentation aux gens.  **\niv)\tUne personne désignée peut se présenter devant la congrégation pour lire la biographie du défunt.  **\nv)\tUn ministre nommé peut s'avancer pour prêcher la parole de Dieu à l'auditoire. vi) La congrégation devrait être amenée à prier pour les membres de la famille endeuillés.  **\nvii) Les gens doivent ensuite se déplacer vers la tombe pour l'internement, pour abaisser le cercueil dans la tombe.  **\nCertaines cultures exigent que la femme et d'autres jettent de la terre dans la tombe pour signifier que son corps est retourné à la poussière d'où il vient.  **\nEcclésiaste 12 verset 7  **\n« Alors la poussière retournera à la terre comme elle était ; et l'esprit retournera à Dieu qui l'a donné.  **\nI) Des rafraîchissements peuvent être fournis aux personnes. Si la famille ou un membre de la famille a de l'argent ou des ressources, il devrait être dépensé pour organiser des croisades ou un programme édifiant pour le salut et l'édification des personnes qui viennent pour le programme d'enterrement.  **\nii)\tS'il y a assez d'argent pour donner des souvenirs aux gens, ce devrait être pour obtenir des matériaux chrétiens qui apportent des bienfaits spirituels aux âmes des hommes. De cette façon, la cérémonie d'enterrement d'une famille chrétienne est accomplie à la gloire de Dieu.  **\niii)\tCertains membres de la famille et des êtres chers peuvent vouloir rester dans la maison endeuillée pendant quelques jours. Il n'y a aucun problème à cela. Certaines familles utilisent le moment de l'enterrement pour régler leurs comptes et discuter de la paix et du progrès familiaux. C'est aussi bon. Mais tout doit être fait pour la gloire de Dieu.  **\n \n1 Corinthiens 10 verset 31  **\n« Soit donc que vous mangiez, soit que vous buviez, ou quoi que vous fassiez, faites tout pour la gloire de Dieu.  **\n \n1 Corinthiens 14 verset 14  **\n« Que tout se fasse décemment et dans l'ordre »  **\n \n8.2 Chercher à plaire à Dieu lors de l'enterrement.  **\nLa principale personne que vous devriez chercher à plaire est Dieu. La principale personne que vous devriez craindre et refuser de décevoir est Dieu, pas l'homme.  **\nGalates 1 verset 10, 11  **\n10\tCar est-ce que je persuade maintenant les hommes, ou Dieu ? ou est-ce que je cherche à plaire aux hommes ? car si je plaisais encore aux hommes, je ne serais pas le serviteur de Christ.\n11\tMais je vous certifie, frères, que l'évangile qui a été prêché à mon sujet n'est pas selon l'homme.  **\n \nS'il est en votre pouvoir de gérer la cérémonie d'inhumation, n'allez pas mendier de l'argent et ne permettez pas aux membres de votre famille de le faire. Que ceux qui veulent aider le fassent volontairement. Ne soyez pas flamboyant lors de la cérémonie d'inhumation. Dirigez et contrôlez toutes choses selon les Écritures et laissez Jésus être glorifié. Là où le croyant ne contrôle pas les membres de la famille et les relations incroyants, alors le croyant devrait apporter ce qui est à la lumière des Écritures et s'arrêter là. Ils peuvent proposer une grosse somme à contribuer, vous devez donner juste ce que vous pouvez vous permettre pour le simple enterrement d'un parent et vous arrêter là. Votre argent est responsable devant Dieu. N'ayez pas peur des sorcières et des sorciers dans votre famille, ou dans le village ou la société. Laissez les hommes et Satan être embarrassés par vous pour ne pas vous soumettre à la tradition et à la coutume impies du monde. N'embarrassez pas Dieu. Ne revenez pas à votre précieuse foi à cause d'une cérémonie funéraire.  **\n \nProverbes 23 verset 26  **\n« Mon fils, donne-moi ton cœur et que tes yeux observent mes voies. »  **\nProverbes 24 verset 21  **\n« Mon fils, crains l'Éternel et le roi, et ne te mêle pas de ceux qui sont adonnés au changement.\nSi vous surmontez les nombreuses tentations de la cérémonie funéraire, Dieu sera content de vous.  **\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 13 à 17  **\n13\tEt qui est celui qui vous fera du mal, si vous êtes partisans de ce qui est bon ?\n14\tMais et si vous souffrez pour la justice, heureux êtes-vous   et n'ayez pas peur de leur terreur, et ne soyez pas troublés ;\n15\tMais sanctifiez le Seigneur Dieu dans vos cœurs ; et sois toujours prêt à donner une réponse à tout homme qui te demande une raison de l'espérance qui est en toi avec douceur et crainte;\n16\tAvoir une bonne conscience; que, tandis qu'ils parlent mal de vous, comme des malfaiteurs, ils peuvent avoir honte qui accusent faussement votre bonne conversation en Christ.\n17\tCar il vaut mieux, si la volonté de Dieu l'est, que vous souffriez pour le bien que pour le mal.\nQui vous fera du mal lorsque vous suivez les instructions divines soutenues par la puissance divine ?  **\nLuc 10 verset 18 à 20  **\n18\tEt il leur dit   Je vis Satan comme un éclair tomber du ciel.\n19\tVoici, je vous donne le pouvoir de marcher sur les serpents et les scorpions, et sur toute la puissance de l'ennemi, et rien ne vous fera aucun mal.\n20\tQuoi qu'il en soit, ne vous réjouissez pas de ce que les esprits vous sont soumis ; mais réjouissez-vous plutôt, car vos noms sont inscrits dans les cieux.  **\n \nEsaïe 54 verset 14 à 17  **\n14\tDans la justice tu seras établi, tu seras loin de l'oppression; car tu n'auras ni peur ni terreur; car il ne s'approchera pas de toi.\n15\tVoici, ils se rassembleront sûrement, mais pas par moi   quiconque se rassemblera contre toi tombera à cause de toi.\n16\tVoici, j'ai créé le forgeron qui souffle les charbons dans le feu, et qui sort un instrument pour son travail; et j'ai créé le déchet pour le détruire.\n17\tAucune arme formée contre toi ne prospérera ; et toute langue qui s'élèvera contre toi en jugement, tu la condamneras. Ceci est l'héritage des serviteurs de l'Éternel, et leur justice vient de moi, dit l'Éternel.\nVoulez-vous plaire à Dieu ou aux hommes ? Si vous voulez plaire aux hommes, alors vous n'êtes pas un serviteur de Christ. Ne craignez pas la colère et l'accusation des membres de votre famille. Soutenez vos œuvres avec des prières ferventes et liez l'autorité des ténèbres et soumettez-les.  **\n2 Corinthiens 10 verset 3 à 6  **\n« Car bien que nous marchions dans la chair, nous ne combattons pas selon la chair ;\n(Car les armes de notre guerre ne sont pas charnelles, mais puissantes par Dieu pour abattre des prises fortes ;)\nAbattant les imaginations et toute chose élevée qui s'élève contre la connaissance de Dieu, et amenant toute pensée captive à l'obéissance de Christ;\nEt étant prêt à venger toute désobéissance, lorsque votre obéissance sera accomplie.\nL'Esprit vainqueur est en vous. Vous êtes né de Dieu et vous les avez vaincus parce que Celui qui est en vous est plus grand que celui qui est en eux. Beaucoup suivront votre bon exemple et seront délivrés de l'enfer en regardant votre vie exemplaire.  **  **\n \n \n\n\nCHAPITRE NEUF  **\nLA PAROLE DE DIEU SUR LES VEUVES ET LES orphelins  **\n \n9.1 Ce que la veuve doit savoir  **\nColossiens 2 verset 6 à 8  **\n6\tComme vous avez donc reçu Christ Jésus le Seigneur, marchez en lui;\n7\tEnracinés et édifiés en lui, et affermis dans la foi, comme on vous l'a enseigné, abondant en actions de grâces.\n8\tPrenez garde qu'aucun homme ne vous gâte par la philosophie et par de vaines tromperies, d'après la tradition des hommes, d'après les rudiments du monde, et non d'après Christ.\nMaintenez votre vie de justice et de sainteté. Laissez-vous guider par la parole de Dieu en tout. Marchez dans la liberté du Christ et ne vous soumettez pas aux coutumes et traditions des hommes sur votre mari décédé qui sont contraires à la parole de Dieu.  **\nGalates 5 verset 1  **\n«Tenez donc fermes dans la liberté par laquelle Christ nous a rendus libres, et ne soyez plus empêtrés sous le joug de la servitude.»  **\n \nNe vous soumettez pas à des règles telles que  **\ni)\tVous couper, ou imprimer des marques sur votre corps, ou ne porter qu'un seul vêtement pendant une période de temps stipulée, ou ne porter qu'un tissu noir, ou vous couper les cheveux, ou rester à l'intérieur pendant un certain temps, ou tout ce que la tradition impie peut exiger . Cela ne vous est pas demandé par le Seigneur. Par conséquent, refusez de les faire.  **\nLévitique 19 verset 28  **\n« Vous ne ferez aucune incision dans votre chair pour les morts, et vous n'imprimerez aucune marque sur vous   je suis l'Éternel.  **\nii)\tApparaître devant une idole ou jurer par elle pour n'importe quelle cause. Ne vous y soumettez pas même face à la menace ou à la pression.  **\niii)\tTransférer votre relation conjugale à un autre parent de votre mari décédé. Votre relation conjugale avec cette famille et la dot qui vous a été versée ont pris fin au décès de votre mari. A la mort de votre mari, votre famille n'a plus de pouvoir conjugal sur vous. La personne qui devrait vous donner un mari maintenant est Dieu et l'homme doit être un vrai chrétien qui paiera une nouvelle dot ou un prix de la mariée sur vous.  **\nPremier Corinthiens 7 verset 39, 40  **\n39\tLa femme est liée par la loi aussi longtemps que son mari vit ; mais si son mari est mort, elle est libre d'épouser qui elle veut ; seulement dans le Seigneur\n40\tmais elle est plus heureuse si elle demeure ainsi, après mon jugement et je pense aussi que j'ai l'Esprit de Dieu  **\n \n9.2 Traitement approprié des veuves et des orphelins.  **\nLe Seigneur lui-même est l'époux des veuves et le père des orphelins.  **\nPsaume 68 verset 5  **\n\"Un père pour les orphelins et un juge pour les veuves, c'est Dieu dans sa sainte demeure.\"\nIl prend soin des veuves et des orphelins. Par conséquent, Il ne veut pas qu'une personne ou une famille maltraite une veuve ou un orphelin parce que le chef de famille est décédé et qu'ils n'ont personne d'autre pour les protéger. Dieu place une malédiction sur les oppresseurs de la veuve et de l'orphelin.  **\nDeutéronome 27 verset 19  **\n« Maudit soit celui qui pervertit le jugement de l'étranger, de l'orphelin et de la veuve. Et tout le peuple dira   Amen.\nEnfants de Dieu et vous qui craignez Dieu, n'opprimez pas la femme de votre frère et ses enfants après sa mort. Dans la mesure où cela relève de votre pouvoir, ne permettez à aucun membre de votre famille de le faire non plus. C'est mal aux yeux de Dieu et cela encourra Sa colère sur la famille.  **\n \nExode 22 verset 22  **\n\"Vous n'affligerez aucune veuve ou enfant orphelin.\"  **\nJob 22 verset 9  **\n\"Tu as renvoyé les veuves à vide, et les bras des orphelins ont été brisés.\"  **\n9.3 L'avertissement de Dieu contre le mauvais traitement des veuves et des orphelins.  **\nEphésiens 4 verset 17 à 24  **\n17\tJe dis donc ceci, et j'atteste dans le Seigneur, que vous ne marchez plus désormais comme marchent les autres Gentils, dans la vanité de leur esprit,\n18\tAyant l'intelligence obscurcie, étant éloignés de la vie de Dieu par l'ignorance qui est en eux, à cause de l'aveuglement de leur cœur ;\n19\tQui, ayant perdu tout sentiment, se sont livrés à la lascivité, pour travailler toute impureté avec avidité. 20 Mais vous n'avez pas ainsi appris Christ ;\n21\tSi donc vous l'avez entendu, et avez été instruits par lui, comme la vérité est en Jésus ;\n22\tQue vous rebutiez concernant l'ancienne conversation le vieil homme, qui est corrompu selon les convoitises trompeuses;\n23\tEt soyez renouvelé dans l'esprit de votre esprit;\n24\tEt que vous revêtiez l'homme nouveau, qui selon Dieu est créé dans la justice et la vraie sainteté.  **\n  \n1.\tÉvitez de faire le mal contre la famille des morts. Évitez la méchanceté contre la veuve (la femme du mort) et contre l'orphelin (les enfants du mort).  **\n2.\tÉvitez la cupidité et la convoitise contre l'argent et les biens du défunt qu'il a rassemblés pour sa famille. Les pécheurs courront après ces biens et diront  \"Pas d'enterrement tant que vous n'apportez pas le compte bancaire\" ou jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient en mesure de prendre tous les biens. Ils n'ont aucun sentiment ou sympathie humaine. Ils sont en file d'attente pour le jugement divin. Ne vous joignez pas à eux pour trahir la veuve. La femme a des enfants, et maintenant vous voulez prendre tous les biens de la maison, en prétendant qu'ils appartiennent à votre frère. Votre frère les a-t-il acquis pour vous ? Qui pourvoira aux besoins des enfants ? Tout est méchanceté !  **\nSi vous vainquez cette femme parce que vous dites qu'elle est une femme faible, le Dieu des veuves se battra pour elle et s'occupera de vous. Vous êtes peut-être plus fort qu'elle, mais il y a aussi quelqu'un de plus fort que vous. Vous voulez lui faire honte ? Dieu de la veuve te fera honte aussi. N'aurez-vous pas de sympathie pour les enfants du défunt sur la façon dont ils vivront et survivront ? Enfant de Dieu ne rejoignez pas ces méchants parce que vous êtes un enfant de Dieu. S'il y a quelque chose que la femme donnera pour vous aider, qu'elle le donne de son plein gré. Si vous avez besoin de faire une demande, faites-le avec douceur et non avec force. Même si la femme n'a pas eu d'enfant pour l'homme, il n'en reste pas moins qu'elle a travaillé avec son mari pendant toutes ces années pour acquérir la propriété. N'aura-t-elle donc pas sa part ? Est-elle aussi morte le jour où le mari est mort ? Ne vivra-t-elle pas et ne mangera-t-elle pas ? Tout doit se régler à l'amiable et à sa satisfaction même si elle décide de retourner chez son père ou d'épouser une autre personne. Soyez juste et équitable envers elle afin que Dieu bénisse votre famille. Je parle à ceux qui sont liés à son mari qui ont la crainte de Dieu .  **\nJean 13 verset 17  **\n\"Si vous savez ces choses, heureux êtes-vous si vous les faites.\"\nSoyez comme le Psalmiste qui a dit   Je suis résolu à ce que mes lèvres ne transgressent pas. Soyez aussi comme Daniel qui a refusé de se souiller avec ce qui se passait au collège.  ** **\n \n \nCHAPITRE 10  **\nRÉVÉLATION DIVINE D'UN RETARDÉ QUI EST ALLÉ EN ENFER  **\n \nJe m'appelle Sœur Linda Paul Rika. Je partage avec vous une révélation que le Seigneur Jésus m'a montrée le 9 avril 2014 au sujet du défunt pasteur Moses Semeka. Le défunt pasteur Moses Semeka était pasteur et membre de Deeper Life Bible Church. Il a également été coordinateur du Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, non confessionnel.  **\n \n10.1 La voix continue de me dire que Moïse Semeka a raté le paradis.  **\nAprès la mort du pasteur Moses Semeka en juin 2013, j'ai commencé à entendre une voix me témoigner qu'il manquait le paradis. J'ai réprimandé la voix parce que j'ai dit que le pasteur était un saint homme. J'ai également noté que Dieu lui a donné un long moment sur le lit de malade pour la repentance et la restitution. Nous lui avons même rendu visite dans deux des hôpitaux où il a été admis à Abuja. J'en ai conclu que la voix venait de Satan parce que le pasteur connaissait toutes les doctrines de la sainteté et faisait partie de ceux qui enseignaient les autres. J'ai résisté à cette voix parce que je doutais que ce ne soit pas Dieu qui me parlait. Mais cette voix me revenait même quand je travaillais dans la cuisine, prenais mon bain ou parlais aux gens. La voix me disait que le pasteur était en enfer.  **\nHébreu 12 verset 14  **\n\"Suivez la paix avec tous les hommes et la sainteté, sans laquelle personne ne verra le Seigneur.\"  **\nJob 13 verset 16  **\n« Lui aussi sera mon salut, car un hypocrite ne viendra pas devant lui. »\nJe me suis dit, quel genre de chose est-ce? Je n'étais pas si proche de ce pasteur car je suis venu au Nigeria en avril 2013 et il est décédé en juin de la même année. Pourquoi est-ce que je pensais comme ça ? Ce n'était même pas le fait que je gardais en tête sa scène de mort qui devait me faire penser à lui. Papa Paul Rika ne nous a parlé de sa mort que lorsque nous étions à Kaduna et nous avons prié à ce sujet et j'ai tout oublié. mais, cette voix a continué et j'ai continué à la réprimander. Le 9 avril 2014, moi et mon mari, le pasteur Paul Rika, priions ensemble le matin vers 7h30. Pendant que nous chantions, la pensée est revenue   Moses Semeka a raté le paradis. Mon mari voulait prendre un point de prière, mais je l'ai interrompu et lui ai dit qu'il devait attendre. Je lui ai raconté ce qui m'arrivait après qu'il nous ait annoncé la mort du pasteur Moses Semeka. Je lui ai dit qu'une voix me disait que le pasteur était en enfer. Alors que j'expliquais au pasteur Rika, j'ai entendu la voix me dire à nouveau,\n« Vous ne croyez pas ce que je vous dis que Moïse Semeka a raté le paradis ? Maintenant,\nJe te le ferai entendre en direct de l'enfer pour que tu saches que c'est vrai.  **\nMatthieu 24 verset 51  **\n\"Et le coupera en deux et lui assignera sa part avec les hypocrites, là seront les pleurs et les grincements de dents.\"  **\n \n10.2 Moïse Semeka a reçu le jugement de Dieu sur ses péchés.  **\nImmédiatement, j'ai commencé à entendre le décret de jugement contre lui. J'ai entendu une voix poser des questions au pasteur Moses Semeka et je l'ai reconnue comme la voix du Seigneur Jésus.\nLa première question était   pourquoi n'étiez-vous pas sérieux dans votre vie chrétienne ? Pourquoi avez-vous été négligent avec Mon travail ?\nLe pasteur Rika était assis à mes côtés, mais parce que la voix du Seigneur était puissante et terrible, je ne pouvais plus l'entendre. Ensuite, j'ai entendu la voix du pasteur Moses Semeka répondre d'une manière triste et douloureuse  «Seigneur, je travaillais dans ton mouvement et j'assistais à ta sainte église, Deeper Life Bible Church. J'ai lu ma Bible et j'ai communié avec Ton peuple saint. J'ai payé mes dîmes et mes offrandes. Je te connais, Seigneur\nJésus. Ayez pitié de moi.\"  **\n\nMatthieu 7 verset 21 verset 23  **\n21\tce ne sont pas tous ceux qui me disent, Seigneur, Seigneur qui entreront dans le royaume des cieux, mais celui qui fait la volonté de mon Père qui est dans les cieux.\n22\tPlusieurs me diront en ce jour-là   Seigneur Seigneur, n'avons-nous pas prophétisé en ton nom ?\nEt en ton nom ont chassé les démons ? Et en ton nom fait beaucoup de merveilles ?\n23\tEt alors je leur professerai que je ne vous ai jamais connus, éloignez-vous de moi, vous qui avez commis l'iniquité  **\nEt la voix terrible dit   « Tu as dit que tu Me connais, Moïse Semeka ? De quelle manière M'as-tu connu ? De quelle manière avez-vous bénéficié du Holiness Revival Movement et de l'Église avec laquelle vous adoriez en Mon nom ? Comment ta vie a-t-elle été affectée alors que tu étais encore dans tes péchés ? » Et le pasteur a répondu; \"Seigneur, j'avais l'intention de payer ma dette, de faire mes restitutions et de remettre ma vie en ordre, mais la mort est venue sur moi. Le Seigneur a pitié.\"  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 5 verset 2,3  **\n« Car vous savez parfaitement que le jour du Seigneur vient comme un voleur dans la nuit.\nCar quand ils diront   paix et sécurité, alors une destruction soudaine viendra sur eux, comme le travail sur une femme enceinte ; et ils n'échapperont pas.  **\n \nET LE SEIGNEUR JÉSUS A PRONONCÉ SUR LUI UN JUGEMENT AINSI  **\n\"Tu n'as pas tenu ma parole. J'ai envoyé plusieurs messages au monde disant que le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté est mon mouvement, mais vous jouiez avec ma parole comme si j'étais un homme comme vous. Vous n'avez pas promu Mon Mouvement. Vous n'avez pas gagné des âmes comme je l'attendais de vous. Tu craignais l'homme et tu t'accrochais toujours à tes péchés, Moïse. Vous n'avez pas suivi la paix avec tous les hommes. Tu as porté des péchés secrets que les hommes ne connaissaient pas, mais moi, ton Créateur, je savais ce que tu cachais. Tout ce qu'un homme fait, je le sais ; même les choses que vous avez oubliées, moi, le Seigneur, je le sais. J'ai envoyé un message à Deeper Life Bible Church pour les avertir de Mon jugement mais ils n'ont pas voulu entendre. Ils l'ont négligé à cause de la peur de l'homme. Maintenant, vous êtes ici comme beaucoup d'entre eux. Qui va te sauver maintenant Moïse ?\nJe t'ai montré de la miséricorde en te donnant le bon privilège de te purifier de tes péchés secrets et de perfectionner ta vie, pourtant tu t'es accroché à tes péchés. Moïse, est-ce que ton temps est entre tes mains ou dans Ma main ? Maintenant que tu es là, il n'y a plus de pitié. Éloignez-vous de Moi Moïse Semeka ! L'enfer est le lieu de tous les enfants désobéissants.  **\n \nPsaume9 verset 17  **\n\"Les méchants seront changés en enfer, et toutes les nations qui oublient Dieu.\"\nSoudain, j'ai entendu la voix du pasteur Moïse crier   « Aie pitié ; Le Seigneur a pitié; Le Seigneur a pitié.\" Puis j'ai cessé de l'entendre. Ce que j'ai entendu ensuite, ce sont des cris de multitudes dans le feu de l'enfer. Après avoir entendu les cris, je suis tombée entre les mains de mon mari en lui disant   « Couvre-moi les oreilles ; bouche mes oreilles; Je ne veux pas entendre parler de l'enfer ; » parce que les sons de l'enfer étaient très terribles. (Hébreux 10 31)  **\nSoudain, j'ai entendu une voix distincte des autres voix que j'entendais de l'enfer. La voix a commencé à appeler mon nom   « Sœur Linda, sœur Linda, pardonne-moi. Je n'ai pas été convaincu par votre témoignage. Ohhh, dis à notre sœur de me pardonner. Ah, Seigneur, c'est douloureux ici. Mon cœur était amer contre elle. Le Seigneur a pitié. J'ai eu des péchés secrets dans ma vie alors que j'étais parmi vous dans le Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. Ah, Seigneur, aie pitié; qu'est-ce que je me suis fait ? Je n'ai pas payé la dette que je devais à certaines personnes. J'ai le péché de ne pas pardonner, et le Seigneur m'a jugé pour ne pas avoir suivi la paix avec tous les hommes. Oh mon Dieu aie pitié ! Pourquoi ai-je vécu négligemment dans ma vie chrétienne ? Me voir maintenant; J'ai mal. Cet endroit est trop douloureux ; Seigneur, aie pitié de moi.  **\nLuc 16 verset 24  **\n« Et il cria et dit Père Abraham, aie pitié de moi, et envoie Lazare, afin qu'il trempe le bout de son doigt dans l'eau, et refroidisse ma langue ; car je suis tourmenté dans cette flamme.\nJe médisais et bavardais avec certains de mes amis à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur du Holiness Revival Movement. Dites-leur d'arrêter parce que Dieu voit tout. Oh!\nMême ma femme, je n'ai pas réussi à la nourrir dans la crainte du Seigneur, à garder ses voies. J'ai encouragé ma femme dans le péché. Voyez-moi souffrir maintenant. Prier pour moi. Le Seigneur a pitié.\"\nQuand il a dit tout cela, j'ai commencé à l'entendre grincer des dents et pleurer amèrement.  ***\nMatthieu 13 verset 50  **\n« Et les jettera dans la fournaise ardente, où il y aura des gémissements et des grincements de dents. »  **\n \n10.3 Moïse Semeka a envoyé des remontrances.  **\n \nMoïse Semeka a continué ,  **\n\"Dis à ma femme de pardonner aux gens avec qui elle est amère. Dites-lui de pardonner à mes amis et aux autres relations avec lesquelles elle est amère. Dites-lui de payer toutes ses dettes et de s'immerger dans l'enseignement et les activités du Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide dans la vie et la pratique. Si vous ne faites pas de promotion ou de sérieux avec le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté ou avec votre vie chrétienne, s'il vous plaît mon peuple, faites-le maintenant pour ne pas venir en enfer. L'enfer est douloureux. O Seigneur, aie pitié de moi. Dieu aime ce Mouvement et juge les gens à cause de cela.\n  \nDis à papa Rika que je suis désolé. Je n'étais pas engagé dans la propagation du mouvement de la sainteté à cause de la persécution de Deeper Life. Dites-lui de prier pour moi. C'est douloureux ici. Priez que Dieu me renvoie comme Il l'a fait vers Sœur Linda et Frère Michael Sambo, afin que je puisse avertir le monde du feu de l'enfer. C'est trop ici papa.\nPuis j'ai commencé à l'entendre dire des choses dans son\nLangage « tiv » que je ne comprenais pas.\nPar la suite, il a dit   « Dites aux coordinateurs du Mouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde de s'immerger dans l'enseignement du Mouvement. Laissez-les prendre l'enseignement au sérieux et changer leur vie. Qu'ils n'aillent pas en enfer. Ils devraient prendre le Mouvement comme leur ministère parce que Dieu juge les gens pour cela. À quel point êtes-vous sérieux avec le Mouvement de Dieu ?\nAvertir l'église biblique Deeper Life. Beaucoup de leurs membres sont ici en enfer et d'autres sont également présents ici. Ils subiront le jugement de Dieu s'ils ne se repentent pas pour les raisons suivantes  **\ni.\tIl y a un manque de véritable amour chrétien dans leur vie.  **\nii.\tIls sont fiers de leur vie chrétienne, se considérant comme supérieurs aux autres chrétiens.  **\niii.\tBeaucoup de leurs membres ont des péchés secrets. iv. \tIls ne gagnent pas d'âmes à Christ.  **\n \nCe jugement est prononcé par le Seigneur lui-même sur ces membres de Deeper Life ici qui viennent en enfer. Dites à Deeper Life Bible Church que ce sont quelques-unes des raisons pour lesquelles leurs membres finissent en enfer. Dites-leur que le diable se moque de nous en disant que j'ai jeté le sort de peur dans l'église biblique Deeper Life et que je les ai retenus captifs de la peur de l'homme. Ils ne savent pas qu'ils ont déjà failli aux commandements de Dieu. À cause de cela, beaucoup d'entre eux vont en enfer. Satan se moque de notre damnation et nous traite de fous. Dites-leur de gagner des âmes et d'aimer les autres chrétiens. Ils devraient mettre de côté toutes sortes de péchés secrets et travailler à leur salut individuellement. Ils devraient sortir et évangéliser et éloigner d'eux la peur de l'homme. Ils devraient être sérieux au sujet de leur vie chrétienne.  **\n \n10.4 Remarques sur Moïse Semeka.  **\nMes frères, ceci est le message de l'enfer. Pourquoi Jésus fait-il cela ? Il fait tout son possible pour s'assurer que nous allons au ciel. S'il vous plaît, si vous êtes sous le pouvoir confessionnel de l'homme, ou la peur de l'homme, vous vous mettez en danger. Notre défunt pasteur Moïse était pasteur sous Deeper Life mais la dénomination ne l'a pas sauvé à cause de la peur de l'homme. Il n'a pas fait la volonté de Dieu. Il craignait ce que l'Église dénominationnelle ou le pasteur lui ferait, s'il exécutait la volonté de Dieu dans le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté.  **\n \nPremier Jean 4 verset 18 ;  **\nIl n'y a pas de peur dans l'amour; mais l'amour parfait chasse la peur, parce que la peur est tourmente. Celui qui craint n'est pas rendu parfait dans l'amour.  **\nProverbes 29 verset 25  **\n« La crainte de l'homme tend un piège ; mais quiconque place sa confiance en l'Éternel sera en sécurité.  **\n  \n10.5 Cérémonie funéraire de Moïse Semeka.  **\nEcclésiaste 7 verset 2 à 4  **\n2\tIl vaut mieux aller à la maison de deuil qu'à la maison de festin ; car c'est la fin de tous les hommes ; et les vivants la mettront sur son coeur.\n3\tLe chagrin vaut mieux que le rire; car par la tristesse du visage le cœur est rendu meilleur\n4\tLe cœur du sage est dans la maison de deuil ; mais le cœur des insensés est dans la maison de la joie.  **\n \nL'histoire de Moïse Semeka est bien connue de moi l'écrivain. Moses Semeka, un homme Tiv de l'État de Benue, au Nigéria, était membre de l'église biblique Deeper Life Makurdi et l'un des pasteurs. Lorsqu'il a rejoint le mouvement de la sainteté, je l'ai nommé coordonnateur de l'État de Benue du mouvement de réveil de la sainteté. Il montra beaucoup de zèle mais mourut après une longue maladie.\nSœur Linda Paul Rika est ma femme. Elle a reçu cette expérience divine de Jésus en ma présence. La principale chose à considérer ici est la cérémonie d'inhumation   **\n \ni.\tSon corps doit-il être gardé longtemps à la morgue en vue d'une grande cérémonie funéraire ?  **\nii.\tEst-ce que tout l'argent de la famille, y compris les emprunts et les prêts, devrait être utilisé pour lui offrir un grand enterrement ?  **\niii.\tDevrait-il y avoir manger et boire dans les festins avec des danses en célébration lors de la cérémonie funéraire ? iv. Devrait-il y avoir un deuxième enterrement, un troisième enterrement doit-il être pratiqué sur lui ?  **\nv. \tDieu serait-il heureux et glorifié si ces choses étaient faites sur quelqu'un dans le feu de l'enfer pour son jugement .\nvi. \tLes voies de Dieu sont différentes des voies de l'homme.  **\n\nEsaïe 55 verset 7 à 9  **\n7\tque le méchant abandonne sa voie, et l'homme injuste ses pensées ; et qu'il retourne vers l'Éternel; et il aura pitié de lui; et à notre Dieu, car il pardonnera abondamment\n8\tCar mes pensées ne sont pas vos pensées, et vos voies ne sont pas mes voies, dit l'Éternel.\n9\tCar, comme les cieux sont plus hauts que la terre, mes voies sont plus hautes que vos voies, et mes pensées sont vos pensées.  **\n \nvii. Suivez la parole de Dieu, célébrez la cérémonie d'enterrement dans un esprit de deuil et non de festin. **  **\n \n\nCHAPITRE 11  **\nUN SAINT QUI EST ALLÉ AU CIEL.  **\n \nEncore une fois, je suis Sœur Linda Paul Rika. Je partage ici une révélation bénie que le Seigneur m'a donnée concernant feu notre sœur Zenum Tanko Hassan qui est décédée le 13 janvier 2014. Sœur Zenum était l'une des sept femmes que le directeur international, le pasteur Paul Rika, a choisies pour prier. le ministère, Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. Le 13 janvier 2014, le pasteur Rika a appelé les sept femmes à venir à Abuja pour la prière en préparation de la prochaine Conférence internationale sur le leadership. En route vers Abuja depuis Lagos, elle a eu un accident qui a entraîné sa mort.  **\n \n11.1 Sœur Zenum est arrivée au paradis.  **\nEsaïe 57 verset 1,2  **\n1\tLe juste périt, et personne ne le prend à cœur; et les hommes miséricordieux sont enlevés, personne ne considère que le juste est enlevé du mal à venir.\n2\tIl entrera en paix   ils reposeront dans leurs lits, chacun marchant dans sa droiture  **\nSœur Zenum ne m'était pas clairement connue ; cependant, elle m'a été décrite et je me suis souvenu du cadeau qu'elle m'avait donné. Mais encore, je ne me souvenais plus de son visage. Au début, j'étais troublé par l'accident et sa mort, mais plus tard, je me suis senti en paix et je suis devenu calme. Je pensais que j'appréciais cette paix parce que je ne la connaissais pas bien. Au cours de la veillée funèbre du 30 janvier 2014, des frères ont témoigné de son mode de vie saint chrétien avant son départ. L'un de nos pasteurs qui a prêché au réveil a dit avec confiance que sœur Zenum était au paradis. Lorsque le pasteur a dit cela, j'ai entendu la voix du Seigneur Jésus me dire   « Ma fille, je suis ici. Beaucoup disent dans leur cœur   « Est-ce parce que Zenum a rejoint le Holiness Revival Movement qu'elle se qualifie pour entrer au ciel ? N'essaient-ils pas seulement de promouvoir leur ministère ?\nBeaucoup ne croient pas quand Je dis dans Ma sainte parole que sans la sainteté personne ne Me verra. Demain, je vous montrerai comment Zenum a créé le paradis afin que vous le partagiez avec eux lors du service funéraire. Cela aidera ceux qui ne croient pas encore à la sainteté à y croire et à la pratiquer.\nQuand je me suis réveillé le matin et que j'observais mon temps de silence, le Seigneur Jésus a dit   « Ma fille, je suis ici pour te montrer ce que je t'ai dit hier sur la façon dont sœur Zenum est arrivée au ciel. Je vais aussi vous montrer comment ils la persécutaient et l'appelaient de toutes sortes de noms dans l'Église et parmi certains de ses parents.  **\nPsaume 1 5 verset 1 à 5  **\n1\tSeigneur, qui demeurera dans ton tabernacle ? Qui habitera ta colline sainte ?\n2\tCelui qui marche dans l'intégrité, qui pratique la justice et qui dit la vérité dans son cœur.\n3\tCelui qui ne médise pas avec sa langue, ne fait pas de mal à son prochain, et n'adresse pas d'opprobre à son prochain\n4\tAux yeux de qui une personne vile est méprisée ; mais il honore ceux qui craignent le Seigneur. Celui qui jure sur son propre mal et qui ne change pas.\n5\tCelui qui ne prête pas son argent à l'usure, ni ne prend de récompense contre l'innocent. Celui qui fait cela ne sera jamais ébranlé.  **\n \n11.2 Comment Zenum est arrivé au paradis.  **\nInstantanément, je me suis vu sur les lieux de l'accident. J'ai vu le véhicule se déplacer mais pas à grande vitesse. L'ennemi a attaqué ce véhicule et le conducteur ne pouvait pas comprendre ce qui se passait. Il a commencé à lutter avec la direction et le véhicule a commencé à faire des culbutes. Sœur Zenum a été jetée par la fenêtre de la voiture et sa tête a heurté le sol et s'est brisée. Alors qu'elle atterrissait et que du sang commençait à jaillir d'elle, les gens autour ont commencé à crier à l'aide pour la sauver. De nombreuses personnes se sont précipitées sur les lieux de l'accident, mais soudain, son âme est sortie de son corps. Elle resta debout à regarder son corps et découvrit qu'elle était deux – l'une debout et l'autre allongée. Elle était surprise de se voir deux. Elle a commencé à demander aux gens autour d'elle   « Que se passe-t-il ? Que se passe-t-il? Pourquoi suis-je deux ? Mais les gens ne l'entendaient pas. Elle était confuse et a commencé à courir de haut en bas. Puis, une voix d'homme l'a appelée deux fois   « Zenum ! Zénum !\" Elle se tourna et vit l'homme debout de l'autre côté de la route et traversa pour le rencontrer. Elle a dit   « Dieu merci, vous m'entendez. Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici? Pourquoi est-ce que je me vois deux ? L'homme répondit   « Je suis un ange envoyé par Jésus pour vous emmener au ciel. Vous êtes morts. Dites adieu au monde. Elle s'est exclamée   « Ah, ah, c'est donc vrai ! Alors, la sainteté est vraie ! Alors je suis allé au paradis ? Elle était extrêmement heureuse et agissait comme si elle était hors de sens. Avec une grande joie, elle ne cessait de demander,\n« Alors je suis allé au paradis ? Je suis arrivé au paradis. Donc cette chose est vraie ! Alors la sainteté est vraie ! Alors ce que je croyais est vrai !  **\nJean 14 verset 1 à 3  **\n1\tque votre coeur ne soit pas troublé vous croyez en Dieu, croyez aussi en moi\n2\tdans la maison de mon Père il y a plusieurs demeures ; s'il n'en était pas ainsi, je vous l'aurais dit. Je vais préparer un emplacement pour vous.\n3\tEt si je m'en vais et que je vous prépare une place, je reviendrai et je vous recevrai en moi; là où je suis, vous y serez peut-être aussi.  **\nPuis elle s'est tournée vers l'homme et a dit   « Les membres de ma famille ne savent pas que je suis arrivé au paradis. Je ne veux pas qu'ils soient tristes de ma mort. Comment puis-je leur dire, ainsi qu'à mes amis et aux membres de l'Église, qu'ils ne doivent pas pleurer parce que je suis arrivé au ciel ? Comment puis-je faire cela parce que ces gens ne m'entendent pas ? » Alors l'ange répondit   « Ne t'inquiète pas. Jésus a envoyé sa paix à ses enfants justes et saints qui croient en lui dans la sainteté et la justice à ceux que vous êtes au ciel. Ne vous souciez pas de ce que vous voulez leur dire. Quand elle a entendu cela, elle a été consolée et heureuse.  **\n \nJean 14 verset 27  **\n\"La paix que je vous laisse, je vous donne ma paix, non comme le monde la donne, je vous la donne, que votre cœur ne soit pas troublé, qu'il n'ait pas peur\"\n \nElle a vu comment son corps a été transporté à l'hôpital. Lorsque le mari est venu à l'hôpital et a vu le corps de sa femme, il s'est levé et la regardait avec une profonde tristesse. Elle a commencé à l'appeler   « Tanko, Tanko, rejoins-moi ici. Je l'ai fait. S'il vous plaît, ne souffrez pas. La sainteté est vraie. S'il vous plaît, accrochez-vous à la sainteté. Attire mes enfants à la sainteté. Ne quittez pas la sainteté, suivez la sainteté. La sainteté m'a amené ici. J'ai fait le paradis, dites à mes enfants de ne pas pleurer parce que je suis arrivé au paradis. Elle a continué à parler à son mari pour qu'il puisse l'entendre. « Tanko, regarde-moi. Je suis là. Je l'ai fait.\" Alors l'ange a tenu sa main et il y avait une force qui les a emportés à travers le ciel. Elle a commencé à saluer son mari, souriante et heureuse alors qu'ils montaient. L'ange aussi souriait, elle a continué à saluer le monde, en disant \"j'ai réussi\" jusqu'à ce que le nuage les ait retirés de ma vue. Jésus m'a montré comment ils sont entrés dans la nuée et comment ils sont allés au ciel. Je l'ai vue au milieu des anges, vêtue d'un vêtement blanc et louant Dieu. Son vêtement était brillant, brillant et brillant comme la lumière. Les saints et les anges saluaient et adoraient Dieu. Elle était si heureuse, adorant Dieu parmi eux.  **\nAlors le Seigneur ferma la vision de mes yeux.  **\nApocalypse 7 verset 13 à 17  **\n«Et l'un des anciens répondit, me disant  Quels sont ceux qui sont vêtus de robes blanches? Et d'où venaient-ils ?\nEt je lui dis   Seigneur, tu le sais. Et il me dit  Ce sont ceux qui sont sortis d'une grande tribulation, et qui ont lavé leurs robes, et les ont blanchies dans le sang de l'Agneau\nC'est pourquoi, ils sont devant le trône de Dieu, et le servent jour et nuit dans son temple, et celui qui est assis sur le trône habitera parmi eux.\nIls n'auront plus faim, ni soif ; ni le soleil ne les éclairera, ni aucune chaleur.\nCar l'Agneau qui est au milieu du trône les nourrira et les conduira aux sources d'eaux vives, et Dieu essuiera toute larme de leurs yeux.  **\n \nApocalypse 21 verset 4 à 7  **\n4\tEt Dieu essuiera toute larme de leurs yeux; Et il n'y aura plus ni mort, ni chagrin, ni cri, et il n'y aura plus de douleur, car les premières choses sont passées\n5\tEt celui qui était assis sur le trône dit   Voici, je fais toutes choses nouvelles. Et il me dit, écris ces paroles qui sont vraies et fidèles.\n6\tEt il me dit, c'est fait. Je suis l'Alpha et l'Oméga, le commencement et la fin. Je donnerai gratuitement à celui qui a soif de la fontaine de l'eau de la vie.\n7\tCelui qui vaincra héritera de toutes choses; Et je serai son Dieu, et il sera mon fils.  **\n \n11.3 Pourquoi Zenum est arrivé au paradis.  **\nPuis j'ai commencé à entendre une voix audible me disant,\n« Ma fille, as-tu vu comment Zenum est arrivé au paradis ? Maintenant, je veux vous dire pourquoi Zenum est monté au ciel afin que vous puissiez aller le dire à ceux qui ne croient pas en ma sainteté et ma justice.\nZenum était chrétien depuis de nombreuses années et était zélé dans Ma vigne. Elle a cru et m'a connu, mais elle n'était pas dans ma sainte voie. C'est pourquoi j'ai envoyé mon serviteur, le pasteur Apollos, à Lagos pour lui enseigner ma sainte voie et lui faire savoir que sans la sainteté, personne ne peut me voir. C'était parce que je savais que son temps était court sur terre. Elle a écouté Ma voix, a cru et a obéi à Mes paroles, et s'est transformée selon Mon saint standard, à la fois intérieurement et extérieurement. Elle fit toutes ses restitutions et emporta sur elle tous les biens de Jézabel ; bagues, boucles d'oreille, collier, chaînes, bracelet, permanente, attache, tissage, pantalon de laine, etc. Elle était zélée dans Ma vigne dans la droiture et la sainteté. Cela l'a amenée à trouver grâce à Mes yeux et la porte du ciel s'est ouverte pour qu'elle puisse y entrer. Elle M'a plu son Créateur dans son travail cette année-là.  **\n2 Corinthiens 7 verset 1  **\n\"Ayant donc ces promesses, bien-aimés, purifions-nous de toute souillure de la chair et de l'esprit, achevant la sainteté dans la crainte de Dieu.\"  **\n \nRomains 12 verset 1,2  **\n« Je vous supplie donc, frères, par la miséricorde de Dieu, d'offrir vos corps en sacrifice vivant, saint et agréable à Dieu, ce qui est votre service raisonnable.\nEt ne vous conformez pas à ce monde, mais soyez transformés par le renouvellement de votre esprit, afin que vous puissiez prouver quelle est cette volonté bonne, acceptable et parfaite de Dieu.\n \nMaintenant, allez leur dire au service funéraire parce que beaucoup de ceux qui l'ont persécutée dans l'église et dans la maison, et certains de ses amis et membres de sa famille sont là pour l'enterrement. Dis-leur que ce n'est pas le temps que tu as travaillé dans Ma vigne qui fera entrer quelqu'un au paradis. Ce qui leur donnera accès au ciel, c'est la justice et la sainteté. Dites à tous ceux qui pleurent pour Zenum de pleurer pour eux-mêmes. Dites à tous ceux qui l'appellent et se moquent d'elle parce qu'elle a décidé d'enlever toutes les propriétés sataniques de son corps que ceux qui doutent encore et n'ont pas cru en Mon message n'entreront pas dans Mon Royaume. Rien de ce qui souille n'y entrera. Dites-leur de s'accrocher à la sainteté intérieure et extérieure.  **\nAlors le Seigneur ferma la vision.  **\n \nApocalypse 3 verset 7 à 13  **\n«Et à l'ange de l'église de Philadelphie, écris; ces choses dit celui qui est saint, celui qui est vrai, celui qui a la clef de David, celui qui ouvre et personne ne ferme, et celui qui ferme et personne n'ouvre;\nJe connais tes oeuvres, voici, j'ai mis devant toi une porte ouverte, et personne ne peut la fermer; car tu as peu de force, et tu as gardé ma parole, et tu n'as pas renié mon nom\nVoici, je les ferai de la synagogue de Satan, qui se disent juifs et ne le sont pas, mais mentent, voici, je les ferai venir se prosterner devant tes pieds et connaître que je t'ai aimé.\nParce que tu as gardé la parole de ma patience, je te garderai aussi de l'heure de la tentation, qui viendra sur tout le monde, pour éprouver les habitants de la terre\nVoici, je viens bientôt, tiens ferme ce que tu as, afin que personne ne prenne ta couronne. Celui qui vaincra, je ferai une colonne dans le temple de mon Dieu, et il n'en sortira plus, et j'écrirai sur lui le nom de mon Dieu, et le nom de la ville de mon Dieu, qui est la nouvelle Jérusalem, qui descend du ciel d'auprès de mon Dieu, et j'écrirai sur lui mon nouveau nom. Que celui qui a des oreilles entende ce que l'Esprit dit aux Églises.  **\n \n11.4 Cérémonie funéraire de Sœur Zenum Tanko Hassan.  **\nNuméro 23 verset 10  **\n« Qui peut compter la poussière de Jacob et le nombre de la quatrième partie d'Israël ? Laissez-moi mourir de la mort du juste, et que ma fin soit comme la sienne ! \"\n \nLa cérémonie d'enterrement de sœur Zenum tenue à Takum, dans l'État de Taraba, au Nigeria. Moi et ma femme sœur Linda étions personnellement à la cérémonie. La révélation que le Seigneur lui a donnée était dans l'hôtel où nous logions. Elle s'est agenouillée à côté du lit ce matin-là en prière, pendant que je préparais le sermon à prêcher à l'enterrement. Le Seigneur lui a donné la vision à genoux ce samedi matin.  **\nNombres 24 verset 4 ,5.  **\n4\tIl a dit, celui qui a entendu la parole de Dieu, qui a vu la vision du Tout-Puissant, tombant en transe, mais ayant les yeux ouverts  \n5\tQue tes tentes sont belles, ô Jacob, et tes tabernacles, ô Israël !  **\nLa cérémonie d'enterrement de saint Zenum, l'épouse de notre frère bien-aimé Tanko Hassan et mère de trois enfants, était scripturairement simple, comme décrit précédemment dans ce livre.  **\n1.\tLes pleureuses réunies,\n2.\tDes chants d'adoration ont été élevés,\n3.\tLe cadavre a été placé devant tous pour voir,\n4.\tDes hymnes ont été chantés,\n5.\tLes gens ont donné des témoignages sur le défunt,\n6.\tSa biographie a été lue,\n7.\tJ'ai prêché le sermon,\n8.\tSis Linda a donné la révélation du Seigneur sur Zenum,\n9.\tDes prières ont été offertes,\n10.\tDes clichés instantanés ont été pris,\n11.\tLe corps a été couvert pour l'internement.  **\n \nMême si nous savions que Zenum était arrivée au ciel, il y avait du deuil à sa mort et son enterrement selon la nature humaine et le modèle scripturaire.  **\n \n1.\tIl y avait du deuil sur la mort de Jacob. Genèse. 50 verset 10,\n2.\tIl y avait du deuil sur la mort de Moïse. Deutéronome 34 verset 8,\n3.\tIl y avait du deuil sur la mort de Lazare Jean 11 verset 32 à 35.  **\n \nFaire le deuil avec prudence.  **\nPremier Thessaloniciens 4 versets 13 à 14  **\n13\tMais je ne voudrais pas que vous soyez des frères ignorants, concernant ceux qui dorment, afin que vous ne soyez pas affligés, comme d'autres qui n'ont aucun espoir.\n14\tCar si nous croyons que Jésus est mort et ressuscité, de même aussi ceux qui dorment en Jésus Dieu les amènera avec lui.  **\n \nVous avez remarqué dans le récit de révélation de Zenum qu'elle a envoyé du réconfort à ses proches les encourageant à ne pas pleurer parce qu'elle était arrivée au paradis, bien que ses paroles n'aient pas été entendues, étant maintenant retirée du domaine physique. Le Seigneur veut que les autres croyants pleurent et pleurent avec paix parce que le défunt frère ou sœur est parti pour être avec le Seigneur et si nous restons dans la justice et la sainteté du Christ jusqu'à la fin, nous les rencontrerons à nouveau et serons dans une communion éternelle. On ne voit pas dans les Écritures et à l'époque contemporaine que même la cérémonie d'enterrement d'un saint était célébrée de manière festive en mangeant, buvant, riant, chantant, dansant dans la jubilation. Soyez scripturaire, soyez saint.  **\n \nMINISTERE DU REVEIL DE LA SAINTETE DANS LE MONDE\nÉGALEMENT CONNU COMME MOUVEMENT DE REVEIL DE LA SAINTETE DANS LE MONDE (HOREMOW)  \n \n\n",

Car c'est la raison pour laquelle Jésus est venu dans ce monde. Jésus a précisé que Dieu cherche des adorateurs et des serviteurs qui le serviront ; dans la justice et la sainteté tous les jours de leur vie.  **\nJean 4 verset 22 à 24   **\n« Vous adorez, vous ne savez pas ce que nous savons ce que nous adorons pour le salut vient des Juifs. Mais l'heure vient; et c'est maintenant que les vrais adorateurs adoreront le Père en esprit et en vérité, car le père cherche de telles personnes pour l'adorer. Dieu est un esprit et ceux qui l'adorent doivent l'adorer en esprit et en vérité.  **\nLe Père cherche de telles personnes qui l'adoreront. Quelles personnes? Ce sont ceux qui l'adoreront en esprit et en vérité. Une autre partie de l'Écriture dit; ceux qui l'adoreront dans la justice et la sainteté. Que l'on sache que la justice et la sainteté disparaissent virtuellement de la terre et de l'église. Et l'Éternel veut récupérer et enrôler des gens qui le serviront dans la justice et la sainteté. La condition de l'église aujourd'hui est que les gens adorent ce qu'ils ne connaissent pas. Ils font tellement de bruit, pourtant ils ne savent pas ce qu'ils font. Ils chantent et applaudissent; à qui chantent-ils et applaudissent-ils? Les Ecritures qu'ils lisent mais ne comprennent pas. Il en est ainsi, parce que le peuple n'a pas compris la justice et la sainteté.\nLes pasteurs ne l'ont pas compris et ne travaillent pas dans la droiture et la sainteté. Ils ne le prêchent pas donc les membres de l'église ne sont pas conscients de la justice et de la sainteté. Il est en train de disparaître rapidement. il est assez difficile pour quelqu'un de voir une grande congrégation ou une assemblée parler de justice et de sainteté. Ils ne parlent que de divertissement et d'autres choses. Les grandes croisades ne sont pas non plus centrées sur la droiture et la sainteté. En effet, ils ne parlent pas de ça mais d'autres sujets. La droiture et la sainteté ont disparu et ne sont plus dans le cœur des gens.\nLe SEIGNEUR appelle les gens, les fait revivre et les ramène au point; où ils serviront l'Éternel dans la justice et la sainteté. Selon la vision de Dieu, la justice est possible. Si ce n'était pas possible, le SEIGNEUR ne nous aurait pas demandé de le faire. Dieu n'est pas un chef de tâche, car la sainteté est possible, sinon, le SEIGNEUR ne nous dirait pas que nous devons être saints.\nCes choses sont possibles et nécessitent la volonté de les faire fonctionner. Dieu veut des gens qui voudront, de même qu'Il dit que si vous voulez, vous mangerez le bon fruit de la terre. Par conséquent, si vous le voulez bien, vous vivrez cette vie de justice. Si toi aussi tu es prêt et préparé, tu entreras dans la sainteté, comme tu vas le voir aujourd'hui. Vous verrez qu'en lisant ce livre, en priant et en croyant, vous serez purifié et marcherez dans la justice. La puissance de Dieu se fera sentir dans votre vie. La présence de Dieu sera dans votre vie et la justice jaillira. La sainteté descendra sur votre vie, amen. Votre cœur et votre pensée seront purifiés ; tous les péchés qui t'ont vaincu; vous les surmonterez parfaitement. C'est ce que Dieu recherche. Bien plus, cette conférence s'adresse aux ouvriers et ministres chrétiens.\nDieu recherche des ouvriers et des ministres qui le serviront dans la justice et la sainteté, mais il y a des ministres qui disent qu'il n'est pas possible d'être juste. Ils disent qu'ils font juste de leur mieux. Il n'est pas possible d'être saint, mais simplement d'essayer d'être saint et ainsi d'avoir communiqué ses membres. Ils ont communiqué cela aux ouvriers sous leurs ordres afin qu'ils fassent ce travail sans la vision de la justice ou la vision de la sainteté.\nLa Bible dit que là où il n'y a pas de vision, le peuple périt. Cependant, là où il n'y a pas de vision de la sainteté, vous ne pouvez pas l'atteindre. Aussi, là où il n'y a pas de vision de justice, vous ne pouvez pas la posséder. Nous élevons la vision de la sainteté et de la justice que vous verrez et posséderez. Que disons-nous alors, qu'en tant que prédicateur, vous prêcherez et serez un homme juste et saint?\nEn tant qu'enseignant, n'allez-vous pas enseigner aux autres, pourtant vous êtes pollué. Vous dites des mensonges parce que vous êtes un menteur qui enseigne aux autres à ne pas commettre d'immoralité pendant que vous en commettez. En parlant d'évangélistes, alors que vous vous promenez d'un endroit à l'autre pour prêcher cet évangile, Dieu exige que vous prêchiez cet évangile dans la justice et la sainteté que votre vie prêche avec vos lèvres. Soyez donc un exemple pour les croyants et pour ceux à qui vous prêchez.\nQue disons-nous donc aux prophètes qui prophétisent toujours ? Ne soyez pas un pécheur donnant ainsi de fausses prophéties, disant des mensonges au nom de l'Éternel. Au contraire, vous prophétiserez et serez une personne juste. Vous prophétiserez dans la justice et ce doit être Dieu qui vous donnera la parole parce que vous ne pouvez pas prononcer la parole de votre propre chef. Dieu doit vous donner la direction pour que vous prophétisiez la vérité. Ce que l'Éternel ne t'a pas dit, tu ne le diras pas. Vous ne direz fidèlement que ce que Jésus vous a dit. Enseignants d'enfants, comme vous vous occupez d'enfants, vous ne devez pas jouer ou plaisanter avec eux. Vous devez prêcher la justice et les enfants doivent le voir dans votre vie. C'est l'attente de Dieu.\nHuissiers, pendant que vous faites ce travail, assurez-vous que vos yeux ne reçoivent ni ne captent le mal de la façon dont une personne s'assoit ou se couche. Assurez-vous de ne pas vous divertir avec le mal ou de collecter des offrandes en tant qu'huissier, vous êtes également occupé à mettre de l'argent dans votre poche. C'est ce à quoi Dieu s'oppose et ce n'est pas la manière de servir Dieu. Nous devons servir Dieu dans la justice.\nPeut-être qu'on vous demande d'acheter quelque chose pour l'église, votre groupe de camarades ou vous devez également garder de l'argent pour votre groupe de camaraderie que vous devez faire dans la justice. Tout ce que vous avez à faire concernant l'œuvre de Dieu, concernant le nom de l'Éternel, vous devez le faire avec justice, que vos mains soient pures et que vous serviez Dieu d'un cœur pur.\nPasteurs comme vous prenez soin des membres de votre église, toutes les jeunes filles, veuves, femmes mariées, ne vous contaminez pas avec eux. Vous ne les convoitez pas. En tant que femmes dans l'église occupées à marcher autour des pasteurs, ne les convoitez pas. Vous planifiez et élaborez des stratégies sur la façon de corrompre les dirigeants. Ce n'est pas ainsi que l'on sert le Dieu vivant.\nLa justice de Dieu est perdue. La sainteté des membres et des prédicateurs de l'évangile est également perdue. C'est pourquoi le SEIGNEUR nous y rappelle parce que\nEn servant Dieu dans la justice et la sainteté sans justice, notre service ne prospérera pas et nous ne prospérerons en rien.\nTravaillez-vous comme électricien, dans les médias électroniques ou quoi que vous fassiez, vous devriez le faire avec joie et bonheur. Vous devez chercher plus d'opportunités pour faire le travail afin de le servir dans la justice et la sainteté, tous les jours de notre vie.  **\nEn tant que ministres et ouvriers chrétiens, ils doivent se réunir et se relier au service de Dieu en faisant une chose ou l'autre. Dieu s'attend à ce que nous le fassions dans la justice et la sainteté, sans rancune ni amertume dans notre cœur. L'orgueil dans nos vies, la division dans notre cœur et les murmures sont les choses que Dieu ne veut pas. Le Dieu de justice, Créateur de nos vies et SEIGNEUR de l'Église n'en veut pas. Son but est qu'il nous sauve pour que nous le servions dans la justice et la sainteté tous les jours de notre vie. Lorsque vous ne parvenez pas à vivre dans la droiture tous les jours, que ce soit le matin ou le soir, vous devenez troublé.\nDieu a planté le soleil dans le ciel et il a brillé chaque jour sans cesse. Il brille tous les jours. Tout ce que fait l'Éternel est pour toujours. Son but est de vous permettre d'accepter la justice et la sainteté tous les jours de votre vie. Et l'Éternel te rendra la justice et la sainteté et t'affermira dans l'œuvre sainte. Vous travaillerez avec lui pour toujours et à jamais au nom de Jésus . Amen.\nLa Bible dit que vous devriez partir ; sortez du milieu d'eux et soyez purs, vous qui portez le vase de l'Éternel.\nComment Dieu peut-il dire qu'il opèrera un nouveau réveil dans le monde à travers vous alors que vous n'êtes pas pur et que vous n'avez pas obtenu sa justice. \nComment Dieu peut-il vous inscrire comme l'un des ministres de la fin des temps alors que votre vie est en désordre ? Vous n'êtes pas qualifié et avez donc besoin d'aide. Les gens autour de vous vous crient dessus que vous n'êtes pas qualifié, alors, comment Dieu peut-il faire de vous le ministre de la fin des temps ? Comment peut-il? C'est pour cette raison qu'il dit non. Ça ne peut pas être. Vous devez vous rendre pur et juste et c'est alors que vous rejoindrez l'armée de cette fin des temps.  **\nLa Bible dit que la fondation de Dieu est sûre d'avoir ce sceau; l'Éternel connaît ceux qui sont à lui, et que celui qui nomme le nom de Christ se détourne de l'iniquité. C'est parce que dans une grande maison, il n'y a pas seulement des vases d'or et d'argent, mais aussi des laines et celui qui s'en purifie sera utilisé comme vase d'honneur, purifié par le maître et propre à l'usage du maître. Notre prière est que le Dieu de la sainteté, de la justice, de la purification, de la sanctification, de la transformation et de la perfection fasse le travail spécial aujourd'hui afin que les gens soient purifiés, sanctifiés, perfectionnés et servent notre Dieu, dans la justice et la sainteté chaque jour de notre vie. . La justice et la sainteté devant les hommes.\nDieu parle sincèrement à votre cœur ; par conséquent, prenez cette affaire au sérieux. Inconsciemment, vous avez servi Dieu, sans direction ni vision, et vous n'avez pas compris le sens de la mort de Christ. Vous ne comprenez pas le sens des Écritures et la pure parole de Dieu. Il est possible que vous ayez un milieu chrétien pauvre, où on vous a enseigné qu'il n'y a pas de justice et que personne ne peut être saint ou parfait et que vous avez accepté. Votre cœur n'a pas encore saisi pleinement le message, d'où l'accent mis.\nPeut-être avez-vous lu l'Ecriture sans comprendre mais maintenant, nous vous ouvrons les yeux. Ouvrez vos yeux pour voir les choses que la justice attend de vous parmi les hommes. Considérons donc la différence entre ces deux mots   Sainteté et Justice     **\n \n2 Corinthiens 5 verset 21   **\n« Car il l'a fait devenir péché pour nous, lui qui n'a pas connu le péché ; afin que nous devenions justice de Dieu en lui.\"  **\nLa droiture a deux sens   Le premier sens est l'acceptation. La personne reçoit de Dieu parce qu'elle est jointe à Jésus ou unie à Jésus. C'est une acceptation qu'une personne reçoit de Dieu parce qu'elle croit en Jésus. Il a accepté Jésus, même si Dieu donne à cette personne la justice. Il est rendu juste. C'est comme si un homme vous acceptant comme son fils, vous traite favorablement parce que vous êtes un ami de son fils ou de sa fille. Parce que vous aimez sa fille et que vous vous associez à lui, il décide alors de vous aimer, d'accepter et donc de vous traiter favorablement comme il traite son fils qui est droiture.\nComme vous êtes unis à Jésus et que vous L'avez accepté ; vous avez cru en Jésus, Dieu a déclaré votre justice. Donnez une offrande et réjouissez-vous. Vous êtes acceptable en Lui. Maintenant, vous avez la faveur et la justice en Dieu par Christ.  **\n \n \n \nCHAPITRE DEUX   **\nQu'est-ce que la Sainteté ?  **\nLa sainteté est la vie du juste qu'il vit sans commettre de péché. Encore une fois, c'est comme si l'homme qui vous a créé, vous a accepté à cause de son fils ou de sa fille. La sainteté, c'est obéir aux consignes et aux règles de l'homme sans faillir. C'est la sainteté. Vous êtes rendu juste, et alors vous devez aussi être saint, pour plaire à cet homme. Pour obtenir le meilleur de cet homme, vous devez obéir à ses instructions et à ses directives afin de voir la droiture et la sainteté et d'être différent.\nLa droiture est votre acceptation tandis que la sainteté est votre style de vie. Cependant, certains voient la justice et la sainteté comme signifiant la même chose. Si vous êtes juste, que vous vous comportez bien et que vous faites ce que son fils vous demande de faire en suivant l'exemple de son fils, c'est la sainteté en soi. Par conséquent, à cet égard, la justice et la sainteté vont de pair. Alors qu'est-ce que cela signifie?\nSimplement que vous servez Dieu dans la justice et la sainteté tous les jours de votre vie. Cela signifie également que dans votre service à Dieu, vous n'avez pas le temps de vous désengager de Jésus. A chaque instant et chaque jour de votre vie, vous êtes toujours en connexion avec Jésus. Il n'y aura ni temps ni jour pour se désengager de Jésus. C'est encore servir Dieu dans la justice tous les jours de votre vie. Ensuite, servir Dieu dans la Sainteté tous les jours de votre vie signifie votre service à Dieu. Assurez-vous d'obéir à toute la parole de Dieu et de ne pas enfreindre son commandement. Il n'y aura pas d'autre repos que de garder Sa parole quotidiennement.\nVous devez obéir à sa parole et maintenir sa norme chaque jour. Ensuite, vous servirez Dieu dans la sainteté tous les jours de votre vie. Est-ce possible? Oui.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 2 verset 10   **\n\"Vous êtes témoins, et Dieu aussi, de la sainteté, de la justice et de l'irréprochabilité que nous nous sommes comportés parmi vous qui avez cru.\"  **\nQu'il soit clair pour tous les chrétiens, pasteurs et dirigeants que la sainteté est possible, mais que vous avez déçu Dieu à cause des mensonges. En tant que leader chrétien, vous dites des mensonges, trichez et avez une colère terrible dans votre vie. C'est une déception. Vous êtes un leader chrétien mais un homme méchant et mauvais ; le péché et le mal vous ont fait tomber de sa norme. Les dirigeants chrétiens de la vérité ne devraient pas être mauvais mais servir Dieu dans la justice et la sainteté.\nComme Paul le dit, non seulement moi, mais en tant que ministres du mouvement de réveil de la sainteté, ne commettons pas de péché. Si vous commettez un péché en tant que coordinateur d'état, vous êtes un pécheur. Ne pensez donc pas que les autres seront comme vous. Non. Si vous commettez un péché en tant qu'épouse d'un pasteur ou d'un coordinateur, ne pensez pas que les autres femmes sont comme vous. Il y a des gens qui servent Dieu et Son histoire le montre. Le Seigneur sait que vous êtes le vaisseau de Dieu dans ce mouvement et Il vous mettra en pratique avec des promesses de grande récompense en raison de votre engagement envers la sainteté et la justice.\nOui, cette écriture est accomplie dans votre vie. Je dis sainteté et justice devant les hommes, c'est ce qu'il a dit. Paul a dit que vous êtes des témoins parce que j'ai vécu ma vie avant vous. Par conséquent, lorsque les gens se plaignent de vous, assurez-vous de savoir s'ils sont vrais ou non. Il se peut que quelqu'un ait dit au pasteur qu'il mentait, et vous avez réagi en disant que vous vivez par la grâce de Dieu. La grâce de Dieu est-elle de mentir ? Non. Allons-nous continuer à mentir que la grâce de Dieu sera là ? Les gens ne devraient pas se plaindre de vous.\nLa Bible dit que si vous choisissez un évêque, il devrait être quelqu'un qui n'apportera pas de reproche. S'il n'a pas un mauvais rapport des gentils et des pécheurs, il devrait alors être complètement juste. L'Église ne doit donc pas se plaindre de vous. Vous devriez être juste et saint, mais s'il y a une plainte, qu'elle ne soit pas soutenue car elle ne sera pas vraie.\nQu'aucune femme ne se lève pour dire que ce pasteur a voulu ou commis une immoralité avec moi.\nLorsque cela se produira, ils demanderont aux gens de ne pas la prendre au sérieux et de ne pas en parler. Ne vous inquiétez pas car nous serons bordés. Tout ce qui l'a poussée à s'ouvrir en disant ces choses sur vous doit être pris au sérieux. En effet, nous allons border et des enquêtes appropriées seront faites.\nÉcoutez, Dieu est fatigué des faux prédicateurs et Il lève une nouvelle équipe de prédicateurs ; n'apportez pas la vieille chose dans cet endroit. La Bible dit que vous ne pouvez pas verser un vin nouveau dans une vieille outre de vin car cela aura un problème. Apporterez-vous ce merveilleux mouvement et le construirez-vous sur le vieux prophète ? Non. Vous devez être juste et saint dans votre vie.\nEt les femmes, soyez justes et parfaites. De plus, en tant qu'épouse, vous ne devez pas être double langue. Vérifiez et contrôlez votre bouche. Ne soyez pas un corps occupé. Ce sont les Ecritures. Dieu recherche la justice tout comme nous. Il veut des gens justes et saints qui le serviront chaque jour, alors il y aura la paix et la joie dans le cœur de Dieu.\nLe monde l'a déçu parce qu'il y a des gens formidables qui n'ont pas de vie en eux.  **\nActes 23 verset 1   **\n\"Et Paul, regardant attentivement le conseil, dit  Hommes et frères, j'ai vécu en toute bonne conscience devant Dieu jusqu'à ce jour.\"  **\nCe dont il est question, c'est de la conscience non seulement devant Dieu mais devant les hommes car il faut avoir un bon rapport sur vous.  **\nDeuxième Rois 4 verset 8 à 9 dit   **\n«Et il arriva un jour qu'Elisée passa à Shumen, où se trouvait une grande femme; et elle le contraignit à manger du pain. Et c'est ainsi qu'il est passé; il s'y est rendu pour manger du pain. Verset 9. Et elle dit à son mari   Voici , je vois que c'est un saint homme de Dieu, qui passe continuellement près de nous.  **\nPouvez-vous voir que le rapport est des hommes? Elisée n'était pas là et la femme a observé Elisée non seulement pendant une journée. La Bible dit que vous les reconnaîtrez à leurs fruits, mais un arbre ne porte pas de fruits tous les jours. La femme a eu suffisamment de temps pour examiner la vie d'Elisée, mais elle l'a attiré plus près. S'il était du genre convoitise et avide à la recherche d'argent, la femme l'aurait su. C'était une grande femme dans cette ville.\nAprès avoir observé Elisée pendant une période de temps raisonnable, elle a dit à son mari que l'homme était un saint homme de Dieu. C'est le type de rapport qu'on attend de vous et des gens pour donner ce type de rapport sur vous. Les personnes qui vous regardent devraient nous dire qui vous êtes.\nMême ceux qui relèvent de votre ministère devraient nous en dire plus sur vous. Ne permettez pas aux gens de dire pasteur; nous ne vous comprenons plus et ne discutons pas de ce genre de choses ici. Que les personnes qui travaillent avec vous de très près nous disent qui vous êtes et rapportent que l'homme ou la femme est saint.\nOn s'attend à ce que le rapport vienne du peuple, après qu'ils aient examiné Jésus même dans la douleur. La croix avec toute la douleur, les mauvais traitements après quelques heures d'examen de Jésus ; toutes les moqueries des gens à son égard, sa réaction au rire du voleur sur la croix et sa compassion pour la croix. Après tout examen, dit le centurion, assurément cet homme est innocent ; Il est le fils de Dieu.\nAprès l'accusation, l'oppression du peuple, peut-être traversez-vous des difficultés.\nVous ont-ils défié ou menti après que tous les autres aient observé vos réactions. Ils surveillent votre attitude afin de vous provoquer à la colère, laissez-les venir dire que cette femme est sainte. Nous avons besoin de ce témoignage des gens et pas seulement de vous mais de la bouche de deux ou trois témoins chaque affaire est établie.\nQu'on leur dise qu'après qu'ils vous aient observé, qu'ils veuillent que votre mari même s'il est du genre intimidateur ou qu'il vous ait intimidé, abusé ou craché sur vous et qu'il ait tout fait après quelques jours, semaines et peut-être même des mois, il devrait expliquer qui vous êtes . Le rapport indiquera si vous êtes juste parce que ces choses doivent vous prouver. La lumière brille le plus lorsqu'il fait plus sombre, lorsque les choses sont difficiles, nous voulons voir comment vous réagissez.\nQue diront les gens de votre réaction et de votre attitude ? Nous voulons que votre femme nous dise qui vous êtes. Qui est réellement le mari ? Votre mari est-il juste ? Votre mari connaît-il Jésus ?\nLa position donnée à votre mari, est-elle donnée à tort ? Cette revendication de ministère que votre mari dit qu'il va commencer ; se qualifie-t-il selon votre évaluation ? C'est ce que nous recherchons dans la justice et la sainteté devant les hommes. Les gens nous ont fait rapport sur vous.  **\nPremier Pierre 2 verset 12   **\n« Ayez une conversation honnête parmi les Gentils, afin qu'alors qu'ils parlent contre vous comme des malfaisants, ils puissent par vos bonnes œuvres, qu'ils verront, glorifier Dieu au jour de la visitation.    **\nC'est ce que nous désirons, qu'ils disent du mal de toi, mais changent plus tard et disent que cet homme est un homme juste. Maintenant que votre femme vous accuse de justice et que vous êtes audacieux, tendant votre visage pour la vaincre, savez-vous que votre femme est une messagère de Dieu ? C'est pour vous évaluer pendant que vous êtes encore en vie, afin que vous ne gaspilliez pas votre énergie et votre force. Cherche-t-elle plutôt à vous faire du mal ? Non. Vous savez que la femme a raison et votre conscience le confirmera. Si elle a raison, alors calmez-vous et résolvez le problème car la Bible dit que l'obéissance vaut mieux que le sacrifice. Humiliez-vous devant elle et revenez à la norme du christianisme comme l'exige Dieu.\nEt votre christianisme, c'est parce que votre mari a utilisé tous ses pouvoirs contre vous et a échoué que vous n'y allez pas à cause de la justice mais parce qu'il vous persécute. Non, ce sont de vraies affaires qui ne sont pas réglées et qui n'ont même pas le temps de régler, mais qui sont occupées à dire que je suis ministre. Bien sûr, ce n'est pas le type de ministre que nous recherchons. Ce n'est pas le type de ministre qui devrait rejoindre ce Mouvement. Non.\nRéglez cette affaire. Pourquoi êtes-vous plus intéressé à prêcher et à devenir général \nSurveillant que d'aller au paradis? Votre intérêt réside plus dans le maintien de la position que dans le fait d'aller au paradis et c'est tout le bruit autour de vous. Frère, purifiez-vous, vous qui êtes irrésolu, nettoyez-vous, atteignez le niveau que les gens peuvent maintenant dire, oui, il est qualifié pour être notre chef. Il n'est pas une pierre d'achoppement, mais une incarnation de la justice et de la sainteté devant les hommes.\nJustice et sainteté devant Dieu Certains d'entre nous ont beaucoup de chance et ont la faveur des hommes. Nous pouvons si bien rire, être doux devant eux, gentils et les gens disent que nous sommes merveilleux, grands et qu'il n'y a pas de chrétien comme nous. Nous vous conduisons des hommes à Dieu que vous ne pouvez ni tromper ni railler mais qui est parfait, léger; laissez cette lumière briller sur vous.\nLaissez cette lumière exposer votre cœur à Dieu dont les yeux voient plus que les yeux de l'aigle. Il voit dans les ténèbres, l'intimité et dans la pensée de l'imagination de nos cœurs. Quand Nebucadnetsar parlait, qui était là pour l'entendre ? Dieu l'a entendu du ciel.\nLa pensée de son cœur est montée au Ciel et Dieu l'a vu et a réagi. Dieu n'est pas comme l'homme ni comme le fils de l'homme. Laissez-nous vous conduire à lui.\nNous parlons de justice et de sainteté devant Dieu.  **\nLuc 1 verset 74 à 75   **\n\"Qu'il nous accorde que nous, étant délivrés de la main de nos ennemis, puissions le servir sans crainte. Dans la sainteté et la justice devant lui, tous les jours de notre vie.\"  **\nPar conséquent, la sainteté dont nous parlons est devant lui.  **\nRegarde cette histoire    **\nUn des jours, nous étions dans ma maison, peut-être le jour où ils ont bombardé « Nyanya » ( un État du Nigeria), mon chauffeur a dit qu'il ne connaissait pas ou ne comprenait pas la patience de Dieu ; pour lui, il aurait dû détruire ces gens. J'ai ri, parce que quand je l'ai regardé, je me suis demandé ce que c'était que de penser à la meilleure façon de le gérer. Non pas que j'ai trop ri, mais juste souri dans mon cœur. Environ deux semaines ou plus tard, nous étions à « Gombe » ( un endroit au Nigeria) pour un programme ; Angel Gabriel a rendu visite à ma femme et parmi d'autres révélations, il a dit que votre mari avait fait une chose dont Dieu était très mécontent. Ce qui s'est passé? Lorsque le conducteur parlait, il y voyait un discours insensé. Dieu a confiance en lui, parce que ses yeux sont sur lui ; comment alors pouvait-il rire d'une telle affaire. J'ai eu le choc de ma vie. Vous pouvez voir le jugement de Dieu et la justice dont il parle. Je ne veux pas l'offenser en un point comme je l'ai fait. Alors l'ange a dit Eh bien, Dieu n'est pas comme un homme dans Son jugement. Dieu a vu dans son cœur qu'il prévoyait de lui parler plus tard, cela a poussé Dieu à lui pardonner. Par conséquent, papa Rika a été pardonné. Amen.\nDu côté de Dieu, comment aurais-je pu apparaître devant le ciel et savoir que j'ai péché ?\nC'est ce que cela signifie, du côté de Dieu mais, il est possible de vivre saintement tous les jours de votre vie. C'est ce que Dieu nous dit et révèle ces choses.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 2 verset 10     **\n\"Vous êtes témoins et Dieu aussi, combien nous nous sommes comportés saints, justes et irréprochables parmi vous qui croyez  \"  **\nNon seulement vous êtes des témoins, mais Dieu aussi. Frère et sœur, terminons l'affaire. Élevons notre sainteté au niveau de l'approbation de Dieu, et disons que vous êtes juste et saint. Il a approuvé Daniel, Job, Noé, Enoch et leur justice. Il l'a déclaré; laissez Dieu vous déclarer juste et saint. Laisse Dieu dire que tu as considéré mon serviteur Job. Malgré les problèmes, les persécutions et les attaques, il garde son intégrité. Que Dieu le dise de vous, il est possible de vivre cette vie.  **\nActes 24 verset 16   **\n\"Et c'est en cela que je m'exerce à avoir toujours une conscience sans offense envers Dieu et envers les hommes.\"  **\nPrenez ces choses comme un devoir et ne jouez pas quand les gens vous accusent. Ne riez pas lorsque des personnes ou des membres de votre famille vous accusent. S'il s'agit de persécution, vérifiez bien cela et laissez Dieu et ceux qui vous entourent l'approuver. Laissez Dieu témoigner dans votre cœur que c'est de la persécution. Sinon; ne prenez pas l'accusation à la légère car vous jouez peut-être avec votre vie. Ne savez-vous pas que ce travail doit être fait sans tache ou que Jésus-Christ est mort pour l'église ; qu'Il puisse l'obtenir sans tache ni ride et quoi que ce soit de ce genre ?\nIl n'y aura aucune tache qui est la norme. Tout ce qui est tache n'entrera jamais au ciel ni tout ce qui est souillé. Si vous êtes occupé à penser que vous pouvez aller au Ciel avec votre souillure, vous n'y serez jamais. Parfaits, soyez parfaits, comme votre père qui est aux cieux est parfait. Prenez la vie chrétienne comme une entreprise. Paul dit ici que je m'exerce à en faire une pratique, un plan et une détermination. Faites-en un objectif de cœur et un devoir de vivre sans tache.\nFaites-en un plan que lorsque je me réveillerai tous les jours, je ne pécherai pas. Si je dois confronter quelqu'un et que je connais le rapport à faire et que j'ai peur de dire des mensonges, alors s'il vous plaît, sortez de là. Amenez l'affaire devant Dieu pour qu'elle soit réglée maintenant et obtenez toute la sagesse nécessaire avant de rencontrer cette personne comme prévu, mais ne péchez pas. Planifiez-le de telle manière que vous ne péchiez pas.\nJohn l'avait prévu mais il avait une femme terrible. Il s'est exercé, en présence de sa terrible épouse qu'il ne péchera jamais. La femme l'attrapa par les cheveux et le traîna. Il aurait pu la renverser mais ne fera rien qui ressemble au péché parce qu'il prêche la sainteté et en tant que tel sera saint. C'était une épreuve pour la doctrine de la sainteté de montrer à l'être humain si cette sainteté est vraie, de s'y tenir et de ne jamais échouer. C'est ainsi que vous devriez le prendre dans la vie, vous tenir devant Dieu avec une conscience pure.  **\n2 Corinthiens 1 verset 12   **\n\"Car notre joie est ceci, le témoignage de notre conscience, que dans la simplicité et la sincérité divine, non avec la sagesse charnelle, mais par la grâce de Dieu, nous avons eu notre conversation dans le monde, et plus abondamment avec vous.\"  **\nLe témoignage de notre conscience est que nous ne faisons pas ces choses pour un gain personnel.\nL'argent ne fait pas partie de ce que nous faisons, et il n'y a pas d'autre gain. Que cherchons-nous? Que voulons-nous? C'est le témoignage de notre conscience que nous avons calculé certaines choses à vous dire pour une raison quelconque. Non, dans la simplicité et la sincérité divine, nous faisons de notre mieux comme nous savons le faire. De notre meilleure prédication à toute sincérité. Nous avons notre conversation dans le monde parmi les pécheurs, très prudents.\nComme nous sommes entrés dans les bus ou rejoindre le taxi; aller au marché, dans la rue ou où que nous soyons dans le monde, soyez très prudent dans notre comportement car nous sommes sous caméra. La caméra divine est sur nous, et nous ne voulons pas que Dieu nous trouve avec des défauts.\nDieu merci, il est fidèle et vous dira s'il vous reproche parce qu'il ne cherche pas comment vous détruire. Son but est de vous sauver car ce n'est pas encore le moment de la destruction. C'est le temps du salut. Vous avez peut-être péché mais ne vous limitez pas, Il vous le dira et ne vous le cachera pas.\nC'est donc ce que dit Paul. Nous avons eu notre conversation dans le monde, et plus abondamment à ta parole. Nous vous avons prêché et quel péché avez-vous vu dans nos vies ?\nQuel mal as-tu vu ? Dire des mensonges, tricher, être impliqué dans l'immoralité et chercher de l'argent ? Ce que vous avez vu, c'est comment nous vivons à la fois en privé, en public, du côté des hommes et de Dieu.  **\n2 Corinthiens 2 verset 17   **\n« Car nous ne sommes pas aussi nombreux à corrompre la parole de Dieu ; mais comme sincérité, mais comme de Dieu, devant Dieu, nous parlons en Christ.  **\nVous n'êtes pas ici pour la prophétie, mais s'il y a une ou une révélation, elle viendra et s'il ne donne pas, nous n'en forcerons pas une. Nous ne dirons pas de mensonges. C'est le témoignage de notre conscience, et nous ne sommes pas si nombreux, qui corrompent la parole de Dieu pour un gain et un intérêt personnels. Nous ne sommes pas de ces personnes mais, nous prêchons la sincérité en tant que personnes et prédicateurs ordonnés pour conduire les gens au Ciel.\nLe Seigneur nous dit toujours que ce mouvement est Son mouvement et non pour un homme.\nC'est le MOUVEMENT DE REVEIL DE LA SAINTETE et le SEIGNEUR le défend aujourd'hui d'une autre manière qui est   Qui est la sainteté ? Dieu fait revivre les gens et il se déplace dans le monde entier. C'est le nom de Dieu et son œuvre. Dieu est sainteté; Il est celui qui fait revivre le peuple et le fait dans le monde entier. Le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté n'est pas un travail individuel ou personnel.\nPar conséquent, pourquoi corrompez-vous ce travail ? Il nous donne le message à prêcher et la connaissance intérieure. Jusqu'à ce que nous soyons sortis, nous avons vraiment vu que l'œil de Dieu est dans ce mouvement. Vous verrez des gens que nous sommes les seuls à faire paître dans le monde. Le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté est celui qui les soutient. Partout à travers cet internet, ils sont connectés.\nQuelqu'un aux Comores, dans les Caraïbes et autour de la Jamaïque dit que le pasteur Rika est notre pasteur. Ils s'assoient devant leurs propres ordinateurs, regardent Internet, écoutent et se changent, se purifient, se sanctifient, traversent la persécution et avancent.\nPar conséquent, Dieu fait revivre le monde et avance, afin que cette parole dont vous vous souciez ne soit pas une parole contaminée. C'est pourquoi si quelqu'un dit qu'il a vu la révélation, ce n'est pas ce que nous recherchons, mais la parole de Dieu. La révélation doit s'accorder avec la parole de Dieu, et Il a accordé la compréhension.  **\nNous ne sommes pas des enfants; nous connaissons la pensée de Dieu. C'est un travail diligent que nous faisons; nous ne devrions pas simplement courir après la révélation. La révélation doit être comparée aux Écritures pour savoir si elle est de Dieu, si alors nous la recevons pour une édification. Dieu nous l'a envoyé et nous ne sommes pas divisés. **\n(1)\tCroyez ceci, ce qui s'est passé quand quelqu'un a dit ceci ou cela.\n(2)\tCroyez celui-ci, qu'a-t-il dit? Ceci ou cela causant de la confusion ? Pouvez-vous le retracer dans la Bible ? Certaines personnes peuvent dire que si un homme fait l'amour avec sa femme, il ne devrait pas être dans cette position. Jésus dit que s'ils sont dans cette position , c'est mal et contre Dieu. Peut-être avez-vous entendu cela. Le nôtre est ce que dit la Bible? La Bible dit-elle ces choses ? Si une femme est comme ça, cela montre qu'elle n'est pas soumise à son mari. Est-ce le sujet dont parle la Bible ou dans le caractère ou le comportement et le style de vie ? je parle en proverbe; que celui qui a des oreilles pour entendre entende ce que je dis.  **\nJustice et sainteté devant Dieu. Vous devez être juste et maintenir la droiture dans votre conscience. Quoi que vous prêchiez, vérifiez si vous prêchez bien. Vérifiez les histoires que vous racontez. Vérifiez le terrain et le bâtiment que vous achetez pour vous assurer que vous n'êtes pas en conflit avec une autre personne. Deux groupes d'Églises ou dénominations négocient pour acheter des terres et l'une court rapidement pour payer, collectant ainsi la terre au détriment de l'autre tout en prêchant Jésus. Et vous dites que vous êtes Saint pour prêcher ce même Jésus. Jésus est-il divisé ? Non.\nPuisque ces gens sont aussi des enfants de Dieu et sont venus devant Dieu, pourquoi n'abandonnez-vous pas ? Cela montre que l'église n'est pas pour lui mais pour vous et non pour Jésus.\nSinon, si Jésus avait envoyé un peuple là-bas, vous ne lutteriez pas pour vaincre Jésus parmi ces gens. Vérifiez le travail que vous faites, le témoignage que vous donnez pour collecter de l'argent, ces méthodes et les prophéties que vous utilisez. Ainsi parle le Seigneur, ou que le Seigneur m'a révélé que vous causez de la confusion, en vous rapprochant de l'homme de Dieu, alors que vous n'êtes pas un homme de Dieu mais que vous obtenez juste une couverture.\nLes gens devraient savoir que vous êtes un grand homme parce que ; vous vous êtes identifié à des gens formidables. Esprit corrompu, Dieu vous connaît ; enlevez ces choses de votre vie et servons Dieu dans la justice et la sainteté.  ** \n \n \nCHAPITRE TROIS   **\nSainteté et droiture dans la vie quotidienne et le service   **\nLa sainteté et la droiture dans la vie quotidienne peuvent être atteintes par une saine vie de dévotion, la méditation de la parole de Dieu et l'engagement dans la prière personnelle. Jean 15 verset 3 \"Maintenant vous êtes purs par la parole que je vous ai dite.\"\nMaintenant, je t'ai dit quelques mots et ces mots t'ont purifié. Avec quoi un jeune homme purifiera-t-il sa voie sinon en la prenant selon ta parole. J'ai caché ta parole dans mon cœur afin de ne pas pécher contre toi. Sans lire cette parole, prêter attention à la Bible, méditer la parole, la sainteté est impossible. Vous ne lisez pas la Bible ; ni étudier la Bible, mais vivre comme ça, le péché prendra le dessus. La poussière couvrira votre maison, votre chambre et partout avec des morceaux de papier ici et là. Pourquoi? Vous ne balayez pas cette pièce. Vous ne balayez pas constamment cette pièce.\nMaintenant vous êtes pur en entendant et en étudiant ce mot, en lisant les livres de la littérature chrétienne inspirée, en les obtenant, en les mangeant afin qu'ils élaborent la propreté pour votre vie. La Bible dit que vous pourriez être sanctifiés et purifiés par le lavage d'eau par la parole. Sanctifie-les parce que ta parole est vraie. Et si vous n'avez rien à voir avec ce mot, comment saurez-vous vos erreurs ? La Bible dit que vous mettez en pratique la parole et non des auditeurs en vous trompant seulement vous-même. Celui qui écoute la parole et non celui qui l'exécute, le même est comme un homme qui est lui-même dans un miroir. Cela signifie que la lecture du mot vous fait vous voir tel que vous êtes réellement.\nLes choses qui sont dans votre vie, les faiblesses, la façon dont vous avez mal tourné, l'imagination de votre pensée qui est fausse, vous verrez la tentation dans un lointain lointain.  **\n  \nGrâce à l'étude de la parole, vous pourrez alors aller à Dieu et vous en débarrasser. Vous pourrez vous décider et dire non, cela ne m'arrivera pas. Ok, c'est ce que Satan planifie contre moi ; Non, il ne travaillera pas. C'est ainsi que vous pouvez aider votre âme.\nMais alors vous n'étudiez pas les Écritures; vous ne lisez pas la Bible. Les prédicateurs qui ne lisent pas les Écritures mais lisent seulement pour chercher un message ; ne peut pas supporter. Vous n'êtes ni fort, ni juste ; des mensonges sont sur vos lèvres, alors pourquoi ne venez-vous pas à cette Ecriture pour la lire. Même lorsqu'une mission vous est donnée de lire le Nouveau Testament et de le terminer, vous ne lisez pas votre Bible.\nPrière \nLa Bible dit que tu dois tout demander au père en mon nom et il te donnera. Demandez et recevez que votre joie soit parfaite. Demandez et l'on vous donnera, cherchez et vous trouverez, frappez et l'on vous ouvrira. Celui qui demande reçoit, celui qui cherche trouve et à celui qui frappe on ouvrira lequel de vous ; si son fils lui demande du pain lui donnera-t-il une pierre ? S'il demande du poisson, lui donnera-t-il un serpent ? Si donc tu es mauvais, tu sais donner de bons cadeaux à tes enfants, combien plus ton père qui est aux cieux qui donne de bons cadeaux à ceux qui le lui demandent.\nJe connais la pensée | pensez à vous, des pensées de paix et non de mal, pour vous donner la fin attendue, alors vous m'invoquerez qui vous irez me prier et je vous exaucerai, vous me chercherez et me trouverez quand vous cherche-moi de tout ton coeur et je serai trouvé par toi, dit l'Éternel, et je te détournerai de ta captivité.\nPriez et apportez chaque péché devant Dieu. Ceux que je ne vois pas, enseignez-moi si j'ai commis l'iniquité et je ne ferai plus. Apportez-le à Dieu dans la prière ; Il ôtera tout péché de votre vie. Il dit qu'il le fera. Prenez-vous le temps de prier ? Avez-vous pris le temps de prier pour cette situation ? Au cours de cette luxure qui dérange votre cœur? La convoitise dans ton cœur, battant ton cœur, traînant ta vie ; avez-vous pris le temps de prier ? Frappez violemment à la porte et demandez à Dieu de vous délivrer.\nAie pitié de moi, ô Dieu, lave-moi, purifie-moi avec de l'hysope et je serai propre. Oh, j'ai encore dit des mensonges, oh Seigneur, délivre-moi et je ferai la restitution de ce mensonge maintenant. Avez-vous pris le temps de prier pour vous purifier ? Aussi, avez-vous pris le temps de prier pour elle et lui parce que cette personne veille toujours sur mes péchés, donc tempérez-vous avec sa vie ? Avez-vous amené cette personne à Dieu dans la prière ?\nLa prière vous gardera, vous purifiera, purifiera votre vie et vous fortifiera. Invoquez-moi et je vous écouterai et vous montrerai des choses grandes et puissantes que vous ne savez pas. Invoquez-moi dans les jours de détresse et je vous délivrerai et mon nom sera glorifié. Quand il y a un plaisir à commettre le péché, appelez Dieu, Il vous délivrera et vous serez si reconnaissant et heureux de glorifier Son nom. Par conséquent, améliorez et augmentez votre vie de dévotion, votre prière personnelle et votre engagement.\nVous qui êtes des leaders, quand vous envoyez des membres de votre église prier et que vous ne les rejoignez pas mais que vous prenez le plaisir de dormir, vous vous occupez de vous-même. Tout ce qu'un homme sème, il le récoltera. Toutes les tensions qui sont dans votre corps deviennent raides et vous ne pouvez pas exercer votre corps mais rejetez plutôt la prière. Mais j'ai envie de prier depuis plus d'un mois maintenant.\nVous ne faites rien à ce sujet. Quand commencerez-vous à avoir envie de prier ? Rassemblez-vous et rejoignez ces personnes qui prient. Si vous ne savez même pas quoi prier, alors criez le nom de Jésus. La puissance de Dieu viendra vous perdre et l'esprit de prière prendra le dessus sur votre vie. Vous le faites pour continuer votre vie.  **\nDiscipline personnelle   **\nSi vous voulez être un saint homme; aux yeux de Dieu, alors la discipline personnelle est requise.  **            \n1 Corinthiens 9 verset 24 à 27   **\n« Ne savez -vous pas que ceux qui courent dans une course courent tous, mais un seul reçoit le prix. Courez donc, afin que vous puissiez obtenir. Et tout homme qui lutte pour la maîtrise est tempéré en toutes choses, maintenant ils le font pour obtenir une couronne corruptible ; mais nous sommes incorruptibles. Je cours donc ainsi, pas aussi incertain, donc je combats, pas comme quelqu'un qui bat l'air.    **\nMais je garde sous mon corps et je le soumets à la soumission, de peur qu'après avoir prêché aux autres, je ne sois moi-même un naufragé.\nJe suppose que la raison en est que la possibilité que vous alliez en enfer est très élevée, n'êtes-vous pas au courant de cela. C'est pourquoi vous êtes assis sans rien faire. Vous ne luttez pas, mais vous prenez plus de temps pour dormir, vous cherchez plus de temps pour regarder la télévision. De plus, vous passez plus de temps sur Internet, en faisant autre chose sur le marché. Vous préférez vous asseoir entre amis et la Bible est laissée sans surveillance.\nIl n'y a pas de vie de prière car il n'y a pas de temps pour cela mais vous avez passé tout votre temps à voyager, car vous ne savez pas que la possibilité d'aller en enfer est très élevée. Paul le savait donc il a fait quelque chose de pratique avec son corps en le maîtrisant. Parfois, cette prédication chrétienne ne prêche pas trop que Jésus se perde. Vous pouvez même vous souvenir de lui à nouveau, même si tout ce dont vous vous souvenez est la prédication, n'en arrivez pas à ce point.\nQu'est-ce que cela profitera à un homme s'il gagne le monde entier et perd sa propre âme ? Votre âme est vitale. Venez quand vous alliez n'avez-vous pas vu des cheveux blancs qui étaient ici et là dans votre vie ? Lorsque vous montiez et descendiez, n'avez-vous pas remarqué un bruit troublant votre conscience ?\nN'est-ce pas suffisant pour que vous créiez du temps, que vous nettoyiez cette chose et que vous vous contentiez de votre vie ? Vous ne recevez pas le signal ? Paul a dit qu'il s'était fait quelque chose pour s'assurer que ce paradis ne soit pas manqué. Allez faire quelque chose dans votre vie. Faites quelque chose pour vous. Prenez mesure que ce paradis ne vous manquera pas.\nQuiconque vous provoque, fortifiez-vous maintenant et dites que je ne me soucierai plus de la provocation parce que je ne veux pas manquer le paradis ? Discipline et étude pour te faire approuver devant Dieu, un ouvrier qui n'avait pas besoin d'avoir honte de partager correctement la parole de Dieu.\nQu'il ne soit pas mentionné une seule fois qu'en tant que leader, vous commettez l'immoralité. Mais la fornication et la convoitise ne le mentionnent pas une seule fois parmi vous. Ne l'essayez pas pour ne pas échouer. Dans cet endroit où vous travaillez, qu'ils ne vous trouvent pas fautif. C'est ainsi que Daniel a vécu sa vie avant même que Jésus ne vienne dans ce monde avec une plénitude de grâce. Assurez-vous qu'il n'y a pas de faute dans votre bureau parce que c'est ce que Dieu attend de vous. C'est la justice qu'il a apportée à cette vie et c'est la justice qu'il a financée par la croix. Faire preuve de diligence ajoute à votre foi, de la patience à votre vie et travaillez dur. Soyez patient, ajoutez des connaissances, lisez des livres, obtenez des CDS et ajoutez à votre foi.\nMaîtrise de soi   La tempérance est nécessaire ici. Vous devez avoir le contrôle de vous-même de toutes les manières, que ce soit le sommeil, les vêtements, la nourriture, la colère, tout. Soyez maître de vous-même et n'allez pas dans l'excès afin que cela n'affecte pas votre vie.\nAmour fraternel   Apprenez à aimer votre frère, à sourire et à parler joyeusement avec les gens. Essayez-le, apprenez-le et ne dites pas que c'est votre nature. Jésus est venu changer la nature dans cette vie. Par nature , nous ne sommes pas enfants de Dieu ni justes. Par conséquent, venez à la lumière du Christ, pratiquez-la et vous la rattraperez bientôt. Pratiquez la gentillesse, apprenez à donner, cela peut être douloureux dans votre cœur mais relâchez vos mains. Faites cela dans votre vie chrétienne; c'est ce que Dieu veut dans votre vie. La discipline divine est requise pour vous rendre saint.   **\nHébreux 12 verset 5 à 11   **\n\"Et vous avez oublié l'exhortation qui vous est adressée comme à des enfants, mon fils, ne méprise pas le châtiment du Seigneur, ne faiblis pas quand tu es réprimandé de lui. Pour qui le Seigneur aime\nil châtie et flagelle tout péché qu'il reçoit. Si vous endurez le châtiment, Dieu vous traite comme des fils ; car quel est le fils de celui que le père ne châtie pas ? Mais si vous n'avez pas de châtiment, là où tout le monde participe, alors vous êtes des bâtards et non des fils.  **\nDe plus, nous avons eu des pères de notre chair qui nous ont corrigés, et nous leur avons donné du respect   ne devrions-nous pas plutôt être soumis au père des esprits et des vies ? Car en vérité, pendant quelques jours, ils nous ont châtiés selon leur propre plaisir ; mais lui pour notre profit, afin que nous puissions participer à la sainteté. Or, aucun châtiment pour le moment ne semble être joyeux, mais douloureux, néanmoins par la suite il donne le fruit paisible de la justice à ceux qui s'y exercent.\nChâtiment divin, Dieu a une manière de traiter avec vous et ils sont pour votre sainteté, pureté et il a une manière, donc ne la rejetez pas. Ne murmurez pas et ne vous battez pas contre cela. Pourquoi a-t-il choisi d'emmener les enfants d'Israël à travers le désert ? Pourquoi pas une coupe droite, où il n'y avait aucun danger, bête sauvage ou serpent ? Il voulait leur prouver. Pourquoi Dieu a-t-il permis à la faim et au goût de venir sur eux ?\nIl voulait leur prouver. Pourquoi Dieu leur a-t-il permis de venir devant la grande mer rouge ? Il voulait démontrer Sa puissance mais, et prouver leur foi. Pourquoi Dieu a-t-il permis même à leurs ennemis d'avancer ou a-t-il permis des choses discutables dans votre vie ? Des choses qui vous apportent de la douleur, de la honte, de la déception, vous mettent à nu et des choses qui vous font aller dans telle ou telle direction ? Les gens se moquent même de vous. Pourquoi? C'est pour votre sainteté. Si vous pouvez vous préparer, vous fortifier à nouveau et rester debout malgré votre capacité à atteindre la sainteté. Si vous ne serez pas ému par ces choses mais que vous vous tiendrez, vous vous tiendrez à la sainteté.  **\nLa fraternité des frères -  **\nC'est pour purifier et préserver les croyants dans la sainteté de Dieu. À la communion des frères , nous nous rassemblons, nous encourageons les uns les autres, c'est ce que Dieu veut. Ne méprisez pas l'assemblée des croyants et ne l'abandonnez pas comme le font certains. Mais réunissez-vous et exhortez-vous les uns les autres alors que nous voyons le jour approcher. C'est bien que tu viennes ici. En effet, c'est très bien, alors décidez-vous que vous viendrez. Nous le faisons ensemble comme on prêche, vous écoutez et comme nous nous entendons, cela devient un privilège.\nAlors que je termine la prédication, je m'assieds alors qu'une autre personne s'approche et pendant qu'il prêche, nous écoutons et prions ensemble. Vous vous joignez aux gens pour prier, ce qui est très vital pour votre vie. Par conséquent, ne renoncez pas à l'assemblage, il vous gardera. Si vous appartenez à ce groupe, nous vous poserons toujours des questions sur vous, comment vous vous en sortez ou faites face à la vie. Oh, on ne t'a pas vu à la bourse, que s'est-il passé ? Vous saurez que vous avez des amis, des pères, des mères spirituelles, des frères et sœurs et ceux-ci prendront soin de votre vie. L'ennemi ne vous emportera pas car il priera pour vous. Maintenant, enfin, la Bible dit qu'il vous délivrera de nos ennemis et nous le servirons sans crainte. Si vous voulez être un saint homme, vous devez faire face à la peur, tant que vous aurez peur de l'office, la sainteté vous sera difficile.\nParce que vous tomberez dessus. Vous l'exalterez au-dessus de Dieu. Tant que vous serez si plein de crainte du gouvernement, la sainteté sera impossible. Je parle de l'esclavage et de la peur pour lesquels la sainteté sera impossible. Tant que vous aurez peur de l'église et de son autorité, la sainteté sera impossible parce que celui qui craint n'est pas rendu parfait dans l'amour, et Dieu est amour.\nCelui qui craint n'est pas de la foi donc, la sainteté sera impossible.  **\nTant que vous êtes soumis à la crainte de l'homme, la sainteté ne peut être vécue, car cet homme n'en aura pas le pouvoir. Tant que vous avez peur de votre femme, la sainteté n'est pas possible car vous direz toujours des mensonges pour lui plaire. Vous ferez des compromis tant que vous aurez peur de votre mari, de votre mariage et la sainteté ne sera pas possible.  **\n.C'est parce que vous exalterez le mariage au-dessus de Dieu. Toutes les exigences de Dieu que vous ne pourrez pas satisfaire à cause du mariage.\nVotre peur est que cela affectera votre mariage, vous ne pouvez donc pas être saint. Tant que vous aurez peur de vos amis et de vos relations, la sainteté ne sera pas possible. Vous devez faire face à la peur et voir tout comme cela n'existe pas et que seul Dieu existe alors, vous pouvez obéir à sa voix. Quand Il parle, il n'y a pas de voix compétitive, quand Il commande, il n'y a pas d'autorité compétitive. C'est alors que vous pouvez vivre une vie sainte. Vous allez chercher sa face pour la sainteté et vous direz   Dieu, je veux te servir dans la sainteté. La justice et la sainteté, je veux commencer. Que Dieu te bénisse!\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "SUCCÈS ET RÉALISATION PAR LA PRIÈRE, LE CONSEIL ET LA SAGESSE. **\n\nPASTEUR PAUL RIKA. **\n\nCHAPITRE UN **\nDIEU VOUS FAIT AVANCER **\nExode 14 verset 15 **\n« Et l'Éternel dit à Moïse : Pourquoi me cries-tu ? dis aux enfants d'Israël, qu'ils aillent de l'avant : » **\nBeaucoup de gens sont dans une position immobile et ce n'est pas la pensée de Dieu pour eux. Ils sont retardés, rabougris et stagnants. Ils n'avancent pas et ne progressent pas. Ce n'est pas la pensée de Dieu pour eux. Beaucoup blâment leur état sur le diable. Si c'est le diable, alors tous les incroyants devraient être arrêtés par le diable. Si les non-croyants enregistrent des succès, pourquoi les croyants devraient-ils penser que le diable est celui qui les empêche de progresser dans la vie ? Vous avez le nom de Jésus, vous avez la parole de Dieu, vous avez l'assemblée des saints, vous avez les promesses de Dieu. Les pécheurs n'ont pas tout cela, pourtant ils font des progrès. **\nDeutéronome 1 verset 6 à 8 **\n«Voici , j'ai mis le pays devant vous; entrez et prenez possession du pays que l'Éternel a juré à vos pères, Abraham, Isaac et Jacob, et l'Éternel, notre Dieu, nous a dit en Horeb: Vous avez assez habité cette montagne; **\n\tTourne-toi, et entreprends ton voyage, et va au mont des Amoréens, et dans tous les lieux voisins, dans la plaine, dans les collines, et dans la vallée, et dans le sud, et au bord de la mer, pour le pays des Cananéens, et jusqu'au Liban, jusqu'au grand fleuve, le fleuve Euphrate.\ndonne-leur, ainsi qu'à leur semence après eux. **\n \n1.1 Vous avez reçu le pouvoir de surmonter la stagnation **\nSi les pécheurs progressent, pourquoi rester immobiles et blâmer le diable ? Au contraire, blâmez-le sur votre ignorance, votre paresse et les ténèbres qui vous couvrent. Certains blâment les sorcières et les sorciers et, ce faisant, ils donnent le pouvoir tout-puissant aux êtres humains. Quelle que soit la prière qu'ils ont priée, ils croient qu'une sorcière était responsable de leur manque de progrès ou de succès dans la vie. Si les sorcières et les sorciers ont ce pouvoir, pourquoi n'ont-ils pas gêné tout le monde ? Mais que dit la parole de Dieu ? \"Voici, je vous donne le pouvoir de marcher sur les serpents et les scorpions, et sur toute la puissance de l'ennemi, et rien ne vous fera aucun mal.\" (Luc 10 verset 19). N'est-ce pas la parole de Dieu pour vous ? Les sorcières et les sorciers ont-ils plus de pouvoir que cela ? Alors pourquoi les incroyants réussissent-ils et font-ils des progrès dans la vie ? qui n'ont pas en eux le Saint-Esprit ni les promesses de Dieu ? **\n \nPsaume 73 verset 12 **\n«Voici, ce sont des impies qui prospèrent dans le monde; ils s'enrichissent. **\nD'autres blâment quelqu'un d'autre en disant que cet homme était responsable du fait que je n'allais pas à l'école ; cet homme était la raison pour laquelle cette chose ou cette chose m'est arrivée. Ils sont toujours à la recherche de quelqu'un à blâmer pour leurs échecs ou leurs malheurs. Il peut s'agir de maladie prolongée ou de mariage, de chômage, de retard de procréation, de pauvreté ou même de décès. **\nProverbes 6 versets 4 à 11 **\n\t\"Ne donne pas le sommeil à tes yeux, ni le sommeil à tes paupières.\n\tDélivre-toi comme un chevreuil de la main du chasseur, et comme un oiseau de la main de l'oiseleur.\n\tVa vers la fourmi, paresseux ; considère ses voies et sois sage :\n\tQui n'ayant ni guide, ni surveillant, ni dirigeant,\n\tFournit sa viande en été, et rassemble sa nourriture dans la moisson.\n\tCombien de temps dormiras-tu, ô paresseux ? Quand sortiras-tu de ton sommeil ?\n\tEncore un peu de sommeil, un peu de sommeil, un peu de jointure des mains pour dormir :\nAinsi viendra ta pauvreté comme un voyageur, et ta misère comme un homme armé. **\n \nMaintenant, je vous dis que le moment de surmonter ce problème est venu. Ce que j'ai dit est historique parce que la réalité est que vous sortez de ce problème en ce moment et que votre vie commencera à connaître de grands progrès et succès. Vous ne stagnerez plus au Nom de Jésus. Amen. Par la prière, par les conseils et la sagesse, vous sortirez triomphalement de votre état déplorable et vous progresserez dans la vie au nom de Jésus. Amen. **\n \nEsaïe 3 verset 10 **\n« Dites au juste que tout ira bien pour lui, car il mangera le fruit de ses actions. » **\nExode 14 verset 13 à 15 **\n\t« Et Moïse dit au peuple : Ne craignez pas, arrêtez-vous, et voyez le salut de l'Éternel, qu'il vous annoncera aujourd'hui, car les Égyptiens que vous avez vus aujourd'hui, vous ne les reverrez plus à jamais.\n\tL'Éternel combattra pour vous, et vous vous tiendrez tranquilles.\n\tEt l'Éternel dit à Moïse : pourquoi cries-tu à moi ? Dis aux enfants d'Israël qu'ils aillent de l'avant : » **\n \n1.2 Faites confiance au Seigneur et il établira vos démarches **\n \nProverbes 3 versets 1 à 6 **\n« Mon fils, n'oublie pas ma loi ; mais que ton cœur garde mes commandements ;\nPour la longueur des jours, et une longue vie, et la paix, ils t'ajouteront.\n\tQue la miséricorde et la vérité ne t'abandonnent pas ; lie-les à ton cou; écris-les sur la table de ton cœur :\n\tAinsi tu trouveras faveur et bon entendement aux yeux de Dieu et des hommes.\n\tConfie-toi en l'Éternel de tout ton cœur; et ne t'appuie pas sur ta propre intelligence. 6 Dans toutes tes voies, reconnais-le, et il aplanira tes sentiers » **\nPsaumes 40 versets 1 à 3 **\n« J'ai attendu patiemment l'Éternel ; et il s'inclina vers moi, et entendit mon cri.\n\tIl m'a aussi fait sortir d'une fosse horrible, de l'argile fangeuse, et a posé mes pieds sur un rocher, et a établi mes allées.\n\tEt il a mis un cantique nouveau dans ma bouche, des louanges à notre Dieu , beaucoup le verront, et craindront, et se confieront en l'Éternel. **\n \n« J'ai attendu patiemment le Seigneur ; et il s'est incliné vers moi et a entendu mon cri. Le Seigneur a dit que je devrais vous dire qu'il a entendu toutes ces prières. Il connaît votre patience. En fait, vous l'avez attendu longtemps ; vous L'avez attendu pendant des années; et maintenant le Seigneur a dit qu'il a prêté attention à votre cri. \"Il m'a aussi fait sortir d'une fosse horrible, de l'argile fangeuse, et a placé mes pieds sur un rocher, et a établi mes allées.\" Vous étiez coincé à un endroit, mais maintenant le Seigneur a étendu ses mains pour vous aider. Je vous assure que les mains de votre Père descendront du Ciel pour vous faire sortir de ce gouffre dans lequel vous vous êtes trouvé.\nIl est venu vous tirer de ce gouffre. Vous ne pouviez pas bouger à cause du sol boueux. Vos pieds étaient coincés dans l'argile. Mais maintenant, Il vous transportera sur le rocher. Vous allez maintenant avancer facilement. En fait, vous allez courir ! Lorsque des poussins agricoles ont été dans une cage et que la porte leur est soudainement ouverte, savez-vous que certains d'entre eux sautent et d'autres volent ? Vous volerez; vous vous envolerez vers votre destination. Vous réaliserez de grandes choses très rapidement. Votre retard sera récompensé. Le Seigneur vous rendra les années que les sauterelles, les jéleks et les palmiers ont dévorées. Pour votre chagrin, vous recevrez le double. Vous volerez. Je veux dire que la grâce va vous faire voler. Vos camarades de classe vous ont dépassé, mais vous les dépasserez. La puissance de Dieu, la grâce de Dieu, l'amour de Dieu et la miséricorde de Dieu vous localiseront et travailleront dans votre vie. Amen! **\n \n1.3 Soyez déterminé à réussir et à réussir **\nDécidez-vous aujourd'hui d'être une nouvelle personne. Les choses anciennes devraient disparaître et toutes choses devraient devenir nouvelles. Décidez-vous que les anciennes choses devraient passer, que de nouvelles choses devraient maintenant avoir lieu. Alors que vous avez travaillé sans voir le gain ; à partir d'aujourd'hui croyez que vous verrez vos gains rassemblés.\nLa bouche du Seigneur l'a dit et le Seigneur l'accomplira pour vous. Recevez la parole de la bouche de Dieu. Amen. :**\ndeuxième Corinthiens 4 verset 13 **\n« Nous ayant le même esprit de foi, selon qu'il est écrit, j'ai cru, et c'est pourquoi j'ai parlé ; nous croyons aussi, et c'est pourquoi nous parlons ; » **\nSoyez résolu dans votre cœur que vous ne resterez jamais dans votre situation de vie actuelle. Dites-vous simplement, dites à votre environnement, même aux arbres qui se dressent autour de vous. Dis à l'arbre : « Arbre, tu es mon voisin depuis longtemps et tu as vu à quel point j'étais misérable ; mais arbre, je ne vais plus être comme ça. Vous serez témoin d'un homme nouveau. Alléluia! Cette maladie mourra. Votre pauvreté sera ôtée. Votre dépression conjugale cessera. Votre arrêt académique prendra fin. Amen. **\nEsaïe 43 verset 18 à 23 **\n\t« Ne vous souvenez pas des choses anciennes, et ne considérez pas les choses anciennes.\n\tVoici, je vais faire une chose nouvelle , maintenant elle va germer; ne le saurez-vous pas ? Je ferai même un chemin dans le désert, et des fleuves dans le désert.\n\tLes bêtes des champs m'honoreront, les dragons et les hiboux , parce que je donne des eaux dans le désert, et des fleuves dans le désert, pour abreuver mon peuple, mon élu.\n\tCe peuple je me suis formé ; ils proclameront ma louange.\n\tMais tu ne m'as pas invoqué, ô Jacob; mais tu t'es lassé de moi, ô\nIsraël.\"\nDieu vous attend depuis longtemps. N'est-il pas le Dieu du progrès ? Quand Il a fait le soleil et la lune et a commencé à compter les jours, n'est-ce pas pour le progrès ? N'avez-vous pas fait de progrès dans les années de votre vie ? Alors pourquoi pas dans d'autres domaines ? C'est un Dieu qui veut que vous progressiez. Je prononce des progrès sur votre vie au Nom de Jésus. En fait, à cette époque l'année prochaine, vous serez plein de témoignages. Oui, je m'adresse à vous qui stagnez aujourd'hui, car quelque chose attend déjà votre vie. Alléluia, Amen ! **\n1.4 Les quatre lépreux ont refusé de rester assis et de mourir dans leur état. **\nDeuxième Rois 7 versets 3 à 9 **\n\t« Et il y avait quatre hommes lépreux à l'entrée de la porte ; et ils se dirent l'un à l'autre : pourquoi nous asseoir ici jusqu'à ce que nous mourions ?\n\tSi nous disons, nous entrerons dans la ville, alors la famine est dans la ville, et nous y mourrons et si nous restons assis ici, nous mourrons aussi. Maintenant donc, venez, et tombons dans l'armée des Syriens. S'ils nous sauvent la vie, nous vivrons ; et s'ils nous tuent, nous ne ferons que mourir.\n\tEt ils se levèrent au crépuscule pour aller au camp des Syriens , et lorsqu'ils furent arrivés à l'extrémité du camp de Syrie, voici, il n'y avait personne là-bas.\n\tCar l'Éternel avait fait entendre à l'armée des Syriens un bruit de chars et un bruit de chevaux, le bruit d'une grande armée; et ils se dirent l'un à l'autre : Voici, le roi d'Israël a engagé contre nous les rois des Hittites et les rois des Égyptiens, pour venir sur nous.\n\tC'est pourquoi ils se levèrent et s'enfuirent au crépuscule, et quittèrent leurs tentes, et leurs chevaux, et leurs ânes, même le camp tel qu'il était, et s'enfuirent pour sauver leur vie.\n\tEt quand ces lépreux arrivèrent à l'extrémité du camp, ils entrèrent dans une tente, et mangèrent et burent, et en emportèrent de l'argent, et de l'or, et des vêtements, et allèrent les cacher ; et revint, et entra dans une autre tente, et en emporta aussi, et alla la cacher. \n\tAlors ils se dirent l'un à l'autre, nous n'allons pas bien : ce jour est un jour de bonne nouvelle, et nous nous taisons : si nous tardons jusqu'à la lumière du matin, quelque mal nous arrivera, maintenant donc venez que nous puissions aller et dites-le à la maison du roi. **\nDans ce texte, la Bible nous parle de quatre lépreux et de la décision qu'ils ont prise. C'est la décision que vous devez prendre maintenant. Quatre lépreux ont remporté la victoire ! Quatre lépreux ont gagné la guerre !! Vous gagnerez la guerre !!! Tous ces ennemis qui se rassemblent autour et ne permettront pas aux gens de progresser ou de réussir seront réduits au silence par votre progression rapide. Maintenant, décidez-vous, levez-vous et dites : « J'avance. Je réussirai au nom du Seigneur des Armées. Je ferai de grandes réalisations grâce au soutien du Seigneur des Armées. Au fur et à mesure que vous vous déplacez, les miracles de Dieu se déplaceront avec vous. Au fur et à mesure que vous vous déplacez, les miracles de Dieu vous précéderont. L'ennemi verra et fuira. Dieu vous attendait depuis tout ce temps. Vous avez été si paresseux que vous ne pouviez pas bouger. Tu as l'air d'un boiteux, mais maintenant, tu vas marcher ! Amen. **\nMatt hew 8 versets 2 et 3 **\n\t« Et voici, un lépreux vint et se prosterna devant lui, en disant : Seigneur, si tu veux, tu peux me rendre pur.\n\tEt Jésus étendit la main, et le toucha, en disant : Je veux ; sois pur. Et aussitôt sa lèpre a été nettoyée. ” **\n \n1.5 Levez-vous et possédez votre possession **\nDans mon village, à cette époque, lorsqu'un enfant infirme refuse de marcher et que sa mère veut qu'il marche, ce qu'ils font, c'est de le mettre dans un panier et de le tirer en disant : « Lève-toi et marche ! Vous vous lèverez et marcherez au nom de Jésus. Le Seigneur vous demande de marcher. Avancez et accomplissez quelque chose pour Dieu ; réaliser quelque chose pour Jésus. **\nMatthieu 14 verset 27 à 29 **\n\t« Mais aussitôt Jésus leur parla, disant : Ayez bon courage ; c'est moi; n'aie pas peur.\n\tEt Pierre lui répondit et dit: Seigneur, si c'est toi, ordonne-moi de venir à toi sur l'eau.\n\tEt il dit : Viens. Et quand Pierre fut descendu de la barque, il marcha sur l'eau pour aller vers Jésus. ” **\nAlors que vous viviez dans une pièce avec votre femme, vous allez déménager dans un appartement de 3 chambres. Dieu vous attendait . Des miracles vous attendaient. Cela arrivera. Je dis, cela arrivera; il y aura un spectacle ! Un homme en particulier avait besoin d'argent pour organiser un programme pour Dieu. Il a dit : « Dieu, je veux organiser une croisade et je cherche dix mille dollars pour cela. Quand il a fini cette prière, il a commencé à bouger. Alors qu'il se déplaçait pour obtenir les 10 000,00 $, le Saint-Esprit s'est déplacé avec lui. C'est ce qui va vous arriver.\nLa transformation arrive dans votre vie. Le Saint-Esprit va entrer dans votre vie. **\nTandis qu'il continuait à avancer, le Saint-Esprit parla : « Entrez dans cette maison et demandez si la maison est à vendre. Il entra dans la maison et y vit une dame. Il a demandé : « Cette maison est-elle à vendre ? La dame le regarda avec surprise et lui demanda : \"As-tu vu 'À vendre' écrit sur la maison ?\" L'homme de Dieu a répondu: \"Oh désolé, il était juste mis dans mon cœur de venir demander.\" La dame a alors répondu: \"En fait, le propriétaire de la maison vient de prendre la décision de vendre la maison.\" L'homme a répondu: \"Oh, est-ce vrai? Je suis prêt à l'acheter. Ils ont conclu un accord et l'homme de Dieu est allé dire aux gens qu'il avait une maison à vendre. Laissez la sagesse de Dieu venir sur votre vie. Recevez la sagesse au nom de Jésus. **\nProverbes 4 versets 5 à 7 **\n« Obtenez la sagesse, obtenez la compréhension : ne l'oubliez pas ; ni déclin des paroles de ma bouche.\n\tNe l'abandonne pas, et elle te gardera , aime-la, et elle te gardera.\nLa sagesse est la chose principale; acquiers donc la sagesse , et avec tout ce que tu as acquis, acquiers l'intelligence. “ **\nAinsi, l'homme de Dieu a rapidement trouvé un acheteur car le Seigneur l'attendait pour son miracle. Le Seigneur vous attendait pour un miracle. Il fera cette chose Lui-même. Levez-vous simplement et faites un pas de foi. Dès que ta jambe touchera le Jourdain, elle se dessèchera. Il a trouvé un acheteur et a conclu l'affaire avec lui. La différence était de dix mille dollars. Il a perçu l'argent de l'acheteur, a retiré sa marge bénéficiaire de 10 000,00 $ et a remis le solde au vendeur. C'est ainsi qu'il a obtenu l'argent qu'il a demandé au Seigneur. C'est la sagesse qui vient sur votre vie aujourd'hui. Votre vie sera un témoignage. **\n \n1.6 Le jour de la bonne nouvelle pour vous **\nDeuxième Rois 7 versets 8 à 9 **\n« Et quand ces lépreux arrivèrent à l'extrémité du camp, ils entrèrent dans une tente, et mangèrent et burent, et en emportèrent de l'argent, et de l'or, et des vêtements, et allèrent les cacher ; et revint, et entra dans une autre tente, et en emporta aussi, et alla la cacher.\nAlors ils se dirent l'un à l'autre, nous n'allons pas bien ; ce jour est un jour de bonne nouvelle, et nous nous taisons ; si nous tardons jusqu'à la lumière du matin, quelque mal viendra sur nous ; maintenant donc viens, que nous puissions aller prévenir la maison du roi.\n \nDe nombreuses personnes vous attendent. Il y a des mendiants qui viendront à vous et diront : « Que Dieu vous donne ce que vous devrez peut-être nous donner. Vous l'aurez parce que Dieu a aligné des gens derrière vous et ils vous attendent. Dieu veut vous financer. Dieu veut vous élever à cause des gens qui sont alignés et qui attendent que vous ayez. Où es-tu? Dieu attend que vous fassiez un pas de progrès, un pas de succès et un pas de réalisation, afin qu'il puisse faire ses miracles dans votre vie et à travers vous, d'autres seront également bénis. Dieu vous donnera la sagesse. Il vous donnera des conseils sur ce qu'il faut faire pour mettre fin à votre pauvreté, votre maladie, votre honte et votre disgrâce. Amen. **\n \nGenèse 12 verset 1 à 3 **\n« Or l'Éternel avait dit à Abram : Va-t'en de ton pays, et de ta parenté, et de la maison de ton père, vers un pays que je te montrerai :\nEt je ferai de toi une grande nation, et je te bénirai, et je rendrai ton nom grand; et tu seras une bénédiction;\nEt je bénirai ceux qui te béniront, et maudirai celui qui te maudira, et en toi toutes les familles de la terre seront bénies. :**\n\nCHAPITRE DEUX **\nNOUS SERVONS LE DIEU VIVANT **\n2.1 Dieu est capable de changer les choses pour vous du jour au lendemain **\nGenèse 18 verset 9 à 14 **\n« Et ils lui dirent : Où est Sara, ta femme ? Et il dit: Voici, dans la tente.\nEt il dit: Je reviendrai certainement vers toi selon le temps de la vie; et voici, Sara, ta femme, aura un fils. Et Sara l'entendit à l'entrée de la tente, qui était derrière lui.\nOr Abraham et Sarah étaient vieux et bien atteints en âge ; et il cessa d'être avec Sara à la manière des femmes.\nC'est pourquoi Sara rit en elle-même, disant : Après que je serai vieillie, aurai-je du plaisir, mon seigneur étant aussi vieux ?\nEt le Seigneur dit à Abraham : Pourquoi Sara a-t-elle ri, en disant : Dois-je certainement enfanter un enfant qui est vieux ?\nY a-t-il quelque chose de trop difficile pour le Seigneur ? Au temps fixé, je reviendrai vers toi, selon le temps de la vie, et Sarah aura un fils. **\nJ'ai entendu l'histoire d'un homme dans un État riche en pétrole du Nigeria (Port Harcourt, Rivers State). Cet homme avait été pauvre et il savait qu'il y a un DIEU, Son père qui répond aux prières. Alors il a commencé à se demander pourquoi il devrait être pauvre. Il a décidé de faire quelque chose pour sa situation financière. Souvenez-vous que je vous ai dit que Dieu vous attendait. Vous êtes assis là et dites que vous attendez Dieu pendant que Dieu dit que je vous attends. Qui doit faire le premier pas ? Est-ce Dieu ou vous ? Qui est le plus grand ? Qui doit passer en premier ? Alors, l'homme est entré dans une pièce et s'est enfermé pendant trois jours et a dit à Dieu : « Dieu, tu dois changer ma situation. Je ne peux pas rester dans cette pauvreté ; Je ne peux pas rester dans cet état. Non, ma situation doit changer. **\nEsaïe 38 verset 1 à 7 **\n« En ces jours-là, Ézéchias était malade à mort. Et Ésaïe, le prophète, fils d'Amots, vint vers lui, et lui dit : Ainsi dit l'Éternel : Mets ta maison en ordre ; car tu mourras et tu ne vivras pas.\nAlors Ézéchias tourna son visage vers la muraille et pria l'Éternel,\nEt dit, souviens-toi maintenant, Seigneur, je t'en supplie, comment j'ai marché devant toi dans la vérité et avec un coeur parfait, et j'ai fait ce qui est bon à tes yeux. Et Ézéchias pleura amèrement.\nAlors vint la parole du Seigneur à Isaïe, disant :\nVa, et dis à Ézéchias : Ainsi a dit l'Éternel, le Dieu de David, ton père : J'ai entendu ta prière, j'ai vu tes larmes, voici, j'ajouterai à tes jours quinze ans.\nEt je te délivrerai, toi et cette ville, de la main du roi d'Assyrie; et je défendrai cette ville.\nEt ceci sera pour toi un signe de la part du Seigneur, que le Seigneur fera la chose qu'il a dite; ” **\n \nJe vous ai dit que votre propre situation se termine maintenant. L'homme a poursuivi: «Dieu, tu dois changer mon état; tu dois me faire prospérer; vous devez me mettre à jour ; tu dois me relever; vous devez me montrer le chemin; vous devez me montrer comment je vais y parvenir. Il pria jusqu'à ce que Dieu dise : « Je t'ai exaucé mon fils. J'ai répondu à votre prière. Dieu attend d'entendre les prières de quelqu'un. Alors le Seigneur a dit: «Peux-tu voir la parcelle de terre là-bas; où ils déversent les déchets? Il répondit : \"Oui, Seigneur.\" Dieu lui dit : \"Va chercher le propriétaire et achète-le.\" Même si la voix qui lui parlait était claire et sans équivoque, il a commencé à se demander pourquoi il achèterait une parcelle de terrain qui est un dépotoir. Mais Dieu avait déjà parlé. Il avait prié pour que Dieu le fasse prospérer et Dieu lui a dit quoi faire. Dieu vous dira quoi faire ! **\nJean 2 versets 1 à 5 **\n« Et le troisième jour, il y eut des noces à Cana de Galilée ; et la mère de Jésus était là;\nEt Jésus fut appelé, ainsi que ses disciples, aux noces.\nEt comme ils manquaient de vin, la mère de Jésus lui dit : ils n'ont pas de vin.\nJésus lui dit : Femme, qu'ai-je à faire avec toi ? Mon heure n'est pas encore venue.\nSa mère dit aux serviteurs : tout ce qu'il vous dira, faites-le. ” **\nL'homme alla chercher le propriétaire du terrain qui s'étonnait que quelqu'un vienne acheter un tel terrain en friche. L'homme a acheté le terrain et est retourné vers Dieu pour dire: \"Seigneur, j'ai acheté le terrain.\" Dieu lui a dit. \"D'accord, c'est la réponse à ta prière.\" Les voies de Dieu peuvent sembler insensées, mais c'est la plus grande sagesse. Après un certain temps, une compagnie pétrolière est venue dans cette région et a découvert du pétrole brut sous la terre. La pauvreté avait pris fin avec cet homme ! La grandeur était venue ; la richesse était venue; les richesses étaient venues. Oh Seigneur, déverse-le sur ton peuple maintenant. La terre appartient au Seigneur et sa plénitude. C'est ce que Dieu veut faire dans votre vie. C'est ce que Dieu veut accomplir dans votre vie. Laissez le Seigneur vous ouvrir la porte de la prospérité. Laissez-le ouvrir la porte à vos enfants ; laissez-le ouvrir la porte de votre famille au nom de Jésus, Amen. **\nApocalypse 3 verset 8 **\n\"Je connais tes oeuvres, voici, j'ai mis devant toi une porte ouverte, et personne ne peut la fermer, car tu as peu de force, et tu as gardé ma parole, et tu n'as pas renié mon nom.\" **\n2.2 Si les gens du monde prospèrent par la sagesse charnelle, combien plus vous par la sagesse divine ?\nMême dans les affaires de cette vie, les êtres humains dans la sagesse naturelle de la terre (parfois même la sagesse pécheresse), sont capables de faire quelque chose de grand pour leur vie. **\nLuc 16 verset 1 à 8 **\n\t« Et il dit aussi à ses disciples : Il y avait un certain homme riche, qui avait un intendant ; et celui-ci lui fut accusé d'avoir gaspillé ses biens.\n\tEt il l'appela, et lui dit: Comment se fait-il que j'apprenne cela de toi? Rendez compte de votre intendance; car tu ne peux plus être intendant.\n\tAlors l'intendant dit en lui-même, que dois-je faire ? Car mon seigneur m'enlève l'intendance , je ne peux pas creuser; mendier j'ai honte.\n\tJe suis résolu à faire, afin que, quand je serai mis hors de l'intendance, ils puissent me recevoir dans leurs maisons.\n\tIl appela donc à lui chacun des débiteurs de son seigneur, et dit au premier : Combien dois-tu à mon seigneur ?\n\tEt il dit: Cent mesures d'huile. Et il lui dit : Prends ton billet, assieds-toi vite, et écris cinquante.\n\tAlors il dit à un autre : Et combien dois-tu ? Et il dit : Cent mesures de froment. Et il lui dit : Prends ton billet, et écris quatre-vingts.\n\tEt le seigneur loua l'intendant injuste, parce qu'il avait fait sagement ; car les enfants de ce monde sont dans leur génération plus sages que les enfants de la lumière. **\n \nCet homme était directeur d'une entreprise, mais il a gaspillé l'argent du propriétaire de l'entreprise. L'homme l'a appelé et lui a dit, rends maintenant compte de ton travail, car tu ne peux plus refaire ce travail. Cet homme est un pécheur, mais il a utilisé la sagesse charnelle, la sagesse corrompue, pour résoudre son problème. Voyez ce qu'il a fait dans les versets trois et quatre **\nLuc 16 verset 3 à 4. **\n\t« Alors l'intendant se dit en lui-même, que dois-je faire ? Car mon seigneur m'enlève l'intendance, je ne peux pas creuser; mendier j'ai honte.\n\tJe suis résolu à faire, afin que, quand je serai mis hors de l'intendance, ils puissent me recevoir dans leurs maisons. ” **\nGrâce à la sagesse charnelle, il a obtenu une solution bien que pécheresse. Il a dit, j'ai été habitué à l'argent facile et je ne peux plus travailler dur. Je ne peux pas aller à la ferme parce que mes mains vont déchirer la ferme. Je ne peux pas mendier dans la rue car ce serait honteux. De plus, j'ai une peau claire que je maintiens grâce à un régime alimentaire spécial. Les gens vont se demander ce qui ne va pas chez moi. Ils peuvent même penser que je suis devenu fou. Que vais-je faire alors ? Oh oui, je sais quoi faire, se dit-il par sagesse charnelle. Vous valez mieux que cet homme, pourtant l'homme s'est sorti de ce problème. Dieu sera celui qui vous fera sortir. Dieu peut-il le faire ? Oui il peut. **\nEsaïe 45 verset 22 **\n\"Regardez-moi, et soyez sauvés, toutes les extrémités de la terre car je suis Dieu, et il n'y en a pas d'autre.\" **\nLuc 16 verset 5 à 7. **\n\t« Alors, il appela à lui chacun des débiteurs de son seigneur, et dit au premier : Combien dois-tu à mon seigneur ?\n\tEt il dit: Cent mesures d'huile. Et il lui dit : Prends ton billet, assieds-toi vite, et écris cinquante.\n\tAlors il dit à un autre : Et combien dois-tu ? Et il dit : Cent mesures de froment. Et il lui dit : Prends ton billet, et écris quatre-vingts. ” **\nIl dit à l'un des débiteurs de son maître : « Je réduis ta dette de moitié. Payez-le vite avant que mon maître n'arrive. Je ne veux pas que mon maître le sache parce que je te rends service. À un autre qui devait cent mesures de blé, « Je vous en donne vingt gratuitement, alors écrivez quatre-vingts ». Entre-temps, il n'a pas révélé aux débiteurs de son maître qu'il était sur le point de perdre son emploi. Il leur a plutôt donné l'impression qu'il ne leur faisait qu'une faveur. Ce type de comportement est caractéristique de certains gouverneurs d'État de certains États du Nigéria qui paient des salaires en période électorale afin d'obtenir les votes des fonctionnaires. C'est la sagesse du monde. Ils doivent des salaires depuis des années, mais lorsque les élections approchent et qu'ils veulent briguer un second mandat, ils commencent à faire semblant d'aimer le peuple. Le gouverneur dira : « Je vois que le peuple souffre et en tant que gouverneur de miséricorde, je lui paierai cinq mois d'arriérés de salaire. C'est la sagesse du monde. **\nLe verset 8 dit : « Et le Seigneur a loué l'intendant injuste, parce qu'il avait agi avec sagesse : car les enfants de ce monde sont en leur génération plus sages que les enfants de la lumière. Peux tu voir? Lorsque le maître de cet intendant vint entendre ce qu'il avait fait après son départ, il dit que ces pécheurs sont des gens intelligents. Maintenant, l'intendant pouvait dire aux débiteurs qu'il avait remis une partie de leur dette qu'il ne savait pas ce qu'il avait fait de mal qui avait poussé son maître à le renvoyer. Les gens se demanderont parce qu'ils diraient, mais tu es un homme gentil. N'est-ce pas vous qui avez réduit notre dette envers votre maître ? Au lieu de cent mesures de blé, nous n'en avons payé que quatre-vingts. L'intendant leur dira: \"Oh, j'ai fait preuve de miséricorde parce que je sais que vous êtes bons.\" Ainsi, avec ce beau langage, ils le recevront dans leurs maisons et lui témoigneront leur faveur. C'est la sagesse affichée par les gens du monde. Cela l'a délivré d'aller creuser. Cela l'a délivré de la mendicité. **\nMarc 8 verset 36 à 37 **\n\t« A quoi bon pour un homme de gagner le monde entier, mais de perdre son âme ?\n\tOu que peut donner un homme en échange de son âme ? ” **\n2. 3 Vous avez besoin de la sagesse divine pour progresser et réussir dans la vie **\nMais il y a une sagesse meilleure et supérieure. Il y a la sagesse de la restauration. C'est la sagesse qui vous ramènera à la vie, vous ramènera à votre position et à un meilleur état. C'est une sagesse propre que Dieu fournira. C'est la sagesse qui apportera une promotion à votre vie. C'est la sagesse que le fils prodigue a exercée dans son état rétrograde et a été restauré à nouveau. **\nLuc 15 verset 14 à 24 **\n\t« Et quand il eut tout dépensé, il y eut une grande famine dans ce pays ; et il commença à être dans le besoin.\n\tEt il alla se joindre à un citoyen de ce pays; et il l'envoya dans ses champs pour nourrir les porcs.\n\tEt il aurait voulu se remplir le ventre des cosses que les porcs avaient mangées, et personne ne lui en avait donné.\n\tEt quand il revint à lui, il dit : combien de mercenaires de mon père ont du pain en suffisance et à revendre, et je meurs de faim !\n\tJe me lèverai, j'irai vers mon père, et je lui dirai : Père, j'ai péché contre le ciel et contre toi,\n\tEt je ne suis plus digne d'être appelé ton fils , fais de moi l'un de tes mercenaires.\n\tEt il se leva, et vint vers son père. Mais alors qu'il était encore très loin, son père le vit, eut pitié, courut, se jeta à son cou et l'embrassa.\n\tEt le fils lui dit: Père, j'ai péché contre le ciel et contre toi, et je ne suis plus digne d'être appelé ton fils.\n\tMais le père dit à ses serviteurs : Apportez la plus belle robe, et mettez-la-lui ; et mit un anneau à sa main, et des souliers à ses pieds;\n\tEt amenez ici le veau gras, et tuez-le; et mangeons et réjouissons-nous ;\n\tC'est pourquoi mon fils était mort, et il est revenu à la vie ; il était perdu et est retrouvé. Et ils commencèrent à être joyeux. ” **\nIci, la Bible nous raconte l'histoire du fils prodigue. Il a obtenu la richesse de son père et l'a gaspillée. Il est devenu malheureux et était dans un état pitoyable. Il est revenu à la raison et par la sagesse divine, il a fait un pas qui l'a fait restaurer dans la maison de son père et ses privilèges lui ont été restaurés. Cela va être votre cas au nom de Jésus. La sagesse dont vous avez besoin dans votre vie est celle qui vous rendra les bénédictions divines. C'est la sagesse qui ôtera de vous l'iniquité, ôtera de vous le mal et le péché, et apportera la repentance dans votre vie. C'est la sagesse qui vous rendra la faveur divine, les richesses divines et les bénédictions divines. C'est la sagesse dont vous avez besoin dans votre vie. Vous avez besoin de la sagesse qui vous apportera la repentance et vous fera confesser vos péchés. La raison pour laquelle vous êtes devenu si misérable, c'est que vous vous êtes gaspillé avec des prostituées, que vous êtes tombé dans la drogue, que vous avez rejoint l'occultisme et que vous avez fait toutes sortes de mal. Vous devez être déterminé à arrêter ces choses, à vous tourner vers Dieu et à vivre saint afin d'entrer dans Sa bénédiction. C'est la sagesse dont vous avez besoin. **\nEsaïe 1 verset 16 à 20 **\n\t« Te laver, te rendre propre ; ôte de devant mes yeux la méchanceté de tes actions; cesser de faire le mal;\n\tApprenez à bien faire; Cherchez le jugement, soulagez l'opprimé, jugez l'orphelin, plaidez pour la veuve.\n\tVenez maintenant, et raisonnons ensemble, dit le Seigneur : même si vos péchés sont comme le cramoisi, ils deviendront blancs comme la neige ; s'ils sont rouges comme la pourpre, ils seront comme la laine.\n\tSi vous êtes disposés et obéissants, vous mangerez les biens du pays ;\n\tMais si vous refusez et vous rebellez, vous serez dévorés par l'épée ; car la bouche du Seigneur a parlé. **\n\nDans les deux cas de l'intendant avisé et du fils prodigue que nous venons de considérer, il y avait une volonté de ne pas rester dans le même état. Il y avait une volonté de ne pas souffrir de la pauvreté. Il y avait une volonté de ne pas rester dans la misère. Cette détermination a donné à l'un d'eux la sagesse charnelle, bien que ce genre de sagesse ne puisse pas durer et ne puisse donner le plein résultat souhaité. Mais la sagesse divine appliquée par le fils prodigue lui a donné une restauration totale, une faveur totale, l'approbation de Dieu et il a été restauré. La société est entrée dans la fête. Que Dieu vous reçoive de telle sorte que votre famille se mette en fête. Votre société aussi devrait se réjouir à cause de vous. Vos frères qui connaissaient votre situation hier seront témoins de votre glorieux lendemain et iront dans la célébration. Être déterminé! C'est ce que Dieu veut que vous fassiez et Il est prêt à vous soutenir. **\n \nLuc 15 verset17 à 19 **\n« Et quand il revint à lui, il dit : Combien de mercenaires de mon père ont du pain en suffisance et en surplus, et je meurs de faim !\n\tJe me lèverai, j'irai vers mon père, et je lui dirai : Père, j'ai péché contre le ciel et contre toi,\n\tEt je ne suis plus digne d'être appelé ton fils , fais de moi l'un de tes mercenaires. **\n \n2.4 La sagesse et la sainteté sont deux d'une sorte **\nIl est maintenant temps de recevoir la sagesse divine. Dieu vous donnera la sagesse. La sagesse est la chose principale. La sagesse est la chose la plus importante. En ce qui concerne cette vie, les deux autoroutes sont l'autoroute de la sainteté et l'autoroute de la sagesse. Ils sont comme deux pouvoirs de succès, mais ils sont en fait un seul pouvoir de succès - la sagesse et la sainteté. Ils parlent de la même chose. La sainteté est Dieu et la sagesse est Dieu. Il est temps pour vous de recevoir la sagesse. **\nProverbes 8 versets 1 à 7, 12 à 21 **\n\t« La sagesse ne pleure-t-elle pas ? Et la compréhension a fait entendre sa voix ?\n\tElle se tient au sommet des hauts lieux, sur le chemin aux places des sentiers.\n\tElle crie aux portes, à l'entrée de la ville, à l'entrée aux portes.\n\tA vous, ô hommes, j'appelle; et ma voix s'adresse aux fils de l'homme.\n\tÔ simples, comprenez la sagesse ; et, insensés, soyez d'un cœur intelligent.\n\tEntendre; car je parlerai de choses excellentes; et l'ouverture de mes lèvres sera des choses justes.\n\tCar ma bouche dira la vérité; et la méchanceté est en abomination à mes lèvres.\n\tJe la sagesse habite avec la prudence, et découvre la connaissance des inventions spirituelles.\n\tLa crainte de l'Éternel est de haïr le mal; je hais l'orgueil, l'arrogance, la mauvaise voie et la bouche obstinée.\n\tLe conseil est le mien, et la saine sagesse , je comprends; J'ai de la force.\n\tPar moi les rois règnent et les princes décrètent la justice.\n\tPar moi règnent les princes, et les nobles, même tous les juges de la terre.\n\tj'aime ceux qui m'aiment; et ceux qui me cherchent de bonne heure me trouveront.\n\tLa richesse et l'honneur sont avec moi ; oui, richesse durable et justice.\n\tMon fruit vaut mieux que l'or, oui, que l'or fin ; et mon revenu que l'argent de choix.\n\tJe conduis dans le chemin de la justice, au milieu des sentiers du jugement :\n\tQue je puisse faire hériter de la substance à ceux qui m'aiment; et je remplirai leurs trésors. ” **\n \nPeut-être que quelqu'un a intercédé pour que Dieu se souvienne de vous dans votre état et aujourd'hui Dieu veut se souvenir de vous. Peut-être que les saints d'autrefois priaient pour que le Seigneur ouvre les écluses du ciel vers la fin des temps et déverse richesses et richesses, honneur et gloire sur ses enfants au-dessus de ce que le diable a donné aux siens afin que les gens voient la gloire de Dieu que plus d'âmes devraient être converties. Peut-être ont-ils prié ainsi et c'est pourquoi le Seigneur dit maintenant : « Je commence maintenant. Le Seigneur commence maintenant. Il déversera la richesse, la richesse, l'honneur, la promotion et élèvera le peuple du Seigneur. Le Seigneur commence maintenant et je suis si heureux que vous deveniez riche par ce mouvement de Dieu. C'est merveilleux ! Sœur, votre honneur augmentera. Mon frère, les gens s'émerveilleront quand ils visiteront votre maison et que vous les ferez visiter votre duplex et qu'ils verront des voitures garées tout autour de votre enceinte. Quand ils liront ce que vous avez écrit sur votre mur en disant : « Jésus est le propriétaire de cette maison », ils se demanderont quelle grande chose Jésus a faite dans votre vie. Ils diront, afin que Jésus puisse rendre quelqu'un aussi grand. Maintenant, allez-vous permettre à Jésus de commencer par vous ? Allez préparez-vous. Certains pensent que les prédicateurs sont des gens pauvres. Me voyez-vous pauvre ? La richesse et la richesse appartiennent à Dieu et Il donne à Ses enfants. :**\nProverbes 8 verset 17 à 21 **\n\t« J'aime ceux qui m'aiment ; et ceux qui me cherchent de bonne heure me trouveront.\n\tLa richesse et l'honneur sont avec moi ; oui, richesse durable et justice.\n\tMon fruit vaut mieux que l'or, oui, que l'or fin ; et mon revenu que l'argent de choix.\n\tJe conduis dans le chemin de la justice, au milieu des sentiers du jugement ;\n\tQue je puisse faire hériter de la substance à ceux qui m'aiment; et je remplirai leurs trésors. ” **\n \nUn prédicateur en particulier qui avait une maîtrise a dit que lorsqu'il répondait à l'appel à prêcher à temps plein, ses proches ont dit : « Oh, nous vous plaignons. Nous vous plaignons car vous allez bientôt cueillir des oranges que les gens ont sucées et jetées par terre. Dieu veut réprimander et faire taire ces gens par le quantum de gloire, d'honneur et de richesse qu'il déversera sur votre vie. Amen. A cause de toi, beaucoup courront vers le Seigneur. Ils se rendront compte que c'est avec le Seigneur que les choses se passent. Ils courront vers le Seigneur pour recevoir leur propre bénédiction. Par cela, Dieu fait une déclaration audacieuse : « Je rends les gens riches ! **\n \nMAINTENANT, COMMENT OBTENEZ-VOUS CETTE SAGESSE ? TRÈS SIMPLE! **\nProverbes 2 versets 1 à 11 **\n\t« Mon fils, si tu veux recevoir mes paroles, et cacher mes commandements avec toi ;\n\tDe sorte que tu inclines ton oreille vers la sagesse, et que tu appliques ton cœur à l'intelligence ;\n\tOui, si tu cries après la connaissance, et élève ta voix pour comprendre ;\n\tSi tu la cherches comme de l'argent, et que tu la cherches comme des trésors cachés ;\n\tAlors tu comprendras la crainte de l'Éternel, et tu trouveras la connaissance de Dieu.\n\tCar l'Éternel donne la sagesse ; de sa bouche vient la connaissance et l'intelligence.\n\tIl amasse une saine sagesse pour les justes , Il est un bouclier pour ceux qui marchent dans l'intégrité.\n\tIl garde les sentiers du jugement et préserve la voie de ses saints.\n\tAlors tu comprendras la justice, et le jugement, et l'équité ; oui, chaque bon chemin.\n\tQuand la sagesse entre dans ton cœur, et que la connaissance est agréable à ton âme ;\nLa discrétion te gardera, l'intelligence te gardera : » **\n \nC'est la sagesse que Dieu a donnée à Job. Le Seigneur amène les jours de Job à être reproduits à notre époque où la richesse et l'honneur iront avec la justice. Ce n'est pas que Dieu vous donnera des richesses et que vous L'abandonnerez. Non! Job n'a pas abandonné Dieu, donc vous ne l'abandonnerez pas. Votre salaire augmentera et vous n'abandonnerez pas Dieu. Vous continuerez toujours à faire la justice. Pour certaines personnes, lorsque vous conduisez une bonne voiture, ils l'interprètent comme signifiant que vous gaspillez l'argent de Dieu. Quelqu'un est venu me raconter un rêve mais je lui ai donné une autre interprétation. Il a dit : « Pasteur, j'ai rêvé que des gens venaient de l'étranger et t'avaient acheté un gros avion et qu'ils avaient aussi ajouté un hélicoptère. Ils ont dit que l'avion est pour vous d'aller de nation en nation tandis que l'hélicoptère est de se déplacer de village en village. Louez le Seigneur ! J'ai dit, d'accord, je comprends. Le Seigneur dit que j'irai de nation en nation et Il m'aidera aussi à aller de village en village. Cependant, s'ils apportent cet avion, dirai-je « Non » ? Pas du tout, car nous ne connaissons pas le plan de Dieu. **\n2.5 Vous avez défié Dieu avec la sainteté, il vous défiera avec sa bénédiction. **\nGenèse 22 verset 15 à 18 **\n\t\"Et l'ange du Seigneur appela Abraham du ciel une seconde fois,\n\tEt dit : J'ai juré par moi-même, dit l'Éternel, parce que tu as fait cette chose, et que tu n'as pas refusé ton fils, ton fils unique ;\nQu'en bénissant je te bénirai, et en multipliant je multiplierai ta postérité comme les étoiles du ciel, et comme le sable qui est sur le bord de la mer ; et ta postérité possédera la porte de ses ennemis;\n\tEt en ta postérité toutes les nations de la terre seront bénies; parce que tu as obéi à ma voix. ” **\nJe dis, préparez-vous. Nous avons défié Dieu avec sainteté; sûrement, Il nous défiera avec Sa bénédiction. Le Seigneur a dit à Salomon qu'il ne demandait ni richesse ni honneur ; il a plutôt demandé de la sagesse pour gouverner le peuple de Dieu afin d'apporter la gloire à Dieu. La réponse de Dieu fut : « Maintenant, richesses, honneur, gloire et tout, je t'ai ajouté. Quelqu'un peut-il dire à Dieu de l'arrêter? Il le fait pour lui-même et pour sa gloire. Je te prépare parce que, qui sait, demain tu deviendras peut-être un grand leader politique de la nation. Cela ne devrait pas vous surprendre car Dieu veut réfuter les pécheurs qui ont relégué son nom au second plan et attaché la misère à ses enfants. Il dit donc : « Non, je suis le propriétaire du monde et le créateur de toutes choses ». Il dit : « La richesse et l'honneur sont avec Moi. Par moi, les rois règnent et les princes décrètent la justice. Adorez simplement Dieu. Il a promis de rendre droits vos sentiers, de niveler votre colline et de préparer une route sur laquelle ses enfants pourront marcher. Ses enfants vont passer par cette autoroute. Il dit : « Je prépare une route de justice ; une autoroute de richesses; une autoroute de la richesse et une autoroute de l'honneur. Vous marcherez dessus. Alléluia, amen. Pleurez pour la sagesse. Priez pour cela. Juste une idée qui tombera dans votre cœur fera la différence. Le Seigneur est le propriétaire des idées créatrices. Il dit : « Moi, la sagesse habite avec la prudence, et découvre la connaissance des inventions spirituelles. J'habite la sagesse avec l'intelligence et j'apporte la découverte. Le Seigneur vous donnera des idées et vous allez progresser. Les gens viendront se tenir devant vous. Les gens viendront vous consulter en raison des découvertes et des inventions que vous ferez. Son nom sera promu dans votre vie. Alléluia! **\nPremières Chroniques 1 verset 9 à 10 **\n\t« Et les fils de Cusch ; Seba, et Havilah, et Sabta, et Ramah, et Sabtecha. Et les fils de Ramah ; Sheba et Dedan.\n\tEt Cush engendra Nimrod : il commença à être puissant sur la terre. ” **\nIl n'est pas facile de prêcher l'évangile aux églises évangéliques et à certaines églises orthodoxes. Cependant, le Seigneur dans sa miséricorde a fait en sorte qu'un de nos frères ait une influence politique sur environ six ou sept gouvernements locaux dans son état. Je lui ai alors dit : « Remerciez Dieu pour l'autorité qu'il vous a donnée sur le peuple. En votre autorité et en votre faveur, pourriez-vous dire à tous les ministres de l'évangile de votre communauté de se réunir pour une conférence chrétienne ? **\nTout d'abord, il a invité les ministres chez lui pour un déjeuner. Environ deux cents pasteurs se sont réunis et j'étais là pour leur transmettre la parole de Dieu. Certains étaient d'anciens prédicateurs; certains ont commencé à prêcher, peut-être avant ma naissance ou peut-être quand j'étais encore un petit garçon. **\nLa sagesse m'a donné l'occasion de leur prêcher. La sagesse le fera aussi dans votre vie. Ce n'était pas tout. Ce n'était que la première étape. Je lui ai demandé d'envoyer une autre invitation demandant que tous les ministres avec leurs anciens viennent pour une conférence dans un centre de gouvernement local et qu'il les transporte, les héberge et les nourrisse. Nous leur prêcherions la parole de Dieu et mettrions entre leurs mains des documents inspirés de l'évangile. Au moment où cette invitation est sortie, sept cents ministres de l'évangile étaient réunis. Nous y sommes allés et leur avons prêché. Nous avons enregistré les messages et les avons remis entre leurs mains. Les livres que nous avons apportés ont été partagés avec chacun d'eux. Alléluia! Supposons que le Seigneur fasse d'un tel frère le gouverneur ou le président du Nigéria, ce serait trop grand et merveilleux ! Nous allons simplement applaudir dans nos mains que le temps du réveil est venu dans l'état ou la nation. **\nDeuxième Timothée 1 verset 16 à 18 **\n\t« Que le Seigneur fasse miséricorde à la maison d'Onésiphore ; car il m'a souvent rafraîchi, et n'a pas eu honte de ma chaîne;\n\tMais, quand il était à Rome, il m'a cherché très diligemment et m'a trouvé.\n\tQue le Seigneur lui accorde qu'il puisse trouver miséricorde du Seigneur en ce jour-là: et en combien de choses il m'a servi à Éphèse, tu le sais très bien '' **\ndeuxième Jean verset 8 et 12 **\n« Assurez-vous que nous ne perdons pas les choses que nous avons faites, mais que nous recevons une pleine récompense.\nAyant beaucoup de choses à vous écrire, je n'écrirais pas avec du papier et de l'encre, mais j'espère venir à vous et vous parler face à face, afin que notre joie soit parfaite. **\n \nC'est pourquoi le Seigneur est intéressé à vous promouvoir. Quand Il vous promeut, Dieu sera glorifié et promu aux yeux des hommes par vous. En étant promu, vous élevez Jésus. Tout ce que fait le Seigneur, il le fait dans sa sagesse et pour sa gloire. Demandez la sagesse; demander des idées. Cela fera une différence dans votre vie. Votre église stagnante fleurira. Les gens qui ne viennent pas commenceront à accourir. Demandez à Dieu de vous dire quoi faire. Laissez-le vous dire comment s'y prendre. Laissez-le vous dire le style d'évangélisation que vous devez utiliser. Laissez-le vous dire les étapes et les processus à suivre. C'est un Dieu des idées. Je la sagesse habite avec la prudence, et découvre la connaissance des inventions spirituelles. (Proverbes 8 verset 12). Il a dit : « Demandez, et l'on vous donnera ; cherchez et vous trouverez; frappez, et on vous ouvrira. (Matthieu 7 verset 7). Le Seigneur change les gens cette fois-ci; votre mentalité va changer. **\ndeuxième Chroniques 1 verset 6 à 12 **\n\t« Et Salomon monta là vers l'autel d'airain devant l'Éternel, qui était au tabernacle d'assignation, et offrit dessus mille holocaustes.\n\tCette nuit-là, Dieu apparut à Salomon et lui dit : Demande ce que je te donnerai.\n\tEt Salomon dit à Dieu : Tu as fait preuve d'une grande miséricorde envers David, mon père, et tu m'as fait régner à sa place.\n\tMaintenant, Seigneur Dieu, que ta promesse à David, mon père, soit établie ; car tu m'as établi roi sur un peuple comme la poussière de la terre en multitude.\n\tDonne-moi maintenant la sagesse et la connaissance afin que je puisse sortir et entrer devant ce peuple , car qui peut juger ce ton peuple qui est si grand ?\n\tEt Dieu dit à Salomon, parce que cela était dans ton cœur, et que tu n'as pas demandé la richesse, la richesse ou l'honneur, ni la vie de tes ennemis, et que tu n'as pas encore demandé la longue vie ; mais tu as demandé la sagesse et la connaissance pour toi-même, afin que tu puisses juger mon peuple, sur lequel je t'ai établi roi.\n\tLa sagesse et la connaissance t'ont été accordées ; et je te donnerai des richesses, des richesses et des honneurs, comme n'en ont eu aucun des rois qui ont été avant toi, et aucun après toi n'en aura de semblable. **\nIl y avait un pasteur particulier dans les années 80. A cette époque, il était considéré comme un gaspillage d'argent d'avoir une moquette dans sa maison. C'était comme gaspiller de l'argent qui aurait été utilisé pour l'œuvre de l'évangile. Avoir un tapis ou un coussin de chaise était très rare. Lorsque certains membres de l'église ont visité sa maison et ont vu des coussins et des tapis, ils ont conclu que l'homme avait rétrogradé et était parti dans le monde. Pendant ce temps, il est arrivé que le pasteur ait reçu les articles en cadeau. Lorsqu'une entreprise les vendait aux enchères, quelqu'un les achetait et demandait au pasteur s'il en avait besoin. Le pasteur accepta et ils les emmenèrent chez lui. Le rapport parvint à leur quartier général que l'homme avait rétrogradé. Le quartier général, ignorant les promesses de Dieu et manquant de compréhension de sa volonté, a placé le pasteur sous la discipline. Ils ne savaient pas que Dieu n'est pas un Dieu de pauvreté. Ils n'ont pas compris que Dieu veut bénir son peuple. Ils n'ont pas compris que les richesses de la terre lui appartiennent. Il a dit \"Je te donnerai les richesses des lieux cachés\". **\n \nJe prie pour que le Seigneur change votre mentalité. Vous saurez que Dieu veut que vous ayez les bénédictions de la vie. Que Dieu veut que vous progressiez ; et pour que vous sachiez qu'il y a des gens alignés derrière vous qui attendent de puiser dans votre bénédiction. Ils attendent que vous les bénissiez et que vous amélioriez leur vie. Par vos actes de charité qui en feront entrer beaucoup dans le Royaume de Dieu. Merci Jésus. Vous obtenez la sagesse par la prière. **\nJacques 1 verset 5 **\n« Si l'un de vous manque de sagesse, qu'il la demande à Dieu, qui donne à tous simplement et sans reproche ; et il lui sera donné ». **\nÉlevez votre voix pour comprendre. Prenez le temps de jeûner et de prier Dieu pour des idées progressistes, des idées transformatrices. Demandez-le à Dieu, il vous le donnera. Il ouvrira votre cerveau et le mettra là. Vous vous épanouirez. **\npremier Timothée 6 versets 17 à 19 **\n\t« Recommandez aux riches de ce monde de ne pas être élevés d'esprit, ni de se fier à des richesses incertaines, mais au Dieu vivant, qui nous donne richement toutes choses pour en jouir ;\n\tQu'ils fassent le bien, qu'ils soient riches en bonnes œuvres, prêts à distribuer, désireux de communiquer ;\n\tSe préparant une bonne fondation pour le temps à venir, afin qu'ils puissent s'emparer de la vie éternelle. ” **\n \nCHAPITRE TROIS **\nOBTENEZ DE BONS CONSEILS POUR VOTRE RÉUSSITE **\n\nDeuxième Samuel 16 verset 23 **\n\"Et le conseil d'Achitophel, qu'il conseillait en ces jours-là, était comme si un homme avait interrogé l'oracle de Dieu: ainsi en fut tout le conseil d'Achitophel, tant avec David qu'avec Absalom.\" **\n3.1 Demander conseil pour éviter la chute **\nJe veux que vous sachiez que l'avocat est important. Le Seigneur vous ordonne de demander conseil. Beaucoup d'entre vous font leurs choses sans conseil et c'est pourquoi vous échouez. Vous supposez que vous êtes tout puissant en vous-même ; prendre des décisions sans contacter quelqu'un et sans dire: \"Dieu, j'ai besoin de tes conseils, j'ai besoin de plus d'idées.\" Dieu vous dirigera vers quelqu'un de plus expérimenté que vous en la matière. La personne vous dira quoi faire. Lorsque Dieu a appelé l'apôtre Paul, il lui a demandé d'aller dans la ville où il trouverait un homme qui lui dirait quoi faire. Mais vous ne voulez vous référer à aucun homme ; vous ne voyez aucun homme; vous prenez simplement une chose et vous la faites. Vous vous lancez dans n'importe quelle entreprise et vous n'avez qu'à aller de l'avant. C'est pourquoi vous échouez. **\n \nProverbes 11 verset 14 **\n\"Là où il n'y a pas de conseil, le peuple tombe, mais dans la multitude des conseillers il y a la sécurité.\" **\nPouvez-vous voir pourquoi vous avez échoué plusieurs fois ? C'est parce que vous n'avez pas demandé conseil. Tout ce qui vous vient à l'esprit, vous allez simplement de l'avant pour l'exécuter sans prier pour être guidé. Vous allez de l'avant sans demander conseil pour savoir si la pensée dans votre esprit est correcte ou non. Tu n'aurais pas dû faire ça. Dans l'église, vous avez votre pasteur mais vous ne prenez pas la peine de le voir pour un conseil. C'est la raison pour laquelle vous échouez. Proverbes 15 verset 22\nSans conseil les buts sont déçus : mais dans la multitude des conseillers, ils sont établis.\nVous voulez vous marier ? Pas de conseil ; aucun conseil. Qui que vous choisissiez, vous allez vous marier. C'est votre style. Vous avez fait un rêve et vous vous êtes réveillé pour aller réaliser ce dont vous rêviez. Qui vous a dit que le Seigneur avait parlé dans ce rêve ? Vous n'avez pas pris la peine de vérifier. C'est pourquoi vous avez échoué. Le diable vous obtient à bon marché. Votre esprit est si simple que vous vous laissez facilement emporter. C'est pourquoi Dieu vous demande de le vérifier en conseillant ; par une multitude de conseillers. Même dans les affaires laïques, il existe des spécialistes dans divers domaines dont vous avez besoin de leurs conseils sur la façon dont une chose doit être faite. Ce sont des gens formés; ils sont appris; ils ont une compréhension dans ce domaine et vous devez les consulter pour recevoir des conseils suffisants. S'il en est ainsi dans le monde séculier, combien plus en Christ ? Une idée vous vient à l'esprit et vous voulez partir et démarrer un ministère ? Vous venez de vous déplacer sans consultations auprès de personnes supérieures à vous pour poser des questions sur vos rêves et vos sentiments ? Vous avez peut-être rêvé que vous prêchiez devant une multitude et vous pensez que c'est un appel au ministère de la prédication. Vous n'avez pas demandé conseil, mais vous êtes juste allé de l'avant, vous êtes tombé et vous êtes allé en enfer ! Là où il n'y a pas de conseil, le peuple tombe : mais dans la multitude des conseillers il y a la sécurité. **\n \nProverbes 20 verset 18 **\n\"Tout but est établi par un conseil, et avec de bons conseils, faites la guerre\".\nChaque but ; ministérielle, familiale, conjugale, commerciale ; chaque fin est établie par un avocat. Nous vos pasteurs sommes là pour vous. Ne vous contentez pas de vous lever et de vous lancer dans une entreprise sans conseil ou simplement de prendre votre sac et de voyager sans que personne ne le sache. Ce n'est pas la pensée de Dieu pour vous; ce n'est pas une vie chrétienne. L'avocat est important. C'est la volonté de Dieu pour votre vie. **\n3.2 Cherchez de bons conseillers pour votre réussite **\nDeuxième Samuel 16 verset 23 **\n\"Et le conseil d'Achitophel, qu'il conseillait en ces jours-là, était comme si un homme avait interrogé l'oracle de Dieu, ainsi en était-il de tout le conseil d'Achitophel, tant avec David qu'avec Absalom.\" **\nLe conseil d'Achitophel était parfait. C'était comme si vous alliez rencontrer Dieu et que vous vous asseyiez avec lui et que vous lui demandiez de vous dire si ce dans quoi vous voulez vous aventurer fonctionnera. Si Achitophel vous a dit \"Non\", ne le faites pas.\" C'était comme si Dieu vous parlait. Son conseil était tout simplement parfait ! Tout ce qu'Achitophel vous conseillait de faire, c'était exactement comme Dieu parlait. Dieu a mis sa sagesse dans les gens pour votre bien. Il a accordé à certaines personnes la possibilité de recevoir une formation ou d'acquérir des compétences au service de l'humanité. Dieu met des dons dans les gens. Il a donné aux gens divers dons et formations pour votre bien. Alors, pourquoi ne les consultez-vous pas ? Des problèmes se passent dans votre famille entre vous et votre conjoint et vous ne consultez pas ceux qui savent mieux comment les résoudre ? Depuis dix ans, vous n'êtes jamais en paix avec votre conjoint, mais vous n'êtes jamais allé consulter pour savoir quoi faire. Vous restez là dans les ténèbres en attendant de mourir et d'aller en enfer alors que les gens autour de vous ne sont pas conscients de ce que vous traversez. Peut-être que vous et votre conjoint dormez sur le même lit mais faites face à des directions différentes. Quelle est la raison de ceci? Avez-vous demandé conseil ? Peut-être que votre propre histoire est que votre femme vous méprise. Mais avez-vous demandé conseil pour savoir ce que vous devriez faire ou ce que vous faites que vous devriez cesser de faire ? Avez-vous essayé cela? Avez-vous vu l'homme de Dieu? :**\npremier Samuel 9 verset 6, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19 à 20 **\n\t« Et il lui dit : Voici, il y a dans cette ville un homme de Dieu, et c'est un homme honorable ; tout ce qu'il dit s'accomplira sûrement, allons-y maintenant; peut-être pourra-t-il nous indiquer la voie à suivre.\n\tAlors Saül dit à son serviteur : Mais voici, si nous partons, que lui apporterons-nous ? car le pain est dépensé dans nos vases, et il n'y a pas de présent à apporter à l'homme de Dieu : qu'avons-nous ?\n\tEt le serviteur répondit de nouveau à Saül, et dit: Voici, j'ai ici sous la main le quart d'un sicle d'argent; je le donnerai à l'homme de Dieu, pour qu'il nous indique notre chemin.\n\t(Auparavant, en Israël, lorsqu'un homme allait s'enquérir de Dieu, il parlait ainsi : Venez, et allons chez le voyant ; car celui qui est maintenant appelé prophète était auparavant appelé voyant.)\n\tAlors dit Saül à son serviteur, bien dit; venez, partons. Ils allèrent donc à la ville où se trouvait l'homme de Dieu.\n\tOr le Seigneur avait dit à Samuel à l'oreille un jour avant l'arrivée de Saül, disant :\n\tDemain, à cette heure, je t'enverrai un homme du pays de Benjamin, et tu l'oindras pour être le chef de mon peuple d'Israël, afin qu'il délivre mon peuple de la main des Philistins, car j'ai regardé mon gens, parce que leur cri est venu jusqu'à moi.\n\tEt Samuel répondit à Saül, et dit : Je suis le voyant ; monte devant moi au haut lieu ; car aujourd'hui tu mangeras avec moi, et demain je te laisserai partir, et je te dirai tout ce qui est dans ton coeur.\n\tEt quant à tes ânes qui se sont perdus il y a trois jours, ne t'occupe pas d'eux; car ils se trouvent. Et sur qui est tout le désir d'Israël? N'est-ce pas sur toi et sur toute la maison de ton père ? ” **\nÀ Jos, dans l'État du Plateau au Nigeria, un homme a rendu visite à son ami à l'hôpital qui était médecin. Il lui dit : « Docteur, je mets maintenant de l'ordre dans ma maison car je sais que je vais bientôt mourir. Le docteur a demandé: \"Qu'est-ce qui ne va pas avec vous?\" Il a dit: «J'ai une douleur aiguë dans la poitrine qui me brûle sérieusement. Nous avons prié et jeûné et tout fait et je sais qu'il n'y a pas de solution à cela. Alors je sais que je vais bientôt mourir. Au fil de la conversation, le Docteur a commencé à préparer Mist Mag Solution. Il a demandé à savoir quelle préparation son ami faisait pour sa mort et il a commencé à lui expliquer. Alors que la conversation se poursuivait, le médecin lui a donné le médicament à boire. Après quelques minutes, le médecin lui a demandé comment il se sentait. L'ami a répondu que je suis surpris, la douleur a commencé à diminuer et je ne mourrai peut-être plus. **\nPsaume 118 verset 15 à 17 **\n« La voix de la joie et du salut est dans les tabernacles des justes ; la droite du Seigneur fait vaillamment.\nLa droite de l'Éternel est élevée; la droite de l'Éternel fait vaillamment. **\nJe ne mourrai pas, mais je vivrai, et j'annoncerai les oeuvres du Seigneur.\nVous avez un cas et vous avez refusé de consulter ceux qui s'y connaissent mieux. Pensez-vous que Dieu n'a qu'une approche à sens unique pour résoudre les problèmes ? Certains d'entre vous appartiennent à ces églises qui disent qu'il ne faut pas prendre de drogue. Ils vous disent de ne pas aller à l'hôpital parce que le médecin est un incroyant. C'est l'obscurité ! Le malade cherche des médecins pour se faire soigner ; mais vous dites que vous ne prendrez pas de drogue et vous êtes en train de mourir parce que vous avez refusé de prendre conseil. La Bible dit : « Là où il n'y a pas de conseil, le peuple périt. Le conseil d'Achitophel à cette époque était comme si un homme consultait un oracle. Avez-vous eu une telle expérience où quelqu'un vous a donné un conseil et cela a parfaitement fonctionné ? Oui bien sûr! Pourquoi devriez-vous garder votre problème pour vous et périr dans votre situation parce que vous avez trop honte de laisser une autre personne entendre votre histoire ? Vous voulez garder votre secret et le Seigneur dit : « Non, dis-le à quelqu'un ! Vous priez pour que Dieu le fasse pour vous en privé, mais il vous demande de le dire à quelqu'un et d'enterrer votre orgueil. **\nMatthieu 11 verset 28 à 29 **\n\t« Venez à moi, vous tous qui êtes fatigués et chargés, et je vous donnerai du repos.\n\tPrenez mon joug sur vous, et apprenez de moi ; car je suis doux et humble de cœur ; et vous trouverez du repos pour vos âmes. **\n \nProverbes 22 verset 4 **\n« C'est par l'humilité et la crainte du Seigneur que naissent les richesses, l'honneur et la vie. » **\n \n3.3 Les conseillers sont les dons de Dieu pour votre bien-être **\n1 Corinthiens 3 versets 22 à 23 **\n« Soit Paul, soit Apollos, soit Céphas, soit le monde, soit la vie, soit la mort, soit les choses présentes, soit les choses à venir ; tout est à vous;\nEt vous êtes à Christ; et Christ est à Dieu. **\nDeuxième Rois 5 versets 2 à 5, 14 **\n\t« Et les Syriens étaient sortis par compagnies, et avaient emmené captive du pays d'Israël une petite fille ; et elle servit la femme de Naaman.\n\tEt elle dit à sa maîtresse : Dieu mon seigneur serait-il avec le prophète qui est à Samarie ! car il le guérirait de sa lèpre.\n\tEt quelqu'un entra, et dit à son maître, disant : Ainsi et ainsi a dit la servante qui est du pays d'Israël.\n\tEt le roi de Syrie dit : Allez, allez, et j'enverrai une lettre au roi d'Israël. Et il partit, et prit avec lui dix talents d'argent, et six mille pièces d'or, et dix vêtements de rechange.\nPuis il descendit et se plongea sept fois dans le Jourdain, selon la parole de l'homme de Dieu ; et sa chair revint comme la chair d'un petit enfant, et il fut pur. **\nUne servante d'Israël a servi la femme de Naaman. Quand elle vit la lèpre de son maître, elle dit à sa femme : « Dieu, mon seigneur, serait-il avec le prophète qui est à Samarie ! car il le guérirait de sa lèpre. Ils ont pris conseil. Naaman est allé à Samarie et a été dirigé vers Elisée. Élisée lui envoya des messagers pour qu'il aille au Jourdain et s'y plonge sept fois et qu'il soit guéri. L'homme était en colère comme s'il devait voir Elisée et le frapper. \"Un grand homme comme moi, suis-je idiot d'aller me jeter à l'eau comme si j'étais un enfant.\" Dans sa colère, il envisagea de retourner en Syrie. Puis un autre conseiller est arrivé. Ses serviteurs s'approchèrent et dirent : mon maître, si l'homme de Dieu t'avait dit de faire quelque chose de plus grand, ne l'aurais-tu pas fait ? Qu'est-ce que cela vous coûte d'aller vous tremper sept fois dans l'eau ? Nous ne voyons pas la raison de votre colère. Ce conseil le calma. Il a dit \"D'accord, où est le fleuve, Jordan?\" Et ils allèrent au fleuve Jourdain. Il est entré dans la rivière et en est ressorti sept fois. Je pense qu'il a peut-être calculé ce qu'il ferait après avoir terminé et rien ne s'est passé. Peut-être que la nation d'Israël dans son ensemble en aurait subi les conséquences. Mais à la septième fois, il s'est émerveillé du miracle qui s'est produit. Son corps est devenu complètement propre et exempt de lèpre séculaire. **\n \nJérémie 30 verset 17 **\n« Car je te rendrai la santé, et je te guérirai de tes blessures, dit le Seigneur ; parce qu'ils t'ont traité de paria, en disant : C'est Sion, que personne ne recherche. **\nHumiliez-vous et prenez conseil; humiliez-vous et demandez conseil sur le désordre de votre vie. Votre problème peut être le défi de procréer ou de trouver un partenaire de mariage. Peut-être que votre propre problème concerne l'échec de l'entreprise ou le chômage. Obtenez des conseils. Dieu vous encourage à suivre ce conseil ; croyez-le et faites-le ! Naomi a donné des conseils à Ruth. Elle lui a donné des conseils sur la façon d'obtenir un mari. Boaz est votre plus proche parent, faites ce que je vous ai dit et revenez me dire le résultat. Le conseil a travaillé pour Ruth dans la justice et la sainteté. Toi aussi, prends conseil ; prendre conseil. Certains d'entre vous pensent à un homme en particulier pour le mariage. Pour vous, si vous n'épousez pas cet homme, vous ne vous remarierez pas. Qui t'as dit ça? Voulez-vous mourir? La déception que vous avez eue était une déception de la vie. C'était Dieu qui vous a sauvé d'épouser une mauvaise personne et vous dites que Dieu doit vous donner cet homme ou que Dieu doit vous donner cette femme ? Que veux-tu dire par là? Comprenez la parole de Dieu dans votre déception persistante dans ce domaine. **\n \nRomains 8 verset 28. **\n« Et nous savons que toutes choses concourent au bien de ceux qui aiment Dieu, de ceux qui sont appelés selon son dessein. »\nPeut-être que votre propre cas est que différents hommes sont venus vous chercher mais vous les avez rejetés. Soyez prudent car le Seigneur les empêchera de venir. Ne transformez pas cette chose en orgueil. Il y a des gens plus beaux qui n'ont jamais vu un homme demander leur main en mariage, mais vous abusez de votre chance. Si vous continuez ainsi, le Seigneur récompensera votre orgueil. Humiliez-vous. Avant de dire « Non », que ce soit Dieu qui parle en vous et non que vous méprisiez un enfant de Dieu. Vous les avez peut-être rejetés parce que vous les considérez comme inférieurs à vous. Qui t'as dit ça? Vous connaissez-vous ou connaissez-vous votre rang ? Qui est votre égal ? Est-ce Satan ? Humiliez-vous. Ne méprisez aucun homme. Ne méprise pas les jours de petit commencement. Prenez conseil. Si vous n'êtes pas clair au sujet de vos rêves, allez consulter des personnes mûres qui peuvent interpréter correctement votre rêve. Laissez-les vous donner des conseils afin que vous ne perdiez pas toutes vos opportunités et que personne ne revienne vous chercher. **\n  \nExode 18 verset 13 à 24 **\n\t« Et il arriva que le lendemain Moïse s'assit pour juger le peuple ; et le peuple se tenait près de Moïse depuis le matin jusqu'au soir.\n\tEt quand le beau-père de Moïse vit tout ce qu'il faisait au peuple, il dit : Quelle est cette chose que tu fais au peuple ? Pourquoi t'es-tu assis seul, et tout le peuple se tient-il près de toi du matin au soir ?\n\tEt Moïse dit à son beau-père, parce que le peuple vient à moi pour s'enquérir de Dieu;\n\tQuand ils ont une affaire, ils viennent à moi ; et je juge entre les uns et les autres, et je leur fais connaître les statuts de Dieu et ses lois.\n\tEt le beau-père de Moïse lui dit : La chose que tu fais n'est pas bonne.\n\tTu t'épuiseras sûrement, toi et ce peuple qui est avec toi, car cette chose est trop lourde pour toi; tu n'es pas capable de l'accomplir toi-même seul.\n\tÉcoute maintenant ma voix, je te donnerai un conseil, et Dieu sera avec toi. Sois pour le peuple vers Dieu, afin que tu apportes les causes à Dieu.\n\tEt tu leur enseigneras les ordonnances et les lois, et tu leur montreras le chemin dans lequel ils doivent marcher, et le travail qu'ils doivent faire.\n\tDe plus, tu fourniras de tout le peuple des hommes capables, craignant Dieu, des hommes véridiques, haïssant la convoitise ; et placez-les au-dessus d'eux, pour qu'ils soient chefs de milliers, chefs de centaines, chefs de cinquante et chefs de dizaines.\n\tEt qu'ils jugent le peuple en toute saison, et il arrivera qu'ils t'apporteront toute grande affaire, mais ils jugeront toute petite affaire. Ainsi cela te sera plus facile, et ils porteront le fardeau avec toi.\n\tSi tu fais cela, et que Dieu te l'ordonne, alors tu pourras endurer, et tout ce peuple ira aussi chez lui en paix.\n\tAlors Moïse écouta la voix de son beau-père, et fit tout ce qu'il avait dit. ” **\n \nLe beau-père de Moïse a donné des conseils pour alléger le fardeau de Moïse. Il vit que Moïse conseillait le peuple du matin au soir. Il savait que cela l'épuiserait. Dieu donne protection et grâce mais il y a des lois naturelles qu'il ne voudra pas enfreindre. Alors soyez prudent, utilisez la sagesse. Partagez le travail pour que vous puissiez vivre longtemps. Aussi, pour que ceux qui vous attendent ne soient pas épuisés par les longues heures que vous les faites attendre. Ce conseil donné par le beau-père de Moïse a fonctionné ! Demandez conseil, ne soyez pas fier. L'orgueil est la raison de votre chute. Là où est la fierté, il y a une chute. La fierté précède la chute. Soyez humble pour prendre des conseils. **\n \nProverbes 10 verset 4 **\n\"Celui qui traite avec une main lâche devient pauvre, mais la main du diligent enrichit.\" **\nProverbes 29 verset 23 **\n« L'orgueil d'un homme l'abaissera ; mais l'honneur soutiendra les humbles d'esprit. :**\n3.4 Prendre conseil auprès de l'homme de Dieu **\nMalachie 2 verset 4 à 7 **\n\t« Et vous saurez que je vous ai envoyé ce commandement, afin que mon alliance soit avec Lévi, dit l'Éternel des armées.\n\tMon alliance était avec lui de vie et de paix; et je les lui ai donnés parce qu'il me craignait et avait peur devant mon nom.\n\tLa loi de la vérité était dans sa bouche, et l'iniquité n'a pas été trouvée dans ses lèvres, il a marché avec moi dans la paix et l'équité, et a détourné beaucoup de l'iniquité.\n\tCar les lèvres du sacrificateur doivent garder la connaissance, et ils doivent rechercher la loi de sa bouche, car il est le messager de l'Éternel des armées . **\nDieu met Ses paroles dans la bouche de Ses ministres oints. Ils ne savent peut-être même rien. C'est quand vous viendrez que Dieu vous parlera à travers eux. Ils sont l'oracle de Dieu. Allez vers eux. Pourquoi écartez-vous vos ministres qui sont oints, saints et justes et faites-vous les choses de toute façon ? Le prêtre garde la connaissance en attente pour vous; la loi du Seigneur est dans sa bouche. Si vous voulez connaître la volonté de Dieu, allez lui demander. Dites-lui à quoi vous pensez et il vous dira la pensée de Dieu. Dès que vous lui parlerez, le Seigneur lui indiquera quoi vous dire. Dieu vous attend pour votre bien. **\nDeuxième Rois 3 versets 11 à 12 **\n\t« Mais Josaphat dit : n'y a-t-il pas ici un prophète du Seigneur pour que nous interrogeions le Seigneur par lui ? Et l'un des serviteurs du roi d'Israël répondit et dit: Voici Elisée, fils de Shaphat, qui a versé de l'eau sur les mains d'Elie.\n\tEt Josaphat dit : la parole de l'Éternel est avec lui. Ainsi le roi d'Israël et Josaphat et le roi d'Edom descendirent vers lui. ” **\n \nAUJOURD'HUI EST VOTRE JOUR DE CHANGEMENT **\nHébreux 11 verset 1 à 3 **\n« Or la foi est la fermeté des choses qu'on espère, la preuve de celles qu'on ne voit pas.\n\tCar par elle les anciens ont obtenu un bon rapport.\n\tPar la foi, nous comprenons que les mondes ont été encadrés par la parole de Dieu, de sorte que les choses qui se voient ne sont pas faites de choses qui apparaissent. ” **\nSi vous convenez aujourd'hui que votre vie ne sera plus la même. Pour beaucoup de ceux qui sont en retard dans l'éducation, Dieu ouvrira la voie et vous inscrira dans une école. La puissance de Dieu travaillera pour vous et vous inscrira dans cette université dans laquelle vous rêviez d'être admis. Décidez que vous ne serez plus au chômage et la porte s'ouvrira pour vous. Vous valez mieux que les quatre lépreux. Le Seigneur les suivit pour leur frayer un chemin. Il a même chassé de puissantes armées pour eux. Le Seigneur ira avec vous et fera des merveilles pour votre vie. Ne craignez aucun barrage routier car le Seigneur supprimera ce blocage. Le Seigneur enlèvera cette chose qui bloquait la route. Cette maladie sera enlevée parce que vous avez décidé que vous ne serez plus le même. **\n  \nIsa iah 10 verset 13 **\n« Car il dit : Je l'ai fait par la force de ma main et par ma sagesse ; car je suis prudent, et j'ai déplacé les limites du peuple, et j'ai pillé ses trésors, et j'ai abattu les habitants comme un homme vaillant: \" **\nLe fils prodigue dit : « Je me lèverai et j'irai vers mon père. Je ne mangerai plus le pain de la douleur. Je continue maintenant avec une vie changée et le Seigneur dit : « Amen » à cela. Bientôt, le Seigneur libérera un peuple qu'il a gradué vers le succès. Lorsque vous entrez dans votre maison, regardez le lit sur lequel vous vous êtes allongé et dites au revoir à la compagnie de rats qui ont lutté pour trouver de l'espace avec vous sur ce lit la nuit parce que ce lit sera changé. Le Seigneur vous donnera un lit plus grand. Vous roulerez d'un bout à l'autre. Le Seigneur vous comblera de bonnes choses. Commencez à vous réjouir que votre vie ne soit plus la même. Le seigneur vous donnera des idées de progrès. La prospérité viendra à votre rencontre. Vous mangerez en abondance et serez rassasiés et louerez le nom de Dieu qui a fait des merveilles pour votre vie. Amen. **\nDeuxième Chroniques 20 verset 20 **\n« Et ils se levèrent de bon matin, et sortirent dans le désert de Tekoa ; et comme ils sortaient, Josaphat se présenta et dit: Écoutez-moi, Juda et habitants de Jérusalem! Croyez au Seigneur votre Dieu, ainsi serez-vous affermis; croyez ses prophètes, ainsi vous prospérerez. ” **\n \nLuc 5 verset 1 à 7 **\n\t« Et il arriva que, comme le peuple le pressait pour entendre la parole de Dieu, il se tint près du lac de Génésareth,\n\tEt vit deux navires debout près du lac , mais les pêcheurs en étaient sortis et lavaient leurs filets.\n\tEt il monta dans l'une des barques, qui appartenait à Simon, et le pria de s'éloigner un peu de la terre. Et il s'assit et enseigna le peuple hors de la barque.\n\tLorsqu'il eut fini de parler, il dit à Simon, lance-toi dans l'abîme, et jette tes filets pour boire.\n\tEt Simon, répondant, lui dit : Maître, nous avons peiné toute la nuit, et nous n'avons rien pris ; néanmoins, sur ta parole, je jetterai le filet.\n\tEt quand ils eurent fait cela, ils enfermèrent une grande multitude de poissons ; et leur frein net.\n\tEt ils firent signe à leurs compagnons, qui étaient dans l'autre bateau, de venir les aider. Et ils vinrent, et remplirent les deux navires, de sorte qu'ils commencèrent à couler. ” **\n",

      "body": "LA DOCTRINE DU MARIAGE CHRÉTIEN POUR UNE PRATIQUE UNIFORME **\n\nPASTEUR PAUL RIKA **\n\nLe plus grand plaisir des hommes et des femmes sur terre est Jésus-Christ. Connaître Jésus et vivre avec lui est la chose la plus excellente qu'un homme ou une femme puisse obtenir sur terre. Aimez Jésus plus qu'un homme, une femme ou un enfant. Aimez Jésus plus que votre femme, votre mari et votre enfant. Désir de vivre avec Jésus au ciel pour toujours. **\nLes proverbes. 8 versets 35 et 36 **\n« Car quiconque me trouve trouve la vie et obtient la faveur du Seigneur.\nMais celui qui pèche contre moi fait tort à son âme, tous ceux qui me haïssent aiment la mort ». **\nPhilippiens 3 verset 8 **\n« Oui, sans aucun doute, et je considère tout comme une perte pour l'excellence de la connaissance de Jésus-Christ mon Seigneur, pour qui j'ai souffert la perte de toutes choses, et je ne les considère que comme du fumier, afin de gagner Christ » **\n \nLAISSEZ JESUS VOUS GUIDER A QUI VOUS DEVRIEZ VOUS MARIER **\nLorsque vous choisissez de servir Dieu et d'obéir à sa parole, le Seigneur vous aimera aussi et s'intéressera à vous pour faire de bonnes choses pour votre vie. Cela vous encouragera à continuer à lui obéir. Repentez-vous de vos péchés, obéissez et servez le Seigneur Jésus-Christ. Alors demandez-lui un partenaire de mariage convenable et bon pour vous-même et vous serez surpris du don béni d'un partenaire de mariage qu'il vous donnera. Prov. 19 verset 14. Les enfants de Dieu ne doivent pas épouser des non-croyants. Les incroyants sont des gens qui vivent encore dans le péché. Certains appartiennent à d'autres religions, tandis que d'autres sont chrétiens de religion, mais sont désobéissants et impies. Vous pouvez les connaître par leur style de vie et leur tenue diabolique. Demandez bien à connaître la vie chrétienne de la personne. **\n2 Corinthiens 6 versets 14 à 16. **\n« Ne soyez-vous pas sous un joug inégal avec les incrédules, car quelle relation y a-t-il entre la justice et l'injustice ? et quelle communion a la lumière avec les ténèbres ?\nEt quel accord Christ a-t-il avec Bélial ? ou quelle part a celui qui croit avec un infidèle?\nEt quel accord le temple de Dieu a-t-il avec les idoles ? car vous êtes le temple du Dieu vivant; comme Dieu l'a dit, j'habiterai en eux et je marcherai en eux; et je serai leur Dieu, et ils seront mon peuple. **\nLes écritures suivantes montrent que vous ne devez pas épouser quelqu'un qui a eu une bonne relation conjugale avec un homme ou avec une femme, mais qui a ensuite rétrogradé et divorcé avec l'homme ou la femme. Par conséquent, avant d'accepter d'épouser quelqu'un, vérifiez l'histoire conjugale de cette personne pour éviter la fornication et l'adultère. dans le mariage. Ceux qui sont mariés devraient encore le confirmer. **\nLuc 16 verset 18 **\n\"Quiconque répudie sa femme et en épouse une autre commet un adultère, et quiconque épouse une femme répudiée par son mari commet un adultère.\" **\nRomains 7 versets 2 et 3 **\n« Car la femme qui a un mari est liée par la loi à son mari tant qu'il vit ; mais si le mari est mort, elle est déliée de la loi de son mari.\nAinsi donc, si, du vivant de son mari, elle est mariée à un autre homme, elle sera appelée adultère, mais si son mari est mort, elle est libre de cette loi ; de sorte qu'elle n'est pas adultère, bien qu'elle soit mariée à un autre homme. **\n \nLorsqu'un homme contracte un mariage correct avec une femme, après avoir suivi les procédures régulières, cette union conjugale reste contraignante. Les personnes dans le mariage, les parents, le tribunal ou l'Église ne peuvent jamais annuler leur mariage. Ne pensez pas que la lettre de divorce du tribunal a le pouvoir d'annuler un vrai mariage que Dieu avait réuni **\nMatthieu 19 verset 6 **\n« C'est pourquoi ils ne sont plus deux, mais une seule chair. Ce que Dieu a donc uni, que l'homme ne le sépare pas. **\nNe prenez pas une femme pour rester avec vous au nom du mariage sans le consentement de ses parents. C'est un péché aux yeux de Dieu qui vous considère comme un voleur. Va t'installer chez ses parents. Payez-lui la dot, ou demandez le consentement parental pour l'épouser et payer la dot plus tard. **\n \nCOURTAGE **\nIl s'agit d'une disposition permettant aux futurs partenaires de mariage d'interagir avec eux-mêmes, de discuter et de planifier à quoi ressembleront leur futur mariage et leur famille. C'est une période de temps pour que les partenaires se connaissent, se jugent et décident de continuer ou non en fonction de ce que les individus ont déduit pendant la période. La période de parade nuptiale est délicate et tentante. L'église doit bien surveiller les futurs partenaires pendant la parade nuptiale pour les empêcher d'actes de souillures et d'immoralité. Gardez-vous pur. La dot doit être payée après la parade nuptiale. N'épousez pas de partenaires immoraux dans l'église. Cela souille l'autel de Dieu. **\n \nTESTS MÉDICAUX **\nDe nombreux mariages sont affectés plus tard et la vie éternelle des partenaires du mariage est compromise parce que certaines conditions de santé ou physiologiques défavorables du corps n'étaient pas connues en raison du manque de tests médicaux avant le mariage. Des tests médicaux et une vérification sont nécessaires pour connaître la disponibilité et l'aptitude des organes génitaux, le statut VIH sida et le génotype pour prévenir les enfants drépanocytaires. **\n \nLE MARIAGE **\nLe mariage à l'église doit suivre un document certifié signé par la ou les personnes appropriées de la famille de la mariée montrant qu'elle a été dûment libérée pour le mariage. La tenue vestimentaire de l'époux et surtout de la mariée et des demoiselles d'honneur doit être sainte. Il vaut mieux semer que louer. Toute forme d'orgueil et de mondanité doit être évitée. Les décorations, les réceptions et toutes les activités doivent rendre gloire à Dieu. Aucune bague de mariage ou toute forme de bijou ne doit être utilisée. La coiffure de la mariée doit être divine. Faites toutes choses pour la gloire de Dieu. Un test de grossesse est obligatoire pour éviter d'épouser une femme enceinte. **\n \nCE QUI REND LE MARIAGE OBLIGATOIRE **\nLorsqu'un homme qui ne s'est jamais marié et une femme qui ne s'est jamais mariée conviennent de se marier, la prochaine chose à faire est de demander le consentement des parents, en particulier de la femme. Les parents de la dame peuvent exiger le paiement d'une dot. Cela doit être réglé ou un accord approprié doit être conclu avec les parents pour la libérer pour le mariage, sans dot ou avec un paiement partiel jusqu'à une date ultérieure, si vous n'avez pas toute leur demande maintenant. A côté de cela, il y a une occasion où la femme doit vous être remise pour le mariage. Dans de nombreuses traditions, la célébration du premier mariage est le jour où la dot est payée. Au cours de cette journée, les parents de la dame et les représentants des parents de l'homme se réunissent pour le prix de la mariée ou la dot à payer. Au cours de cette journée, les parents reçoivent la dot complète ou une partie de celle-ci et concluent un accord pour remettre leur fille à l'homme pour le mariage. Certains appellent ce mariage traditionnel.\nLorsque le mariage à l'église n'est pas prévu par le couple, les parents de la mariée libèrent leur fille pour le mariage ce jour-là et l'homme peut la ramener à la maison en tant qu'épouse pour s'unir avec elle dans une relation sexuelle pour devenir une seule chair. **\nMatthieu 19 verset 5 **\n\"Et dit: A cause de cela, l'homme quittera son père et sa mère, et s'attachera à sa femme, et les deux deviendront une seule chair?\" **\nCependant, lorsqu'il y a un accord entre les parents et les futurs partenaires que leur mariage doit être consommé dans un mariage à l'église, alors le paiement de la dot ou le mariage traditionnel, comme on l'appelle dans certaines cultures, n'est pas la consommation du processus de mariage, mais le mariage à l'église. . Dans ce cas, après le paiement de la dot, la mariée reste sous l'autorité des parents jusqu'au jour du mariage à l'église où elle sera remise à l'église à son mari. Avant cela, ils ne doivent pas avoir de relations sexuelles entre eux. Si cela arrive, c'est un péché parce qu'ils ne sont pas encore mariés. Jusqu'à ce point, le mariage peut être dissous et la dot restituée, car le mariage à l'église, où le processus de mariage devrait être achevé, n'a pas eu lieu. **\n \nUNE CHAIR DANS LE MARIAGE. **\nGenèse 24 verset 6. **\n«Et Isaac l'amena dans la tente de Sara, sa mère, et prit Rebecca, et elle devint sa femme; et il l'aimait… » (Ils sont devenus une seule chair après le sexe) **\n \nAprès le mariage, les relations sexuelles engagées par les nouveaux mariés font d'eux une seule chair. Ils ne peuvent pas être séparés à nouveau pour se marier à un autre jusqu'à ce que l'un d'eux meure. Cependant, dans le cas où l'homme ou la femme n'a pas de parties sexuelles ou des parties sexuelles altérées qui défient le traitement médical, mais a trompé le partenaire, l'union conjugale doit être annulée en raison de la place des relations sexuelles dans le mariage. Cela ne s'applique pas à la mauvaise santé d'un mari ou d'une femme après de nombreuses années de mariage. **\nMatthieu 19 verset 12 **\n\"Car il y a des eunuques qui sont ainsi nés dès le ventre de leur mère, et il y a des eunuques qui sont devenus eunuques des hommes...\" **\nPremier Corinthiens. 7 versets 1 à 5\n«Maintenant, en ce qui concerne les choses dont vous m'avez écrit, il est bon qu'un homme ne touche pas une femme.\nNéanmoins, pour éviter la fornication, que chaque homme ait sa propre femme, et que chaque femme ait son propre mari.\nQue le mari rende à la femme la bienveillance qui lui est due ; et de même aussi la femme au mari.\nLa femme n'a pas le pouvoir de son propre corps, mais le mari ; et de même aussi le mari n'a pas le pouvoir de son propre corps, mais la femme.\nNe vous trompez pas les uns les autres, si ce n'est avec un consentement pour un temps, afin que vous puissiez vous adonner au jeûne et à la prière ; et rassemblez-vous de nouveau, afin que Satan ne vous tente pas pour votre incontinence ». **\nDe telles questions devraient être ouvertes à une autorité ecclésiastique pieuse pour enquête et conclusion. **\nMatthieu 18 verset 18. **\n« En vérité, je vous le dis, tout ce que vous lierez sur la terre sera lié dans les cieux, et tout ce que vous délierez sur la terre sera délié dans les cieux. **\n \nLE BUT DU MARIAGE **\nDieu n'a pas prévu plus d'une femme pour un homme. La polygamie est un péché.\nD'après les Écritures, Dieu a ordonné le mariage pour les personnes suivantes : **\ni.\tFraternité, amitié et amour . (Genèse 2 verset 18). **\nii.\tPlaisir sexuel dans la droiture et la pureté. (Proverbes 5 verset 18 et 19). **\niii.\tEnfant portant. (Genèse 1 verset 28).\niv.\tPureté dans la société humaine et l'église. (1 Corinthiens 7 verset 2). **\nv.\t  Protection mutuelle. (Genèse 20 verset 16). **\nvi.\tPour travailler ensemble dans la commission de Dieu. (Genèse 2 verset 18). **\nvii.\tParce que deux valent mieux qu'un. (Ecclésiaste 4 verset 9 à 12). **\n \nNe vous refusez pas les relations sexuelles, et les relations sexuelles ne doivent pas non plus être pratiquées dans l'impureté contre la loi de la décence. N'imitez pas les approches sexuelles impies de ceux qui sont possédés par de mauvais esprits, comme dans les films bleus, et ne les regardez pas pour souiller votre cœur devant Dieu. **\nLE RÔLE DE LA FEMME DANS LE MARIAGE. **\nÉphésiens 5 versets 22 à 24. **\n« Femmes, soyez soumises à vos maris, comme au Seigneur.\nCar le mari est le chef de la femme, tout comme Christ est le chef de l'Église et il est le sauveur du corps.\nC'est pourquoi, comme l'Église est soumise à Christ, ainsi les femmes le sont en toutes choses à leurs maris. **\n \nL'Écriture demande à la femme de se soumettre à son propre mari comme elle se soumet au Christ. Elle devrait accepter l'autorité et le leadership du mari sur elle et lui obéir avec respect et révérence, comme Sarah a obéi à Abraham. La femme et tout ce qu'elle a obtenu dans le mariage appartiennent à son mari et il ne doit pas en être privé. La femme doit soumettre son corps à son mari. Les femmes doivent apprendre à faire du bien et à plaire à leur mari. Soumettez-vous à votre mari en tout et Dieu vous bénira et vous promouvra, et vous donnera la vie éternelle au nom de Jésus. Il vous fera jouir de la paix. **\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 1,5 et 6. **\n« De même, femmes, soyez soumises à vos propres maris ; que, si quelqu'un n'obéit pas à la parole, il peut aussi, sans la parole, être gagné par la conversation des épouses ;\nCar de cette manière dans l'ancien temps aussi les saintes femmes, qui se confiaient en Dieu, se paraient elles-mêmes, étant soumises à leurs propres maris :\nDe même que Sara obéit à Abraham, l'appelant seigneur, dont vous êtes les filles, pourvu que vous agissiez bien et que vous n'ayez peur d'aucun étonnement. **\nNe soyez pas bientôt en colère, grossier ou têtu envers votre mari. Ne lui mentez pas. Cependant, le mariage avec un homme ne signifie pas que l'âme de la femme est sous le contrôle de l'homme. Non! Son âme est sous le contrôle de Dieu, Aimez Dieu au-dessus de votre mari. Chaque fois que la règle ou la demande de votre mari va à l'encontre de la parole de Dieu, vous devez poliment, humblement mais fermement refuser de lui obéir et être même prête à vous séparer de lui et à rester à l'écart pour servir votre Seigneur et Sauveur Jésus-Christ, si l'homme insiste. sur votre désobéissance à Dieu. La femme doit bien s'occuper des enfants et de la maison. **\nActes 4 versets 19 et 20. **\n«Mais Pierre et Jean répondirent et leur dirent: S'il est juste aux yeux de Dieu de vous écouter plus que Dieu, jugez-vous.\nCar nous ne pouvons que dire les choses que nous avons vues et entendues. **\nActes 5 versets 28 à 29 **\n« Disant : Ne vous avons-nous pas formellement commandé de ne pas enseigner en ce nom ? et voici, vous avez rempli Jérusalem de votre doctrine, et vous avez l'intention de faire venir sur nous le sang de cet homme.\nAlors Pierre et les autres apôtres répondirent et dirent : Nous devons obéir à Dieu plutôt qu'aux hommes. **\n \nLE RÔLE DU MARI **\nEphésiens 5 versets 25 à 28.\n« Maris, aimez vos femmes, comme le Christ a aussi aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle ;\nAfin qu'il la sanctifie et la purifie par le lavage d'eau par la parole,\nAfin qu'il puisse se la présenter comme une église glorieuse, n'ayant ni tache, ni ride, ni quoi que ce soit de semblable ; mais qu'il soit saint et sans défaut.\nAinsi les hommes doivent aimer leurs femmes comme leurs propres corps. Celui qui aime sa femme s'aime lui-même. **\nL'Écriture demande au mari de faire ce qui suit dans le mariage et la famille. **\n\nje. Aimez votre femme autant que Christ a aimé l'église. **\nii. Pourvoir aux besoins de votre femme et de votre famille. iii. Sacrifiez pour votre femme pour la rendre glorieuse à votre satisfaction et votre joie. **\niv.\tNe soyez jamais amer, en colère ou frustrant envers votre femme. Ne parlez pas grossièrement ou avec dépit à votre femme. **\nv.\tChérissez et honorez votre femme. Apprenez à pardonner ses échecs. Apprenez à engager une discussion amicale avec elle. ** vi. Enseignez et éduquez votre femme pour une meilleure compréhension et une vie sainte devant Dieu. **\nvii. Ne vous exaltez jamais au-dessus de votre femme, mais considérez-la comme égale à vous-même devant Dieu à tous égards. **\nUn bon mari ne traitera pas sa femme comme une esclave, ou ne voudra pas la faire honte devant les enfants ou en public. C'est mal de battre sa femme avec la canne ou avec la main. Demandez à Dieu de vous dire ce que vous pouvez faire pour rendre votre femme heureuse afin qu'elle puisse vous aimer et vous bénir davantage. Protégez votre femme de vos relations, voisins et amis. Élevez ensemble vos enfants pour Dieu dans une bonne éducation. Suivez ces règles et Dieu vous bénira. **\n \nSi des enfants ne sont pas nés du mariage, ne voyez pas la faute comme venant de votre femme seule ; cela peut venir de vous aussi, par conséquent; coopérez avec votre femme dans les prières et les efforts médicaux, si nécessaire, pour que le problème soit résolu. Vous devez tous les deux apprendre à être patients devant Dieu comme Sarah et Abraham, Elisabeth et Zacharie, jusqu'à ce que Dieu vous visite avec fécondité. Ne cédez pas à la honte sociale. Ne refusez pas le sexe de votre femme. Cherchez une solution pour le dysfonctionnement sexuel dans votre mariage. Abandonnez-vous aux prières. Cherchez de bons conseillers conjugaux pour aider votre mariage et votre famille. Faites attention au bien-être de vos enfants. Ne les abandonnez pas à leur mère. **\n \nPLANIFICATION FAMILIALE\nProverbes 25 verset 16.\n« As-tu trouvé du miel ? mange autant qu'il te suffit, de peur d'en être rassasié et de le vomir. **\n \nLa planification familiale est essentielle pour le contrôle des naissances. Il n'est pas sage en ce moment d'avoir trop d'enfants. L'alimentation, les médicaments, l'éducation et la formation d'un trop grand nombre d'enfants peuvent rendre la vie amère et frustrante. Utilisez une bonne méthode de planification familiale adaptée à votre corps et contrôlez le nombre d'enfants dans la famille. Ce n'est pas un péché de le faire comme beaucoup de gens le pensent. N'utilisez aucune méthode qui tuera un enfant déjà formé dans le ver. C'est un meurtre ! **\nProverbes 4 verset 7 et 11. **\n« La sagesse est la chose principale ; acquiers donc la sagesse, et avec tout ce que tu as acquis, acquiers l'intelligence.\nJe t'ai enseigné dans la voie de la sagesse; Je t'ai conduit dans les bons chemins ». **\n \nPAS DE DIVORCE ET DE REMARIAGE **\n1 Corinthiens 7 versets 10 à 16. **\n« Et aux mariés, je n'ordonne pas à moi, mais au Seigneur, que la femme ne se sépare pas de son mari ;\nMais et si elle s'en va, qu'elle reste célibataire ou se réconcilie avec son mari ; et que le mari ne répudie pas sa femme.\nMais c'est moi, et non le Seigneur, qui parle aux autres. Si un frère a une femme qui ne croit pas, et qu'il lui plaise d'habiter avec lui, qu'il ne la répudie pas.\nEt la femme qui a un mari qui ne croit pas, et s'il lui plaît d'habiter avec elle, qu'elle ne le quitte pas.\nCar le mari incroyant est sanctifié par la femme, et la femme incroyante est sanctifiée par le mari, sinon vos enfants seraient impurs ; mais maintenant ils sont saints.\nMais si l'incrédule s'en va, qu'il s'en aille. Un frère ou une sœur n'est pas asservi dans de tels cas, mais Dieu nous a appelés à la paix.\nCar que sais-tu, femme, si tu sauveras ton mari ? ou comment sais-tu, ô homme, si tu sauveras ta femme ? **\n \nUn couple marié certifié par les Écritures est une seule chair et ne peut pas se séparer pour se marier avec une autre personne, jusqu'à la mort de l'un d'eux. Cependant, la Bible permet la séparation à cause de la méchanceté insupportable qui peut provenir de l'un des partenaires du mariage, dont témoignent l'église et la société. Dans ce cas, la personne séparée doit rester célibataire ou se réconcilier à nouveau avec l'autre partenaire. Sachez que l'adultère ne sépare pas le mariage, seule la fornication le fait. (Jean 8 versets 3 à 11). (Matthieu 5 verset 32). L'adultère est l'immoralité sexuelle commise par une personne mariée, tandis que la fornication est l'immoralité sexuelle commise par une personne non mariée. Tous ceux qui divorcent de leur partenaire à cause de l'adultère et en épousent un autre commettent un adultère aux yeux de Dieu (Romains 7 versets 2 et 3). **\nSi l'un des partenaires refuse de revenir mais se marie avec une autre personne qui ne s'est jamais mariée, ils sont dans la fornication et l'adultère et finiront dans le feu de l'enfer. Lorsque la Bible dit : « Si l'incroyant s'en va, qu'il s'en aille », cela n'oblige pas l'autre partenaire à se remarier. Ce sera toujours l'adultère. Le partenaire croyant doit rester célibataire et doit savoir qu'il n'est pas empêché de s'engager dans le service de Dieu à cause du départ du partenaire du mariage. Il ou elle devrait être disponible devant Dieu pour son service selon sa volonté. Utilisez votre vie de célibataire pour servir le Seigneur de tout votre cœur. **\n1 Corinthiens 7 versets 27 et 32. **\n« Es-tu lié à une femme ? chercher à ne pas être délié. Es-tu détaché d'une femme? ne cherche pas de femme.\nMais je t'aurais sans précaution. Celui qui n'est pas marié se soucie des choses qui appartiennent au Seigneur, comment il peut plaire au Seigneur. **\n \nMARIAGE ET MINISTERE **\n1 Timothée 3 versets 4, 5 et 11. **\n« Celui qui gouverne bien sa propre maison, ayant ses enfants soumis avec toute gravité ;\n(Car si un homme ne sait pas gouverner sa propre maison, comment prendra-t-il soin de l'église de Dieu ?)\nDe même leurs femmes doivent être graves, non médisantes, sobres, fidèles en toutes choses. **\nIl est exigé dans le ministère que le ministre garde une famille bonne et bien contrôlée, ayant la femme et les enfants vivant dans la justice devant Dieu afin que le nom du Seigneur ne soit pas blasphémé. Une tenue et un caractère pieux appropriés sont attendus d'eux (Genèse 18 verset 18 et 19). **\n \nRESTITUTION DANS LE MARIAGE **\nGenèse 20 verset 2 à 7. **\n« Et Abraham dit de Sara sa femme : C'est ma sœur et Abimélek, roi de Guérar, envoya prendre Sara.\nMais Dieu vint à Abimélek en songe pendant la nuit, et lui dit : Voici, tu n'es qu'un homme mort, à cause de la femme que tu as prise ; car elle est la femme d'un homme.\nMais Abimélec ne s'était pas approché d'elle, et il dit : Seigneur, tueras-tu aussi une nation juste ?\nNe m'a-t-il pas dit : C'est ma sœur ? et elle, elle-même a dit: C'est mon frère; dans l'intégrité de mon cœur et l'innocence de mes mains j'ai fait cela.\nEt Dieu lui dit dans un songe : Oui, je sais que tu as fait cela dans l'intégrité de ton cœur ; car je t'ai aussi retenu de pécher contre moi : c'est pourquoi je ne t'ai pas permis de la toucher.\nMaintenant donc, rends à l'homme sa femme; car c'est un prophète, et il priera pour toi, et tu vivras, et si tu ne la rétablis pas, sache que tu mourras certainement, toi et tous ceux qui sont à toi. **\nSi un homme quitte la première femme légale qu'il a épousée correctement selon les écritures, et épouse une autre femme, il a offensé Dieu. La même chose s'applique à une femme.\nLe jugement de Dieu pour cela est le feu de l'enfer. **\nMarc 10 verset 11 et 12. **\n« Et dans la maison, ses disciples l'interrogèrent encore sur la même chose.\nEt il leur dit : Quiconque répudie sa femme et en épouse une autre, commet un adultère à son encontre ». **\nCe que Dieu demande, c'est la restitution. Cela signifie que le mariage doit être dissous, quelle que soit sa durée et quel que soit le nombre d'enfants impliqués. Beaucoup de gens ne connaissent pas cette vérité. Certains s'y opposent. Mais sans restitution dans cette relation pécheresse dans le mariage, le chrétien ne peut pas aller au ciel. Cherchez un avocat pour votre cas, si vous n'êtes pas clair. Laissez l'homme ou la femme retourner chez l'ancien partenaire ou rester célibataire. Ceci est pratiqué par les vrais chrétiens jusqu'à aujourd'hui. **\n\n",

Béni soit le Dieu et Père de notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ, qui, selon son abondante miséricorde, nous a régénérés pour une vive espérance par la résurrection de Jésus-Christ d'entre les morts, pour un héritage incorruptible et sans souillure, et qui ne flétrit pas, réservé au paradis pour toi.  **\n \nÀ propos de l'auteur  **\nPasteur Paul Rika, directeur international et fondateur de Holiness Revival Ministry Worldwide, alias Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide dont le siège est à Abuja, au Nigeria. A été un prédicateur de la sainteté et de la justice pendant une dizaine d'années maintenant. Il réside actuellement à Abuja, au Nigeria. D'où Il dirige les affaires du Mouvement Mondial. Mouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde. Horemow est un ministère non confessionnel, consacré à la propagation de la justice et de la sainteté du Christ dans les églises et les nations du monde, par le biais de croisades, de réunions de réveil, de conférences, de production et de diffusion de littératures et de documents sur la sainteté.  **\n\nChapitre un  **\nL'habillage du divin  **\n \nLa Bible dit Premier Timothée 2 verset 9 à 10  **\n « De la même manière aussi, que les femmes se parent d'habits modestes, avec pudeur et sobriété ; pas avec des cheveux tressés, ou de l'or, ou des perles, ou une parure coûteuse;\nMais (ce qui convient aux femmes professant la piété) avec de bonnes œuvres.  **\nL'habillement du divin est très important. En tant que femme chrétienne, la façon dont vous vous habillez est importante car la Bible dit que sans la sainteté, personne ne peut voir Dieu » Hébreux 12 verset 14 . Beaucoup croient que Dieu ne regarde qu'à l'intérieur du cœur. Le seigneur nous a couvert son visage à cause de notre vie pécheresse. La façon dont nous vivons nos vies, le Seigneur n'est pas content de nous. La Bible dit, pour cette même insistance sur la sainteté, la sainteté de vie, que les femmes d'autrefois se paraient de vêtements modestes. Ne vous habillez pas grossièrement et ne vous habillez pas de manière minable pour faire honte au nom du Seigneur. Ne sois pas sale.  **\nDe la même manière aussi que les femmes se parent , belles, propres, fines, mais en vêtements modestes, en vêtements pieux avec honte; couvrant toutes les parties qu'aucune partie ne soit exposée pour vous faire honte. Couvrez toutes les pièces, toutes vos pièces. N'exposez pas votre corps. Habillez-vous avec pudeur et sobriété.  **\nAyez la maîtrise de soi et la sobriété, pas avec des cheveux tressés, une coiffure fantaisiste comme des prostituées ou comme des pécheurs dans les rues. Voulant vendre leur corps. C'est la souillure de leur corps. Pas avec des cheveux tressés ou de l'or. Selon la Bible, ils appartiennent à Satan. Cet or, ces perles, etc. coûtent très cher et les femmes de l'époque se les pendaient pour les ajouter à leur dignitaire. Ce sont les choses que le Seigneur indique. Ce ne sont pas seulement des choses normales de la vie, mais ce sont des choses qui n'ont pas de sens. Ils sont pour la fierté des femmes. Ils sont pour la beauté supplémentaire d'une femme pour la faire attirer les hommes et polluer la société. Et cela est contraire à la droiture et à la piété. Alors ces perles; ce n'est pas avec des perles ou un assortiment coûteux que les femmes élevées dans la société désirent s'habiller au-dessus des autres. Vous voulez mettre des robes coûteuses pour avoir l'air supérieur dans la société parce que vous voulez vous promouvoir, avoir l'air haut et porter des vêtements coûteux qui mettront vos épaules très haut au-dessus des femmes dans la société.  **\nVous poussez les femmes de la Société à vous idolâtrer et c'est maintenant vous qui posez des problèmes aux femmes. Elles ne peuvent pas rester à la maison en dérangeant leurs maris pour qu'ils en achètent pour elles. Certaines diront à leurs maris, \"si tu m'aimes\", \"regarde cette femme, le tissu qu'elle met, l'enveloppe est d'environ 70 000,00 Naira environ 438 dollars , c'est vous qui dérangez l'église.  **\nVous poussez les femmes à détourner leur esprit de Dieu et elles se sont tournées vers vous. Ils vous regarderont maintenant et voudront vous imiter afin de se sentir également importants.\nMais ce n'est pas une émulation pieuse et ce n'est pas l'exemple que le Seigneur veut que vous donniez. Ce n'est pas ce que Dieu veut que les gens imitent. Soyez un exemple pour les croyants en paroles, en conversation, en foi, en charité, dans l'église du Christ et tournez-les vers Dieu.  **\nC'est là que vous devriez être un exemple. Mais à quoi devrait ressembler votre tenue vestimentaire qui convient aux femmes qui professent la piété ? Quel est le type d'habillement et le type de parure qui conviennent aux femmes qui décrivent une femme pieuse ? Chaque fois que vous êtes vu, les gens verront-ils le christianisme dans votre vie ? Si votre habillement est pieux, quand on vous verra, nous verrons la droiture et la sainteté dans votre vie. Nous verrons la douceur de Christ dans votre vie, la décence de Christ dans votre vie.\nLes gens verront la gloire de Dieu dans votre vie. Nous verrons la parole précieuse sortir d'une femme qui a été purifiée et sanctifiée pour le Seigneur. Cela devrait être votre apparence en tant que femme chrétienne. Dans le livre de Premier Pierre 4 verset 1 à 5. La Bible dit  **\n« Puisque donc Christ a souffert pour nous dans la chair, armez-vous également de la même pensée ; car celui qui a souffert dans la chair a cessé de pécher ;\nQu'il ne devrait plus vivre le reste de son temps dans la chair aux convoitises des hommes, mais à la volonté de Dieu.\nCar le temps passé de notre vie peut nous suffire pour avoir forgé la volonté des Gentils, alors que nous marchions dans la lascivité, les convoitises, l'excès de vin, les festivités, les banquets et les idolâtries abominables ;\nEn quoi ils trouvent étrange que vous ne couriez pas avec eux au même excès d'émeute, disant du mal de vous  \nQui lui rendra compte\nqui est prêt à juger les vivants et les morts.  **\nA qui parle le Seigneur ? Il s'agit d'une femme qui a un mari incroyant. Cette partie de l'Écriture s'adresse aux femmes qui ont des maris incroyants. Mais ce sont des femmes chrétiennes. Ce sont des femmes pieuses. Alors, quelle est l'exhortation et l'encouragement du Seigneur à ces femmes qui ont des maris incroyants ? Quelle est la mise en garde du Seigneur aux femmes qui ont des maris incroyants ? Avez-vous un incroyant pour mari?  **\nLa Bible dit   « Femmes, soyez soumises à votre propre mari, même le mari incrédule qui n'obéit pas à la parole de Dieu ».  **\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 1 Soumettez-vous; obéissez à ce mari incrédule que vous aussi sans la parole de Dieu serez gagné par votre conversation.\nSans entendre la parole, sans avoir à venir à l'église, sans avoir à lire la Bible, en voyant ta vie, ton caractère, ta douceur, la soumission de ta vie, la soumission de ton corps, tu n'es pas dur pour lui de contrôle; juste par votre obéissance, en suivant la parole de Dieu; ça va lui piquer le coeur. Il comprendra l'évangile par votre style de vie. Ne pensez pas que vous gagnerez ce mari incrédule en vous habillant. S'il vous plaît, ne pensez pas que vous allez devenir fantaisiste juste pour gagner votre mari.  **\nConsidérez ce que la Bible dit dans Hébreux 1 verset 1 à 3    **\n« Dieu, qui à plusieurs reprises et de diverses manières a autrefois parlé à nos pères par les prophètes,\nEn ces derniers jours, nous a-t-il parlé par son Fils, qu'il a établi héritier de toutes choses, par qui aussi il a créé les mondes;\nLequel étant l'éclat de sa gloire, et l'image expresse de sa personne, et soutenant toutes choses par la parole de sa puissance, quand il eut par lui-même purgé nos péchés, s'assit à la droite de la Majesté d'en haut   »   **\nDieu a présenté Jésus afin que nous puissions le suivre et l'écouter dans tous les aspects de notre vie. Naître de nouveau signifie mort à Christ. Femmes, vous êtes mortes à Christ. Vous ne commettez plus de péché; vous ne vous comportez pas comme vous le souhaitez. Une femme morte en Christ dépend de Dieu. Aucune ambition, aucune conversation pécheresse et morte à son ancien moi, aucun désir de la chair, se soumet librement à son propre mari. Paul l'a compris et il a dit   « Christ vit en moi ». ( Galates 2 verset 20 ) Quoi que je fasse, c'est Christ qui le fait pour moi. Dieu cherche un bon caractère chez les femmes. La voie pour devenir grand en Christ est la soumission.  **\nRomains 12 versets 14 à 21  **\n« Bénissez ceux qui vous persécutent   bénissez et ne maudissez pas.\nRéjouissez-vous avec ceux qui se réjouissent, et pleurez avec ceux qui pleurent.\nSoyez du même avis les uns envers les autres. Ne vous souciez pas des choses élevées, mais condescendez aux hommes de basse condition. Ne soyez pas sage dans vos propres vanités.\nNe récompensez personne mal pour mal. Fournir des choses honnêtes aux yeux de tous les hommes.\nS'il est possible, autant qu'il dépend de vous, vivez en paix avec tous les hommes.\nChers bien-aimés, ne vous vengez pas, mais cédez plutôt à la colère   car il est écrit   La vengeance est à moi ; Je rendrai, dit le Seigneur.\nSi donc ton ennemi a faim, nourris-le; s'il a soif, donne-lui à boire, car en agissant ainsi tu amasseras des charbons ardents sur sa tête.\nNe soyez pas vaincu par le mal, mais surmontez le mal par le bien. \"  **\nFemme, aime ce méchant homme comme ton mari. S'il vous plaît, ne pensez pas que vous gagnerez votre mari - cet homme incrédule par votre habillement extérieur. Laissez-moi me faire fantasque, je me ferai grand, je me ferai flamboyant. Je vais me faire belle pour que mon mari m'aime, pour qu'il fasse attention à moi. Paul a dit non ! Ne vous donnez pas l'habillage extérieur de tresser les cheveux. Ne pensez-vous pas impressionner votre mari par votre coiffure ou par la décoration des cheveux ? Au fait, vous tressez vos cheveux ? Au fait, tu as mis quelque chose dessus ? Non! Ne vous coiffez pas comme le monde le fait. Ne dites pas que je le fais à cause de mon mari ; plaire à mon mari. je\nveux gagner mon mari. La Bible dit, 'ne fais pas ça'. Vous ne pouvez gagner cet homme que si vous êtes une vraie femme chrétienne. Avez-vous un miroir dans votre maison qu'après vous être habillé, vous regarderez encore et encore avant de sortir ? Vous ne gagnerez que cet homme avec un caractère pieux, même l'ornement d'un esprit doux et calme seulement. Dieu utilisera votre caractère pieux sur votre mari au nom de Jésus. prenez note que ce n'est pas votre coiffure, pas la coiffure fantaisiste, pas la coiffure impie. Vous pouvez dire que votre mari est impie et vous allez maintenant utiliser la coiffure impie des gens du monde pour le gagner. Non!\nNe pensez pas que parce que les cheveux des autres femmes sont fantaisistes, vous ferez aussi les vôtres comme ça. Non! Ce n'est pas par la coiffure extérieure que vous pouvez gagner cet homme ou le port de l'or. Maintenant, en parlant d'or, c'est ce que font les prostituées pour attirer l'attention des clients et pourquoi essayer d'attirer votre mari avec ? Ne dites pas que je vais lui faire m'aimer en mettant de l'or et en ayant l'air fantaisiste, en mettant des décorations et des maquillages. Non! c'est la mauvaise façon, non, ne le faites pas ainsi. C'est l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille qui, du côté de Dieu, est d'un grand prix. C'est ce que le Saint-Esprit vous utilisera pour faire sur votre mari.  **\n \nChapitre deux   La norme de Dieu ne peut pas changer pour la mondanité.  **\n  \nIl y a des églises qui disent, si tu veux gagner ton mari, habille-toi comme les gens du monde, c'est alors, Que le cœur de ton mari se tournera vers toi. En raison des enseignements erronés de nos jours, les femmes portent des pantalons ; même les femmes mariées s'habillent comme des prostituées. La robe de dinde, les robes très courtes et exposant le corps règnent désormais partout. Parce que de telles églises enseignent que c'est ainsi que les filles dans le monde s'habillent pour gagner le cœur des hommes, alors elles s'habillent comme ça pour gagner leurs maris, s'habillant de la même manière impie afin que vous puissiez avoir votre mari.\nLe Seigneur dit   Non ! Ne faites pas les choses comme le monde fait les leurs, parce que si vous pensez que vous pouvez gagner votre mari ou l'attirer d'une manière aussi impie, alors vous perdez votre temps. N'entrez pas dans ces bijoux que le monde porte, pensant que vous pouvez avoir votre mari, dit la Parole de Dieu; de la même manière que les saintes femmes d'autrefois , aussi Premier Pierre 3 verset 3 , Votre beauté ne doit pas provenir d'une parure extérieure, telle que des cheveux tressés et le port d'or, de bijoux et de beaux vêtements ou d'une parure coûteuse. (Parure signifie - rendre plus attrayant, décoration)\nEn revêtant des vêtements, nous devons obtenir le langage biblique. Il y a quelque chose que nous devons comprendre. Pendant que vous faites comprendre aux gens la parole de Dieu, regardez les Écritures et voyez comment les amener à comprendre la Bible.\nNous devons voir et expliquer le mot de manière à ce que les gens comprennent ce que l'Écriture nous dit réellement en tant que chrétiens.  **\nDans Néhémie 8 verset 8 .  **\n\"Alors ils ont lu distinctement dans le livre de la loi de Dieu, et en ont donné le sens, et leur ont fait comprendre la lecture .\"  **\n Pouvez-vous voir la place d'un prédicateur et d'un enseignant ? Si nous vous laissons à l'Écriture sur l'habillement, beaucoup tomberont dessus. Vous allez mal interpréter et entrer dans l'erreur. Ainsi, ils ont lu la loi de Dieu et l'ont bien expliquée à la compréhension du peuple. Ils leur ont fait comprendre la lecture par l'interprétation des lectures.  **\nRetour à Premier Pierre 3 verset 3 et 4  **\n« Dont la parure ne soit pas cette parure extérieure de tresser les cheveux, et de porter de l'or, ou de se vêtir ;\nMais que ce soit l'homme caché du cœur, dans ce qui n'est pas corruptible, même l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille, qui est dans le\nvue de Dieu de grand prix.  **\nCertains envisageront de s'habiller et diront, alors vous voulez dire que nous ne devrions pas nous habiller ? Tu veux dire qu'on ne devrait pas se tresser les cheveux ? Est-ce que mettre des vêtements est mauvais ? Expliquez bien pour qu'ils comprennent. Bien-aimés, les écritures ont rejeté le port de l'or.\nL'histoire nous a montré la source de ces choses et leur souillure. Mais alors, pas le tressage des cheveux, cela fait référence à la coiffure impie d'une femme pécheresse dans la rue qui semble impressionner les hommes.\nLa Bible dit que les femmes mariées, les femmes chrétiennes ne copient pas leur style, pensant que vous allez impressionner votre mari. Parlons de la décoration, de la flamboyance, de la hauteur d'esprit, de l'habillement stylé, dont les femmes du monde se servent pour attirer les clients vers elles. N'allez pas dans cette direction en mettant vos vêtements parce que vous voulez gagner votre mari. Ne devenez pas impie, ne mettez pas de vêtements qui ne glorifieront pas Dieu dans votre vie. Tout parle de souillure. Éloignez-vous de toute forme de souillure.\nCar Dieu est Saint, « Comme des enfants obéissants, ne vous façonnant pas selon les anciennes convoitises dans votre ignorance   » [1 Pierre 1 verset 14] Mais, comme celui qui vous a appelés est saint, soyez saints, dans toutes vos manières. ornement. Dans votre coiffure, assurez-vous que la sainteté est là, rien ne doit être emprunté au monde. Rien copié du monde dans votre vie, parce que, vous voulez impressionner quelqu'un ou dans la mise de vêtements.  **\nAssurez-vous de ne pas copier les robes mondaines du monde ; l'habillage médiocre, les robes nues parce que, tu veux toucher ton mari, tu veux gagner ton mari. Ne dites pas  \"Si votre mari convoite les femmes dans le monde, vous lui exposerez le corps qu'il voit dehors dans la maison afin que sa convoitise puisse être sur vous\" N'allez pas à cette mode de ce monde lubrique . Qui t'a dit que tous les hommes pouvaient te convoiter ?\nIl ne t'a pas épousé dans la maison pour te convoiter alors, ne fais pas ces choses. Ne copiez pas ces choses du monde mais regardez-les au verset 4 du premier Pierre ? Que ce soit le cœur pieux, l'homme caché du cœur, le caractère caché, la personne cachée du cœur.\nRevêtez-vous de l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille qui, du côté de Dieu, est d'un grand prix. Premier Pierre 3 verset 5 « Que les maris soient croyants ou non, les vieilles femmes se parent de manières divines . ”\nAssurez-vous d'éviter toute forme de mondanité dans la coiffure, toute forme de mondanité de bijoux dans la décoration corporelle. C'est ainsi que faisaient les saintes femmes d'autrefois en se coiffant. Ils se sont coiffés normalement. Chaque fois que vous tressez vos cheveux, sur la base du principe de professer des femmes pieuses, faites-le de manière à ce que lorsqu'elles vous voient, elles voient le christianisme.  **\nAssurez-vous qu'il n'y a rien de sale, rien de souillé, rien d'impie dans votre apparence car vous voulez gagner les gens à Dieu par vos vêtements ; rien que, agréable, propre, décent; parce que notre Dieu est un Dieu saint. C'est ce que la parole de Dieu nous dit de faire en tant que femmes chrétiennes. Mais pourquoi le Seigneur nous met-il en garde contre cet habillement impie, car cela vient de Satan. Toutes ces choses viennent de Satan. Regardez-le dans Ephésiens 2 verset 1 à 3  **\n« Et il vous a vivifié, vous qui étiez morts par vos offenses et vos péchés ;\nOù autrefois vous marchiez selon le cours de ce monde, selon le prince de la puissance de l'air, l'esprit qui agit maintenant chez les enfants de la désobéissance  \nParmi lesquels aussi nous avons tous eu notre conversation dans les temps passés dans les convoitises de notre chair, accomplissant les désirs de la chair et de l'esprit ; et étaient par nature les enfants de la colère, comme les autres » .  **\n  Maintenant, dans le passé, nous travaillons selon le cours de ce monde . Ces choses (mondanité) sont selon ce monde; selon le prince et la puissance de l'air. Ces choses viennent de Satan, toutes les coiffures, les coiffures impies (exemple WEAVON) et les robes impies sont les créations de Satan. L'esprit qui agit maintenant chez les enfants de la désobéissance. Satan l'a conçu pour eux. Ces robes impies, ce corps exposant des robes, Satan les conçoit pour ses enfants, ce sont des enfants de désobéissance. La Bible dit que lorsque nous étions dans la désobéissance, nous vivions selon eux, nous nous coiffions comme les leurs, nous ne sommes pas nés de nouveau, nous nous coiffions à la mode, nous portions ce genre de choses, nous portions de l'or. Mais maintenant, vous êtes un chrétien, ne faites plus ces choses, ne vous façonnez plus parce que ce sont les choses que font les gens et la colère de Dieu vient sur eux.  **\n Apocalypse 17 verset 1 à 6  **\n« Et l'un des sept anges qui avaient les sept coupes vint et me parla, me disant   Viens ici ; Je te montrerai le jugement de la grande prostituée qui est assise sur de nombreuses eaux  \nAvec qui les rois de la terre ont commis fornication, et les habitants de la terre se sont enivrés du vin de sa fornication.\nAlors il m'emporta en esprit dans le désert, et je vis une femme assise sur une bête écarlate, pleine de noms de blasphème, ayant sept têtes et dix cornes.\nEt la femme était vêtue de pourpre et d'écarlate, et parée d'or et de pierres précieuses et de perles, ayant une coupe d'or dans sa main pleine d'abominations et de souillures de sa fornication;\nEt sur son front était écrit un nom   MYSTÈRE, BABYLONE LA GRANDE, LA MÈRE DES PROSTITUÉES ET DES ABOMINATIONS DE LA TERRE. 6 Et j'ai vu la femme ivre du sang des saints et du sang des martyrs de Jésus, et quand je l'ai vue, j'ai été saisi d'une grande admiration. pouvez-vous voir ces choses dont la Bible nous parle, et c'est ce qu'elle s'habille et habille aussi ses filles. Elle est la mère de la prostituée pour amener les rois de ce monde à commettre la fornication, pour faire enivrer l'habitation de ce monde avec sa coupe de fornication.  **\n Ces choses sont fournies par le diable pour promouvoir l'immoralité, pour promouvoir la fornication. Regardez-le du verset 3 à 6 \"\nAlors il m'emporta en esprit dans le désert , et je vis une femme assise sur une bête écarlate, pleine de noms de blasphème, ayant sept têtes et dix cornes.\nEt la femme était vêtue de pourpre et d'écarlate, et parée d'or, de pierres précieuses et de perles, ayant une coupe d'or dans sa main pleine d'abominations et de souillures de sa fornication  \nEt sur son front était écrit un nom   MYSTÈRE, BABYLONE LA GRANDE, LA MÈRE DES PROSTITUÉES ET DES ABOMINATIONS DE LA TERRE.\nEt je vis la femme ivre du sang des saints et du sang des martyrs de Jésus   et quand je la vis, je m'étonnai avec\ngrande admiration. »   **\npouvez-vous voir ces choses dont la Bible nous parle, et c'est ce qu'elle s'habille et habille aussi ses filles. Elle est la mère d'une prostituée pour provoquer les rois de ce monde à commettre l'impudicité, à enivrer l'habitation de ce monde de sa coupe d'impudicité.\nPouvez-vous la voir, pouvez-vous voir pourquoi ces choses devraient être évitées dans votre vie ? Ils viennent de la mère des prostituées, les boucles d'oreilles, les bijoux, les perles, la coiffure fantaisiste, l'habillage coloré. En parlant du port de vêtements, vous voyez que le type de vêtements ici n'est pas un vêtement ordinaire, c'est celui qui favorise l'immoralité. C'est de cela dont nous parlons.  **\nC'est le type d'habillement qui favorise l'immoralité qui attire les hommes. C'est de cela que parle le Seigneur. Mère de prostituées, elle a introduit ces choses dans ce monde. L'or, les perles et ces choses que vous voyez porter les femmes. Les boucles d'oreilles, le collier, les perles ; tout ce port de pantalons et de guenilles, les robes exposantes, viennent de la mère des prostituées et de la mère des ABOMINATIONS de la terre , elle avait bu le sang des saints, des saints rétrogrades ont commis l'immoralité avec elle. Elle a fait tomber des gens dans l'église, des gens qui sont « nés de nouveau », des gens qui ont échappé au péché. À cause de ses œuvres et des œuvres de ses filles dans l'église, elle a amené les croyants à commettre l'immoralité avec elle, s'enivrant ainsi de leur sang. Elle a aussi tué leur foi.\nDans l'une des églises, Jésus est apparu et a dit que certains hommes avaient perdu leur salut. Il les montrait une par une, et si l'enlèvement vient maintenant, elles n'iront pas au Ciel à cause des filles de prostituées qui sont dans l'église, à cause des mini-jupes, des jupes moulantes, ça ne va pas couvre très bien le corps. Dieu n'aime pas ça. Ce tissu exposant, le tissu exposant la poitrine, le tissu exposant le dos et la blouse qui ne dépasse pas le genou. Ils sont l'uniforme de la prostitution que la mère des prostituées, les démons vous a donné et les saints meurent à cause d'eux.\nQuand vous voudrez parler d'eux, le monde ne sera pas content de vous, car ils veulent avoir accès à l'église mais nous ne nous tairons plus. Je dis que nous ne nous tairons pas ! pas dans cette zone.  **\nNombres 25 versets 6 à 16  **\n« Et voici, l'un des enfants de\nIsraël vint et amena à ses frères une Madianite à la vue de Moïse et à la vue de toute l'assemblée des enfants d'Israël, qui pleuraient devant l'entrée du tabernacle d'assignation.\nEt lorsque Phinées, fils d'Eléazar, fils d'Aaron, le sacrificateur, vit cela, il se leva du milieu de l'assemblée, et prit un javelot dans sa main ;\nEt il alla après l'homme d'Israël dans la tente, et les fit passer tous les deux, l'homme d'Israël et la femme par le ventre. Ainsi la peste fut arrêtée des enfants d'Israël.\nEt ceux qui moururent de la peste étaient vingt-quatre mille.\nEt l'Éternel parla à Moïse, disant  \nPhinées, fils d'Eléazar, fils d'Aaron, le sacrificateur, a détourné ma colère des enfants d'Israël, tandis qu'il était zélé au milieu d'eux à cause de moi, de sorte que je n'ai pas consumé les enfants d'Israël dans ma jalousie.\nC'est pourquoi dis  Voici, je lui donne mon alliance de paix \nEt il l'aura, et sa semence après lui, l'alliance d'un sacerdoce éternel; parce qu'il avait du zèle pour son Dieu, et qu'il avait fait l'expiation pour les enfants d'Israël.\nOr le nom de l'Israélite qui fut tué, même qui fut tué avec la Madianite, était Zimri, fils de Salu, prince d'une maison principale parmi les Siméonites.\nEt le nom de la femme madianite qui fut tuée était Cozbi, la fille de Zur ; il était le chef d'un peuple et d'une maison principale à Madian.\nEt l'Éternel parla à\nMoïse, disant  … »    **\nBeaucoup de sœurs aujourd'hui sont juste là pour tuer les croyants, tuer l'église de Christ, si vous ne vous repentez pas, si vous êtes toujours comme ça, votre jugement est très proche. Jésus pleure chaque jour parce que des prostituées ont tué et tuent ses saints. Si vous dites que vous vous en fichez, vous vous en soucierez plus tard en enfer. Les jeunes d'aujourd'hui ne veulent pas qu'on les contrôle ; c'est l'œuvre du diable sur vous.  **\nMaintenant Premier Pierre 3 verset 3  **\n\" Dont la parure ne soit pas cette parure extérieure de tresser les cheveux, et de porter de l'or, ou de se vêtir ; \"    **\nNous devrions comprendre quelque chose. Y a-t-il une écriture quelque part qui nous parle de tresser les cheveux qui nous donnera une signification supplémentaire à cette écriture ? Y a-t-il une écriture qui apparaît ailleurs sur les vêtements qui peut nous aider à comprendre l'esprit de Dieu de ce qui est dit ici ? (Oui). Nous disons que la belle-fille de Juda a mis des vêtements, des vêtements de prostituée, de prostituée, alors, ce port de vêtements met en garde contre l'habillement de la prostituée.\nIl met en garde contre les mauvaises tenues qui peuvent inciter les gens à l'immoralité. Si vous vérifiez une autre partie de la Bible, comment le roi se revêtira-t-il, Hérode se revêtit d'un vêtement royal, d'un grand vêtement. Il parle des robes qui favorisent la fierté. Évitez cela. Mais alors, qu'en est-il du port de l'or ? Y a-t-il d'autres Écritures qui parlent de l'or afin que nous puissions comprendre ce qu'est la pensée de Dieu ? De l'ancien et du nouveau testament la question de l'or a-t-elle été avertie ? Oui.  **\nGenèse 35 verset 1 à 4  **\n\" Et Dieu dit à Jacob  Lève-toi, monte à Béthel, et habite là; et fais-y un autel au Dieu, qui t'apparut lorsque tu fus enfui devant la face d'Esaü, ton frère. Alors Jacob dit à sa maison, et à tous ceux qui étaient avec lui, ôtez les dieux étrangers qui sont au milieu de vous, et soyez purs, et changez vos vêtements.\nEt levons-nous, et montons à Béthel; et j'y ferai un autel à Dieu, qui m'a exaucé au jour de ma détresse, et qui a été avec moi dans le chemin où j'ai marché.\nEt ils donnèrent à Jacob tous les dieux étrangers qui étaient entre leurs mains, et toutes leurs boucles d'oreilles qui étaient à leurs oreilles ; et Jacob les cacha\nsous le chêne qui était près de Sichem.    **\nIl s'agit de vêtements, ce qui signifie que ce vêtement dont parle le Seigneur est le type de vêtement que vous ne pouvez pas porter lorsque vous traitez avec le Seigneur. Jacob dit de changer de vêtement.\nLe Seigneur m'a demandé de venir lui consacrer mais, ces vêtements que vous portez, nous ne pouvons pas servir le Seigneur avec. Changez-les, c'est ce que nous disons. Ne les portez plus, vous ne pouvez pas servir le Seigneur avec des vêtements pollués. Au lieu que les gens voient Dieu en vous; ils verront des vêtements pollués. Ne fais pas ça.\nSoit simple. De telles robes ne représentent pas la modération, brûlez-les toutes. Qu'elles soient courtes, grandes, noires, blanches, rouges, plates, elles doivent toutes être détruites.\nAucun type n'est recommandé pour une femme chrétienne, pour ceux qui veulent servir Dieu, aucun type de tenue impie n'est recommandé. Retirez-le complètement.  **\nExode 33 versets 4 à 6  **\n« Et quand le peuple entendit ces mauvaises nouvelles, il se lamenta, et personne ne lui remit ses ornements.\nCar l'Éternel avait dit à Moïse   Dis aux enfants d'Israël   Vous êtes un peuple au cou raide ; je monterai au milieu de vous en un instant, et je vous dévorerai ; C'est pourquoi, maintenant, ôte tes ornements, afin que je sache ce que je dois te faire.\nEt les enfants d'Israël se sont dépouillés de leurs ornements près du mont Horeb.   **\nPurification totale, gens au cou raide. Enlevez ces choses que vous mettez pour votre beauté extérieure, ils les ont toutes enlevées et elles ont été totalement lavées. Quand une petite fille sort pendant la grossesse, y a-t-il déjà eu une boucle d'oreille sur l'oreille de quelqu'un ?.  **\n \nChapitre Trois   L'habillement et la pudeur d'un chrétien  **\n \n1 Pierre 1 verset 14 à 17, Colossiens 1 verset 28 à 29, 2 Corinthiens 7 verset 1, Proverbes 7 verset 10  **\n\n L'utilisation du pantalon  \n Deutéronome 22 verset 5  **\n\"La femme ne portera pas ce qui appartient à un homme, et un homme ne mettra pas un vêtement de femme, car tous ceux qui le font sont en abomination à l'Éternel, ton Dieu.\"   **\nÇa trouble les hommes de voir une femme sortir son jardin (pour montrer ses parties intimes), demandez aux hommes ils vous le diront. Dieu a dit qu'une femme ne devrait pas revêtir ce qui appartient à un homme et que l'homme ne devrait pas non plus revêtir ce qui appartient à la femme.  **\nSlip Skirt  ouverture du dos et du devant de votre jupe, pendant que vous marchez, il y a des ouvertures sur votre jupe qui vous exposent, lorsque vous vous penchez, les hommes vont regarder et convoiter. Vous les faites pécher. Vous êtes également coupable.  **\nMini jupe   il ne faut même pas s'arrêter à genoux ou même si ça passe un peu c'est pas bien. Vous qui souillez la sainteté d'un autre homme, vous n'êtes pas saint non plus.  **\n \nLa jupe ajustée   Si vous êtes du genre pieux qui dit que vous ne portez pas de pantalon, mais qui collectionne pourtant les mini-jupes ou les jupes fendues de Satan, vous êtes pareil avec la femme qui porte un pantalon. Tout est pareil, vous n'êtes pas à l'abri de l'enfer.  **\n \nComment devrait être notre jupe ?   **\nVotre jupe doit être suffisamment longue pour que \"Lorsque vous vous asseyez, vos genoux ne doivent pas être vus . Si vous exposez votre corps et que les gens le voient et vous convoitent, alors vous n'irez pas au paradis puisque vous empêchez les gens de faire le paradis Si vous pensez que vous pouvez fermer vos jambes lorsque vous vous asseyez avec votre mini-jupe, le diable qui vous donne cette mini-jupe vous fera également ouvrir ces jambes.\nMême le chœur aujourd'hui est utilisé par le diable. Les églises meurent aujourd'hui à cause des femmes. Il ne devrait pas l'être. C'est pourquoi la gloire de Dieu quitte l'église. Les femmes s'assoient avec des minijupes et exposent des parties secrètes de leur corps. Attention les femmes ! La première femme a apporté un problème à l'humanité. Que Dieu nous délivre des femmes. Laissez chaque femme vérifier sa jupe et apporter des corrections, si vous voulez aller au paradis.  **\n \nBody Fitd Cloth   Ne les suivez pas. Les robes des femmes ont changé ! Votre robe ne doit pas tenir votre corps comme celle des mécréants. Ne montrez pas votre poitrine, votre dos, tout. Lorsque certaines femmes portent des vêtements, c'est comme si le tissu se cassait. Habillez-vous correctement s'il vous plaît.  **\n \nLinge à manches courtes   ne montrez votre aisselle à personne. Personne n'est intéressé. Le chiffon à main courte doit être modifié pour atteindre le coude. Robe courte   Ce n'est pas pour une femme pieuse. Habillez-vous bien et oubliez d'utiliser un mouchoir pour couvrir une partie du corps.  **\n \nDeep Cut Dress   Si vous montrez votre poitrine à travers une robe impie, vous périrez avec eux. Si vous suivez le monde, méfiez-vous, il y a un esprit qui les conduit en enfer. Si vous voyez une sœur dans une communauté, un lieu ou une église, demandez-lui gentiment d'aller se changer. Ne te tais plus. Nombres 25 verset 6 à 16. Ne vous asseyez pas n'importe comment dans l'église et ne vous habillez pas n'importe comment, cela peut chasser certains hommes de l'église, certaines femmes, en particulier les filles, sont des agents. Ne soyez pas utilisé par le diable.  **\n\nNe vous teignez pas les cheveux    **\nMatthieu 5 verset 36  **\nTu ne jureras pas non plus par ta tête, car tu ne peux rendre un seul cheveu blanc ou noir.  **\nRomains 1 verset 25  **\n« Qui a changé la vérité de Dieu en mensonge, et a adoré et servi la créature plus que le Créateur, qui est béni éternellement.\nAmen.\" \nComment la fidélité de Dieu vous a gardé. Changer de coiffure est un mensonge. Le parfum n'est pas bon pour être utilisé par un croyant. La source vient du royaume de Satan. Les chiens et les chats ne l'utilisent pas à cause de leur odeur, pourquoi les êtres humains ?  **\n Esaïe 3 verset 16 à 24  **\n« De plus, l'Éternel dit   Parce que les filles de Sion sont hautaines, et marchent le cou allongé et les yeux impudiques, marchant et hachant en marchant, et faisant tinter leurs pieds ;\nC'est pourquoi l'Éternel frappera d'une croûte le sommet de la tête des filles de Sion, et l'Éternel découvrira leurs parties secrètes.\nEn ce jour-là, le Seigneur leur enlèvera la bravoure de leurs ornements tintants autour de leurs pieds, et leurs coiffes, et leurs pneus ronds comme la lune,\nLes chaînes, et les bracelets, et les cache-nez,\nLes bonnets, et les ornements des jambes, et les bandeaux, et les tablettes, et les boucles d'oreilles, stomacher une ceinture de toile à sac ; et brûlant au lieu de la beauté.\nLes bagues et bijoux de nez,\nLes vêtements changeants, et les manteaux, et les guimpes, et les pinces à linge, Les lunettes, et le linge fin, et les capuchons, et les voiles. Et il arrivera qu'au lieu d'une odeur agréable, il y aura de la puanteur; et au lieu d'une ceinture une déchirure; et au lieu d'une calvitie bien établie; et au lieu d'un ventre un ceinturage\nde toile à sac ; et brûlant au lieu de la beauté.  **\nQue Dieu délivre cette génération d'une si mauvaise attitude en\nNom de Jésus. Amin  **\n \nConclusion    **\nPour vous parer de vêtements modestes, en évitant la permanente, le jerry curling (coiffure), l'utilisation d'attaches pour cheveux, laine, WEAVON (coiffure impie), teinture, boucles d'oreilles, chaînes, collier, bracelets, anneaux de nez, alliance, bague de fiançailles, cortex, rouges à lèvres, pantalons, blanchiment, robe courte, jupes courtes, câlin corporel et toutes sortes de robes et de biens séduisants.  **\nPremier Timothée 2 verset 8 à 10  **\n\" Je veux donc que les hommes prient partout, en élevant des mains saintes, sans colère ni doute.\nDe la même manière aussi, que les femmes se parent d'habits modestes, avec pudeur et sobriété ; pas avec des cheveux tressés, ou de l'or, ou des perles, ou une parure coûteuse;\nMais (ce qui convient aux femmes professant la piété) avec de bonnes œuvres.  **\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 3 à 5  **\n« Dont la parure ne soit pas cette parure extérieure de tresser les cheveux, et de porter de l'or, ou de se vêtir ;\nMais que ce soit l'homme caché du cœur, dans ce qui n'est pas corruptible, même l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille, qui est aux yeux de Dieu d'un grand prix.\nCar de cette manière dans les temps anciens aussi les saintes femmes, qui se confiaient en Dieu, se paraient elles-mêmes, étant soumises à leurs propres maris   » Que Dieu te bénisse.\n \n \n\n",

Fais-moi haïr le péché et la méchanceté. Laissez-moi détester voir le péché dans ma vie. Laissez-moi détester voir le péché aussi dans la vie des autres. Ceux qui t'aiment détestent le mal. Seigneur, je ne laisserai pas le péché entrer dans ma vie. Je désire éliminer le péché de la vie des autres. Père divin, nous honorons Jésus. Dieu, quand Jésus était sur terre, tu as vu en lui une justice parfaite; vous avez vu une œuvre parfaite contre la méchanceté dans son sacrifice. L'onction que vous lui avez donnée était au-dessus de tous ses semblables, quand il était un homme avec nous. C'est ce que vous faites lorsque vous trouvez quelqu'un qui se consacre à vous dans la droiture et la sainteté. Vous exaltez une telle personne, car la justice honore un homme. Tu l'oins d'une huile de joie au-dessus de ses compagnons. Dieu, je m'engage à être juste, à te servir dans la sainteté. Je me suis engagé à haïr le péché, à travailler contre le péché. Le péché a été expié par Jésus-Christ afin que les pécheurs soient sauvés et purifiés Seigneur, sois avec moi dans ma détermination à être saint et irréprochable devant Toi tous les jours de ma vie sur terre. Merci de m'avoir répondu, au nom de Jésus .\nCe livre est comme une route construite à travers la Bible pour tous les hommes qui désirent servir Dieu d'une manière vraie et sainte à suivre. Il servira à diriger les pieds des croyants sur le chemin de la justice, de la vérité et de la sainteté. Il offre au disciple sincère du Seigneur Jésus-Christ     **\n\nDe quoi croire au milieu des diverses doctrines dans l'église.   **\n-\tExemples à suivre dans la pratique de la justice et de la sainteté.  **\n-\tQue prêcher en tant que ministre vrai et fidèle qui désire conduire les gens au ciel.  **\nBeaucoup de gens croient qu'il n'est pas possible de vivre la vie sainte, mais ce livre vous montrera que la sainteté de vie est pratiquement possible de nos jours comme aux jours de la Bible.

J'ai trouvé, signifie que je l'ai cherché. Je l'ai cherché et enfin je l'ai trouvé. Un homme selon mon cœur signifie que son cœur est sur moi et qu'il fera tout mon plaisir. David était un homme dédié à Dieu dans la vie et le service. Il était audacieux et courageux et Dieu l'a utilisé comme vase d' honneur .  **\n2 Timothée 2 verset 19 à 21   **\n« Néanmoins, le fondement de Dieu demeure assuré, ayant ce sceau   Le Seigneur connaît ceux qui sont à lui. Et, Que quiconque nomme le \nnom de Christ s'éloigne de l'iniquité. Mais dans une grande maison, il n'y a pas seulement des vases d'or et d'argent, mais aussi de bois et de terre ; et certains à honorer , et certains à déshonorer .\nSi donc un homme se purge de ceux-ci, il sera un vase d' honneur , sanctifié et propre à l'usage du maître, et préparé à toute bonne œuvre.''  **\nLa Bible nous donne des récits d'hommes et de femmes qui ont obtenu grâce devant Dieu. La Bible nous montre aussi pourquoi certaines de ces personnes ont trouvé grâce aux yeux de Dieu. Dieu est le même en nature et en attribut depuis le début de sa révélation à l'homme jusqu'à maintenant. Il y a des choses qui le provoquent en jugement contre les hommes et il y a des choses qui le poussent à aimer et font que les hommes obtiennent grâce à ses yeux. Nous ferons une brève étude de certains saints de la Bible en mettant l'accent sur les raisons pour lesquelles ils ont obtenu la grâce aux yeux de Dieu.  **\n\n1. ÉNOCH   **\nGenèse 5 verset 21 à 24.  **\n«Et Hénoc vécut soixante-cinq ans, et engendra Mathusalem, et Hénoc marcha avec Dieu après avoir engendré Mathusalem trois cents ans, et engendra des fils et des filles. Et tous les jours d'Enoch furent de trois cent soixante-cinq ans. Et Enoch marchait avec Dieu   et il n'était pas ; car Dieu l'a pris.  **\n\nCe n'est pas courant, mon frère. Ce n'est pas courant, ma sœur   combien de personnes ont été ainsi prises par Dieu ? Il y avait une raison pour laquelle Enoch trouva grâce aux yeux de Dieu. L'Ecriture le donne comme suit   Hénoc marchait avec Dieu.\nTrouver grâce aux yeux de Dieu vient avec la justice. Tu aimes la justice et tu détestes la méchanceté, c'est pourquoi Dieu, ton Dieu t'a oint d'une huile de joie au-dessus de tes semblables.  **\n2. NOÉ   **\nGenèse 6 verset 5 à 8.  **\n« Et DIEU vit que la méchanceté de l'homme était grande sur la terre, et que toute imagination des pensées de son cœur n'était continuellement que mauvaise.\nEt cela repentit l'Éternel d'avoir fait l'homme sur la terre, et cela l'attrista au cœur.\nEt l'Éternel dit  Je détruirai l'homme que j'ai créé de la face de la terre; à la fois l'homme et la bête, et la chose rampante, et les oiseaux du ciel; car je me repens de les avoir faits.\n Mais Noé trouva grâce aux yeux des SEIGNEUR .  **\nIl n'est pas courant d'obtenir cette grâce spéciale que Noé avait du Seigneur. La grâce de Dieu est certes apparue à tous les hommes, mais tous ne la trouvent pas, tous ne se soucient pas de la trouver. Tous les hommes ne trouvent pas cette grâce spéciale que Noé a trouvée aux yeux de Dieu. Pourquoi Noé a-t-il trouvé grâce aux yeux de l'Éternel? Voyez ci-dessous ce que l'Ecriture dit de Noé   **\n\nGenèse 6 verset 9   **\n\"Ce sont les générations de Noé, Noé était un homme juste et parfait dans ses générations, et Noé a marché avec Dieu.\"  **\nGenèse 7 verset 1   **\n« Et l'Éternel dit à Noé   Viens, toi et toute ta maison, dans l'arche ; car je t'ai vu juste devant moi dans cette génération.''  **\nNous pouvons voir par les Écritures que Noé a trouvé grâce aux yeux de Dieu à cause de sa vie juste et parfaite.  **\n\n. ABRAHAM   **\nAbraham a trouvé grâce aux yeux du Seigneur. Il obtint un titre spécial et un honneur , car il fut appelé, L'ami de Dieu.  **\nJacques 2 verset 23   **\n\"Et s'accomplit l'Ecriture qui dit  Abraham crut à Dieu, et cela lui fut imputé à justice; et il fut appelé l'ami de Dieu.\"  **\n\nL'Écriture révèle ce qui a fait qu'Abraham a trouvé cette grâce particulière dans sa marche avec Dieu.  **\nGenèse 15 versets 5 et 6.  **\n«Et il le fit sortir, et dit  Regarde maintenant vers le ciel, et dis les étoiles, si tu peux les compter; et il lui dit  Ainsi sera ta postérité.\nEt il crut au SEIGNEUR; et il le lui imputa à justice. ”  **\n Romains 4 verset 19 à 22   **\n\"Et n'étant pas faible dans la foi, il ne considérait pas son propre corps maintenant mort, alors qu'il avait environ cent ans, ni encore la mort du ventre de Sara \nIl n'a pas chancelé devant la promesse de Dieu par incrédulité ; mais était fort dans la foi, rendant gloire à Dieu;\nEt étant pleinement persuadé que ce qu'il avait promis, il pouvait aussi l'accomplir.\nEt c'est pourquoi cela lui a été imputé à justice.  **\n\nDieu était sans aucun doute ravi par la foi solide qu'Abraham avait envers Lui. Il avait trouvé un homme à emmener avec lui dans la marche de la foi ; car sans la foi, il est impossible de plaire à Dieu. Non seulement Abraham était fort dans la foi, mais Dieu était persuadé d'Abraham qu'il garderait sa famille et sa maison en ordre, à cause des activités pieuses et de la vie exemplaire qu'il avait déployées devant eux.  **\nGenèse 18 verset 17 à 19   **\n« Et l'Éternel dit   Cacherai-je à Abraham ce que je fais ?\nVoyant qu'Abraham deviendra sûrement une nation grande et puissante, et que toutes les nations de la terre seront bénies en lui ?\nCar je le connais, qu'il commandera à ses enfants et à sa maison après lui, et qu'ils garderont le chemin de l'Éternel, pour pratiquer la justice et le jugement; afin que l'Éternel fasse venir sur Abraham ce qu'il a dit de lui.  **\n\nGarder vos enfants et votre famille dans la justice de Dieu vous permet de trouver grâce aux yeux de Dieu. Il y a encore une autre chose qui a permis à Abraham de gagner la faveur de Dieu. C'était son obéissance peu commune aux commandements de Dieu.  **\n\nGenèse 22 verset 1 à 2,9 à 12,15 à 18.  **\n« Et il arriva, après ces choses, que Dieu tenta Abraham, et lui dit   Abraham ; et il dit   Me voici, et il dit   Prends maintenant ton fils, ton fils unique Isaac, que tu aimes , et entre dans le pays de Moriah; et offre-le là en holocauste sur l'une des montagnes que je te dirai.\nEt ils arrivèrent au lieu que Dieu lui avait dit; et Abraham bâtit là un autel, et rangea le bois, et lia Isaac son fils, et le mit sur l'autel, sur le bois.\nEt Abraham étendit la main et prit le couteau pour tuer son fils.\nEt l'ange de l'Éternel l'appela du ciel, et dit   Abraham, Abraham ! et il dit   Me voici .\nEt il dit   ne pose pas ta main sur l'enfant, et ne lui fais rien ; car maintenant je sais que tu crains Dieu, puisque tu ne m'as pas refusé ton fils, ton fils unique.\nEt l'ange de l'Éternel appela Abraham du ciel une seconde fois,\nEt dit   J'ai juré par moi-même, dit l'Éternel, parce que tu as fait cette chose, et que tu n'as pas retenu ton fils, ton fils unique   17 qu'en bénissant je te bénirai, et en multipliant je multiplierai ta postérité comme les étoiles du ciel, et comme le sable qui est sur le bord de la mer ; et ta postérité possédera la porte de ses ennemis;\nEt en ta postérité toutes les nations de la terre seront bénies; parce que tu as obéi à ma voix.  **\n\nCe n'est pas une simple chose quand vous voyez que quelqu'un a trouvé grâce aux yeux de Dieu. Il y a des sacrifices et des obéissances difficiles accomplis par cet homme pour Dieu. Il y a des actes de justice, de dévouement, de sainteté, d'amour de Dieu exercés et pratiqués par cet homme qui lui ont donné ce type de faveur divine .  **\n4. JOSEPH   **\nGenèse 39 verset 1 à 6.  **\n« Et Joseph fut descendu en Égypte ; et Potiphar, un officier de Pharaon, chef des gardes, un Égyptien, l'acheta des mains des Ismaélites, qui l'avaient fait descendre là.\nEt l'Éternel était avec Joseph, et c'était un homme prospère; et il était dans la maison de son maître l'Egyptien.\nEt son maître vit que l'Éternel était avec lui, et que l'Éternel faisait prospérer entre ses mains tout ce qu'il faisait.\nEt Joseph trouva grâce à ses yeux, et il le servit, et il l'établit sur sa maison, et il mit entre ses mains tout ce qu'il avait. 5 Et il arriva, depuis qu'il l'eut établi sur sa maison et sur tout ce qui lui appartenait, que l'Éternel bénit la maison de l'Égyptien à cause de Joseph ; et la bénédiction de l'Éternel fut sur tout ce qu'il avait dans la maison et dans les champs.\nEt il laissa tout ce qu'il avait entre les mains de Joseph; et il ne savait pas ce qu'il devait avoir , sinon le pain qu'il mangeait. Et Joseph était une bonne personne, et bien favorisé »   **\n\nL'Ecriture ci-dessus nous montre la faveur que Joseph trouva devant son maître Potiphar. C'était une extension de la grâce que Joseph avait trouvée auprès de Dieu. Cette faveur le suivait partout où il allait. Les Écritures suivantes nous disent la raison de la faveur de Dieu sur la vie de Joseph. Joseph aimait la justice et haïssait l'iniquité.  **\nGenèse 37 verset 1 et 2   **\n« Et Jacob habita dans le pays où son père était étranger, au pays de Canaan.\nCe sont les générations de Jacob. Joseph, âgé de dix-sept ans, faisait paître le troupeau avec ses frères; et le garçon était avec les fils de Bilhah et avec les fils de Zilpah , les femmes de son père; et Joseph rapporta à son père leur mauvaise nouvelle.  **\n\nGenèse 39 verset 7 à 12   **\n« Et il arriva, après ces choses, que la femme de son maître jeta les yeux sur Joseph ; et elle dit   Couche avec moi.\nMais il refusa, et dit à la femme de son maître   Voici, mon maître ne sait pas ce qui est avec moi dans la maison, et il m'a confié tout ce qu'il a ;\nIl n'y a personne de plus grand dans cette maison que moi ; et il ne m'a rien caché d'autre que toi, parce que tu es sa femme, comment puis-je faire ce grand mal et pécher contre Dieu ? 10 Et il arriva, comme elle parlait à Joseph jour après jour, qu'il ne l'écoutait pas, pour coucher près d'elle, ou pour être avec elle.\nEt il arriva, à peu près à cette époque, que Joseph entra dans la maison pour faire ses affaires; et il n'y avait là aucun des hommes de la maison à l'intérieur.\nEt elle le saisit par son vêtement, en disant   Couche avec moi ; et il laissa son vêtement dans sa main, et s'enfuit, et le fit sortir.  **\nQuand vous voyez un homme jouir de la faveur divine dans un vrai sens de celle-ci, examinez-le ; entendez parler de lui, vous verrez ce qui suit dans sa vie   une obéissance peu commune, un exercice peu commun de la foi en Christ, une consécration peu commune au SEIGNEUR et des actes de justice peu communs.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 2   ** \nPOURQUOI LES SAINTS DE LA BIBLE ONT TROUVÉ LA GRÂCE À LA VUE DE DIEU PARTIE 2   **\n5. MOÏSE   **\nNombres 12 verset 1 à 4 .  **\n«Et Miriam et Aaron parlèrent contre Moïse à cause de la femme éthiopienne qu'il avait épousée  car il avait épousé une femme éthiopienne.\nEt ils dirent  L'Éternel n'a-t-il vraiment parlé que par Moïse? n'a-t-il pas aussi parlé par nous ? Et l'Éternel l'entendit.\n(Maintenant, l'homme Moïse était très doux, surtout les hommes qui étaient sur la face de la terre. ) 4 Et l'Éternel dit tout à coup à Moïse, et à Aaron, et à Miriam   Sortez vous trois au tabernacle d'assignation. Et ils sont sortis tous les trois.''\n\nOr l'homme Moïse était très doux, au-dessus de tous les hommes qui étaient sur la face de la terre.  **\nPouvez-vous voir cette humilité peu commune chez Moïse ? Moïse\ntrouvé grâce aux yeux de Dieu. L'humilité dans sa vie a occasionné cette grâce qu'il a trouvée aux yeux de Dieu.  **\nNombres 12 verset 5 à 10   **\n« Et l'Éternel descendit dans la colonne de nuée, et se tint à l'entrée du tabernacle, et appela Aaron et Miriam, et ils sortirent tous deux.\nEt il dit  Écoutez maintenant mes paroles  S'il y a un prophète parmi vous, moi, l'Éternel, je me ferai connaître à lui dans une vision, et je lui parlerai en songe.\nIl n'en est pas ainsi de mon serviteur Moïse, qui est fidèle dans toute ma maison.\nAvec lui je parlerai bouche à bouche, même en apparence, et non dans des discours sombres ; et il verra l'image de l'Éternel, pourquoi donc n'avez-vous pas craint de parler contre mon serviteur Moïse? Et la colère de l'Éternel s'enflamma contre eux; et Il est parti.\nEt la nuée se retira de dessus le tabernacle; et voici, Miriam est devenue      lépreux, blanc comme neige et Aaron regarda Miriam, et voici, elle était lépreuse.  **\nMoïse était un prophète, bien sûr, comme Aaron et Miriam. Mais il y avait une distinction entre Moïse et les autres sous lui. Il était fidèle dans toutes les questions de berger et de leadership sur le peuple de Dieu, selon la déclaration de Dieu. C'était comme une surprise pour Dieu qu'Aaron et Miriam puissent parler contre un homme comme Moïse. Dieu les réprimanda ainsi avec colère   « Pourquoi n'avez-vous pas eu peur de parler contre mon serviteur Moïse ? Tu penses qu'il est comme toi ? Tu penses qu'il est au même niveau que toi ? Connaissez-vous sa consécration ? Connaissez-vous son dévouement ? Savez-vous comment il s'est élevé et comment Je le vois et son engagement envers Moi ? Vous ne le respectez pas ?  **\nMiriam a subi le jugement de Dieu à cause de son manque de respect pour Moïse. Nous pouvons voir dans cette Ecriture pourquoi Moïse a obtenu grâce aux yeux de Dieu.  **\n6. EMPLOI   **\nJob 1 verset 1 à 5   **\n« Il y avait un homme dans le pays d' Uts , dont le nom était Job ; et cet homme était parfait et droit, et il craignait Dieu et évitait le mal.\nEt il lui naquit sept fils et trois filles.\nSon bien était aussi de sept mille brebis, et trois mille chameaux, et cinq cents paires de boeufs, et cinq cents ânesses, et une très grande maisonnée; de sorte que cet homme était le plus grand de tous les hommes de l'Orient. ”  **\n\nJob était droit et parfait aux yeux de Dieu. Dieu était très satisfait de lui et lui ouvrit la porte d'une grande richesse et prospérité et il devint le plus grand homme parmi les hommes de l'Orient. Pouvez-vous voir ici que le caractère d'un homme devant Dieu peut lui ouvrir la porte à la prospérité et au progrès au-dessus de ses semblables ? Dieu s'est vanté de Job auprès de Satan à cause de sa justice et de sa sainteté hors du commun sur la terre.  **\nJob 1 verset 8 à 11   **\n« Et l'Éternel dit à Satan   As-tu considéré mon serviteur Job, qu'il n'y a sur la terre aucun homme comme lui, un homme parfait et droit, qui craint Dieu et évite le mal ?\nAlors Satan répondit à l'Éternel, et dit   Est-ce que Job craint Dieu pour rien ?\nN'as-tu pas fait une haie autour de lui, et autour de sa maison, et autour de tout ce qu'il a de tous côtés ? tu as béni l'ouvrage de ses mains, et ses biens se sont accrus dans le pays.\nMais étends ta main maintenant, et touche à tout ce qui lui appartient, et il te maudira en face.  **\n\nDieu a dit à Satan qu'il n'y avait personne sur terre qui pratiquait la justice et la sainteté comme Job. Satan a répondu à Dieu que Job le craignait pour les bénédictions et la protection dont il jouissait de sa part, et que s'il lui était permis de se tempérer avec les bénédictions de Job, le résultat surprendrait Dieu. Dieu a permis à Satan de le faire. Alors Satan est allé contre Job et a détruit sa richesse et ses richesses avec ses enfants. Mais à sa grande surprise, tout cela n'a pas affecté la justice de Job.\nVoici le récit de l'Ecriture   **\nJob 1 verset 20 à 22   **\n\t\"Alors Job se leva, déchira son manteau, se rasa la tête, se prosterna à terre et se prosterna,\n\tEt il dit   Je suis sorti nu du sein de ma mère, et j'y retournerai nu. L'Éternel a donné, et l'Éternel a repris ; béni soit le nom de l'Éternel. ”  **\n\tEn tout cela, Job n'a pas péché, ni n'a accusé Dieu follement.  **\nMaintenant, Dieu était-il justifié pour Job choisi, pour lui avoir donné une prospérité, un progrès, une richesse, une richesse, un honneur et une promotion hors du commun ? Lorsque vous donnez à Dieu une consécration hors du commun, vous recevez une grâce hors du commun. Cette démonstration de justice devant Satan augmenta la vantardise de Dieu sur Job   **\nJob 2 verset 3 à 7   **\n« Et l'Éternel dit à Satan   As-tu considéré mon serviteur Job, qu'il n'y a sur la terre aucun homme comme lui, un homme parfait et droit, qui craint Dieu et évite le mal ? et il tient toujours son intégrité, bien que tu m'aies poussé contre lui, pour le détruire sans cause.\nEt Satan répondit à l'Éternel, et dit  Peau pour peau, oui, tout ce qu'un homme a, il le donnera pour sa vie.\nMaintenant, étends ta main, touche à ses os et à sa chair, et il te maudira en face.\nEt l'Éternel dit à Satan   Voici, il est entre tes mains ; mais sauvez-lui la vie.\nAinsi Satan sortit de la présence de l'Éternel, et frappa Job d'un furoncle douloureux depuis la plante de son pied jusqu'à son sommet .  **\n\nEn plus de frapper Job de maladie, Satan a également employé la femme de Job pour le détourner du Seigneur. Mais tout cela n'a pas réussi à détourner Job de la justice de Dieu.  **\n\nJob 2 verset 9 et 10   **\n« Alors sa femme lui dit   Gardes-tu encore ton intégrité ? maudis Dieu et meurs. Mais il lui dit   Tu parles comme parle une femme insensée . Quoi? Recevrons-nous le bien de la main de Dieu, et ne recevrons-nous pas le mal ? En tout cela, Job n'a pas péché avec ses lèvres.  **\nIl y a quelques hommes et femmes qui ont cette consécration de Jobs devant le Seigneur, mais vous ne les connaissez peut-être pas. Le Seigneur peut les révéler par sa parole prophétique ou par ses bénédictions exceptionnelles sur leur vie. Cela signifie que Dieu peut donner un tel appel ministériel et une onction peu communs. Veillez à ne pas être du côté de l'incrédulité, de la critique et de l'insubordination envers de tels oints de Dieu à cause de petites fautes, ou de ouï-dire, ou d'une langue médisante contre eux. Job a surmonté toutes les ruses sataniques que Dieu a permis d'éprouver sa foi. Il a maintenu la justice et une confiance totale en Dieu. Par conséquent, le Seigneur a doublé ses bénédictions et lui a accordé un ministère parmi les hommes jusqu'à ce jour, bien qu'il soit mort.  **\n\nJob 27 verset 3 à 6   **\n\t« Pendant tout ce temps, mon souffle est en moi, et l'esprit de Dieu est dans mes narines ;\n\tMes lèvres ne diront pas de méchanceté, ni ma langue de pure tromperie.\n\tDieu me garde de te justifier   jusqu'à ma mort, je ne m'ôterai pas mon intégrité.\n\tJe retiens ma justice et je ne la lâcherai pas   mon cœur ne me reprochera rien tant que je vivrai. ”  **\n\nJob 42 verset 12,13,16 et 17   **\n\t« Ainsi l'Éternel a béni la dernière fin de Job plus que son commencement ; car il avait quatorze mille brebis, et six mille chameaux, et mille paires de boeufs, et mille ânesses.\n\tIl avait aussi sept fils et trois filles. 16 Après cela, Job vécut cent quarante ans, et vit ses fils et les fils de ses fils, quatre générations.\n Alors Job mourut, étant vieux et plein de jours.  **\n\n7. DANIEL   **\nDaniel 1 verset 8.  **\n\" Mais Daniel avait résolu dans son cœur de ne pas se souiller avec la portion de la viande du roi, ni avec le vin qu'il buvait   c'est pourquoi il demanda au prince des eunuques de ne pas se souiller.\"\nVous pouvez voir ici la consécration de Daniel à Dieu et la pureté de sa vie. Son style de vie a influencé les trois autres enfants hébreux Shadrach, Meshach et Abednego. Leur détermination à maintenir une vie sans souillure entraînait le risque de leur vie. Mais à la fin, Dieu les a hautement bénis.  **\n\nDaniel 1 verset 18 à 20   **\n\t«Or, à la fin des jours où le roi avait dit qu'il les ferait entrer, alors le prince des eunuques les fit entrer devant\nNabuchodonosor.\n\tEt le roi communia avec eux; et parmi eux tous ne se trouvèrent aucun comme Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael et Azariah  ils se tinrent donc devant le roi.\n\tEt dans toutes les questions de sagesse et d'intelligence que le roi leur demandait, il les trouvait dix fois meilleurs que tous les magiciens et astrologues qui étaient dans tout son royaume. ”  **\nLa justice de Daniel a encore été contestée sous le gouvernement de Darius. À cause de Daniel, un décret a été rendu que personne ne devrait prier un autre Dieu que le roi Darius pendant trente jours. La peine pour avoir désobéi à ce décret était la mort dans la fosse aux lions. Daniel a ignoré leur menace et a maintenu sa justice devant Dieu.  **\n\nDaniel 6 verset 10   **\n« Or , quand Daniel sut que l'écrit était signé, il entra dans sa maison ; et ses fenêtres étant ouvertes dans sa chambre vers Jérusalem, il s'agenouilla sur ses genoux trois fois par jour, et priait, et rendait grâces devant son Dieu, comme il le faisait auparavant.\nLa grande délivrance des lions qui a suivi la confiance totale de Daniel en Dieu a apporté une grande gloire et une grande promotion au nom du Seigneur.  **\nDaniel 6 verset 25 à 27   **\n\t« Alors le roi Darius écrivit à tous les peuples, nations et langues qui habitent sur toute la terre ; Que la paix vous soit multipliée.\n\tJe décrète que , dans chaque domaine de mon royaume, les hommes tremblent et craignent devant le Dieu de Daniel, car il est le Dieu vivant, et ferme à jamais, et son royaume ne sera pas détruit, et sa domination sera jusqu'à la fin.\n\tIl délivre et sauve , et il opère des signes et des prodiges dans les cieux et sur la terre, qui a délivré Daniel de la puissance des lions.  **\n\nDaniel a trouvé grâce aux yeux de Dieu qui l'a rempli de connaissance, de sagesse et de compréhension. Il était très aimé de son Dieu à cause de sa justice et de sa foi hors du commun en Dieu. Voir la façon particulière dont l'Ecriture s'adressait à Daniel     **\n\nDaniel 10 verset 11 et 19   **\n« Et il me dit   Ô Daniel, homme bien-aimé, comprends les paroles que je te dis, et tiens-toi droit, car je suis maintenant envoyé vers toi. Et quand il m'eut dit cette parole, je restai tremblant.\nEt dit   Ô homme bien-aimé, n'aie pas peur ; la paix soit avec toi, sois fort, oui, sois fort. Et quand il m'eut parlé, je fus fortifié, et je dis   Que mon seigneur parle ; car tu m'as fortifié.\nUn homme très aimé ! Quelle grâce rare il avait trouvée devant Dieu pour la démonstration de la justice et de la sainteté dans les endroits difficiles et dans les moments difficiles !  **\n\nCHAPITRE 3   ** \nPOURQUOI LES SAINTS DE LA BIBLE ONT TROUVÉ LA GRÂCE AUX VEUX DE DIEU PARTIE 3.  **\n MARIE LA MERE DE JESUS.  **\nLuc 1 verset 26 à 28.  **\n\t« Et le sixième mois, l'ange Gabriel fut envoyé par Dieu dans une ville de Galilée, nommée Nazareth,\n\tA une vierge fiancée à un homme dont le nom était Joseph, de la maison de David; et le nom de la vierge était Marie.\n\tEt l'ange vint vers elle, et dit   Je te salue, toi qui es hautement favorisée , le Seigneur est\navec toi; tu es bénie entre les femmes. Toi qui es hautement favorisé  ”   **\nMarie était hautement favorisée par Dieu. Elle a été choisie par Dieu pour être celle qui enfantera le Christ, le Fils du Dieu vivant, le Sauveur de l'humanité. Qu'est-ce qui a motivé cette faveur ? Sûrement sa justice et sa sainteté. C'était une vierge qui n'avait jamais connu d'homme, à cause de la crainte de Dieu. La piété de Marie peut être comprise par Joseph, l'homme qui lui était fiancé.  **\nMatthieu 1 verset 19 à 20   **\n« Alors Joseph, son mari, étant un homme juste et ne voulant pas en faire un exemple public, voulut la répudier en secret.\nMais pendant qu'il réfléchissait à ces choses, voici, l'ange du Seigneur lui apparut en songe, disant   Joseph, fils de David, ne crains pas de prendre Marie, ta femme ; car ce qui est conçu en elle vient du Saint-Esprit. Joseph était un homme juste et appliqué dans la justice. Cela nous a montré comment était Mary.  **\n\n9. L'APÔTRE PAUL.  **\nL'apôtre Paul était un homme qui a obtenu une grande grâce aux yeux de Dieu. Dieu lui a donné d'abondantes révélations concernant l'Église du Christ.  **\n2 Corinthiens 12 verset 7   **\n\"Et de peur que je ne sois exalté au-dessus de toute mesure par l'abondance des révélations, il m'a été donné une écharde dans la chair, le messager de Satan pour me frapper, de peur que je ne sois exalté au-dessus de toute mesure.\"  **\n\nL'apôtre Paul a également témoigné que bien qu'il soit le moindre de tous les apôtres, par la grâce de Dieu qui lui a été accordée, il a travaillé plus qu'eux tous.  **\n1 Corinthiens 15 verset 10   **\n  « Mais par la grâce de Dieu je suis ce que je suis ; et sa grâce qui m'a été accordée n'a pas été vaine; mais j'ai travaillé plus abondamment qu'eux tous, cependant pas moi, mais la grâce de Dieu qui était avec moi.  **\nIl a écrit quatorze des vingt-sept livres du Nouveau Testament. Plusieurs raisons expliquent cette grâce qu'il trouva devant Dieu   il était humble, zélé, passionné, cédant à la souffrance et à la persécution. Au-dessus de tout cela, il était juste et saint. Écoutez son témoignage     **\nActes 23 verset 1   **\n\"Et Paul, regardant attentivement le conseil, dit  Hommes et frères, j'ai vécu en toute bonne conscience devant Dieu jusqu'à ce jour.\"  **\nActes 24 verset 16   **\n\"Et c'est en cela que je m'exerce à avoir toujours une conscience sans offense envers Dieu et envers les hommes.\"  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 2 verset 10   **\n« Vous êtes témoins, et Dieu aussi, de la sainteté, de la justice et de l'irréprochabilité que nous nous sommes comportés parmi vous qui croyez   »  **\nLe Seigneur est avec les justes. Il accorde sa grâce pour une fonction et un service spéciaux à des hommes et des femmes saints.  **\n \nPsaumes 18 verset 24   **\n« C'est pourquoi l'Éternel m'a rendu selon ma justice, selon la pureté de mes mains à ses yeux.  **\nPurifiez-vous du péché et soyez un vase d'honneur pour le Seigneur pour ses usages honorables . Arrêtez d'envier les autres comme Caïn l'a fait contre Abel.  **\n \nGenèse 4 verset 3 à 7   **\n\t« Et avec le temps, il arriva que Caïn apporta du fruit de la terre en offrande à l'Éternel. \n\tEt Abel, il apporta aussi des premiers-nés de son troupeau et de leur graisse. Et l'Éternel eut égard à Abel et à son offrande.\n\tMais à Caïn et à son offrande, il n'avait pas de respect. Et Caïn était très en colère, et son visage tomba.\n\tEt l'Éternel dit à Caïn   Pourquoi es-tu irrité ? et pourquoi ton visage est-il tombé?\n\tSi tu fais bien, ne seras-tu pas accepté ? et si tu ne fais pas bien, le péché est à la porte. Et vers toi sera son désir, et tu domineras sur lui.  **\n10. \tL'HOMME CHRIST JESUS   **\nHébreux 1 verset 8 et 9   **\n\t«Mais il dit au Fils  Ton trône, ô Dieu, est pour toujours et à jamais  un sceptre de justice est le sceptre de ton royaume.\n\tTu as aimé la justice et haï l'iniquité; c'est pourquoi Dieu, ton Dieu, t'a oint d'une huile de joie au-dessus de tes compagnons. ”  **\n\nCette Ecriture montre que Jésus-Christ est Dieu éternel et un avec le Père. Il était la Parole faite chair qui habitait parmi nous.  **\nJean 1 verset 1 et 14   **\n« Au commencement était la Parole, et la Parole était avec Dieu, et la Parole était Dieu.\nEt le Verbe s'est fait chair, et a habité parmi nous, (et nous avons contemplé sa gloire, la gloire comme du Fils unique du Père, plein de grâce et de vérité\".\n\nDieu l'a oint d'une huile d'allégresse au-dessus de ses compagnons, parce qu'il aimait la justice et haïssait l'iniquité. Écoutez ce que Jésus Lui-même a dit     **\nJean 15 verset 10   **\n« Si vous gardez mes commandements, vous demeurerez dans mon amour ; de même que j'ai gardé les commandements de mon Père et que je demeure dans son amour.  **\nJean 8 verset 29   **\n« Et celui qui m'a envoyé est avec moi   le Père ne m'a pas laissé seul ; car je fais toujours les choses qui lui plaisent.  **\n\nJésus a dit que la raison pour laquelle il demeurait dans l'amour du Père était parce qu'il gardait ses commandements et faisait toujours les choses qui lui plaisaient.\nDieu a donné à l'homme Jésus le plus grand nom de l'univers à cause de son obéissance totale au Père.  **\nPhilippiens 2 verset 5 à 11   **\n\t« Que cette pensée soit en vous, qui était aussi en Jésus-Christ  \n\tQui, étant sous la forme de Dieu, pensait que ce n'était pas un vol d'être égal à Dieu  \n\tMais s'est fait sans réputation, et a pris sur lui la forme d'un se\n\tEt étant trouvé à la mode en tant qu'homme, il s'est humilié et est devenu obéissant jusqu'à la mort, même la mort de la croix.\n\tC'est pourquoi Dieu aussi l'a souverainement élevé et lui a donné un nom qui est au-dessus de tout nom  \n\tQu'au Nom de Jésus tout genou fléchisse, des choses dans les cieux, et des choses sur la terre, et des choses sous la terre; 11 Et que toute langue confesse que Jésus-Christ est Seigneur, à la gloire de Dieu le Père.  **\nLe nom de Jésus lui a été donné à cause de sa justice et de ses actes d'obéissance devant Dieu.  **\nLes dons et l'appel de Dieu\nLes dons et l'appel de Dieu ne sont-ils pas par grâce et sa prescience ? L'homme doit-il jouer un rôle pour eux ? Oui, mais la grâce est reçue par la foi et établie par les œuvres.\nEphésiens 2 verset 8 et 9   **\n« Car c'est par la grâce que vous êtes sauvés par la foi ; et cela pas de vous-mêmes; c'est le don de Dieu;\nPas d'œuvres, de peur qu'aucun homme ne se glorifie.\n\nSi Dieu a appelé ou choisi quelqu'un, soit dès la naissance, soit par prophétie, soit par une autre voie divine pour utiliser et réaliser Son dessein, si cela a à voir avec Ses enfants, l'œuvre de justice est nécessaire pour établir un tel don et appel.  **\nJacques 2 verset 20 à 22   **\n\t« Mais sauras-tu, ô homme vain, que la foi sans les œuvres est morte ?\n\tAbraham notre père n'a-t-il pas été justifié par les œuvres, lorsqu'il a offert Isaac son fils sur l'autel ?\n\tVois -tu comment la foi a produit ses œuvres, et par les œuvres la foi a-t-elle été rendue parfaite ?  **\nGenèse 18 verset 17 à 19.  **\n\t« Et l'Éternel dit   Cacherai-je à Abraham ce que je fais ?\n\tVoyant qu'Abraham deviendra sûrement une nation grande et puissante, et que toutes les nations de la terre seront bénies en lui ?\n\tCar je le connais, qu'il commandera à ses enfants et à sa maison après lui, et qu'ils garderont le chemin de l'Éternel, pour pratiquer la justice et le jugement; afin que l'Éternel fasse venir sur Abraham ce qu'il a dit de lui. ”  **\nJérémie 18 verset 9 et 10   **\n\t« Et à quel instant je parlerai d'une nation, et d'un royaume, pour le bâtir et le planter ;\n\tS'il fait du mal à mes yeux, s'il n'obéit pas à ma voix, alors je me repentirai du bien dont j'ai dit que je leur ferais du bien.  **\n\nPremier Samuel 13 verset 13 et 14   **\n «Et Samuel dit à Saül  Tu as fait une folie; tu n'as pas gardé le commandement de l'Éternel, ton Dieu, qu'il t'a prescrit; car maintenant l'Éternel veut établir ton royaume sur Israël pour toujours .\nMais maintenant ton royaume ne durera pas, l'Éternel a cherché un homme selon son cœur, et l'Éternel lui a ordonné d'être le chef de son peuple, parce que tu n'as pas observé ce que l'Éternel t'avait commandé. ”  **\nLes Écritures ci-dessus et plusieurs de leurs genres suffiront à cet égard.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 4   ** \nL'APPEL ET LE MINISTERE DU PASTEUR PAUL RIKA  **\n\nMoi, le pasteur Paul Rika, j'ai obtenu la grâce aux yeux de Dieu de me voir confier la direction de ce grand et spécial ministère de la fin des temps, le Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. Le Seigneur a dit de diverses manières et fois que ce ministère est le sien, qu'il est le fondateur divin et que je suis son représentant humain. Le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté est non confessionnel et cherche à amener toutes les églises du Christ sur terre à l'unité de la foi et à faire revivre la justice et la sainteté bibliques parmi les croyants. Je confesserai comme Paul l'Apôtre selon les Ecritures suivantes   **\n1 Thessaloniciens 2 verset 10   **\n« Vous êtes témoins, et Dieu aussi, de la sainteté, de la justice et de l'irréprochabilité que nous nous sommes comportés parmi vous qui croyez »   **\nMaintenant, je vous ai apporté tout cela pour vous dire   « Moi, Pasteur Paul Rika, je me suis gardé, ainsi que ma famille, dans l'amour et la pureté de Dieu. Etant convaincu qu'aucun homme sur terre ne peut vraiment rendre compte du péché et de la rébellion contre Dieu et contre les Saintes Écritures dans ma vie. Je suis très confiant que personne, nulle part, ne peut se lever et vraiment dire   « Pasteur Rika, vous avez fait ce mal, je vous ai trouvé en train de commettre tel ou tel péché » ; pourtant tu prétends être un enfant de Dieu, un homme de Dieu.”, Personne.  **\n\nMon travail avec le gouvernement   **\nJ'ai travaillé avec le gouvernement de mon état en tant que comptable pendant environ cinq ans. J'ai retiré mon service à cause de l'appel de Dieu au ministère chrétien. Ma conscience n'a aucune trace de mensonge, de fraude ou de toute infraction contre le gouvernement qui a blasphémé le nom du Seigneur et réfuté ma revendication chrétienne.  **\n\nRomains 9 verset 1.  **\n« Je dis la vérité en Christ, je ne mens pas, ma conscience m'en rend aussi témoignage dans le Saint-Esprit »,  **\n\nRaisons de ce témoignage   **\nRaison 1, j'ai en effet trouvé grâce aux yeux de Dieu pour diriger ce ministère de la fin des temps, le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde. Je veux que les gens sachent que c'est purement l'œuvre de la miséricorde, de la grâce et du choix divins. C'est un appel spirituel et il est dépourvu de sagesse humaine, de politicaillerie et de lutte.  **\nEphésiens 3 verset 7 à 8.  **\n« Dont j'ai été fait ministre, selon le don de la grâce de Dieu qui m'a été donné par l'action efficace de sa puissance. \nA moi, qui suis moins que le moindre de tous les saints, cette grâce est donnée de prêcher parmi les Gentils les richesses insondables de Christ ;  **\nRaison 2, j'ai vu que beaucoup de gens se sont consacrés à Satan pour être utilisés par lui contre moi dans toutes sortes de critiques, calomnies, chantages et injures. Certaines de ces personnes ignorent ce qu'elles font, tandis que d'autres le font exprès. Par ce témoignage, j'espère leur ouvrir les yeux sur l'erreur de leurs voies.  **\nLuc 23 verset 34   **\n« Alors Jésus dit   Père, pardonne-leur ; car ils ne savent pas ce qu'ils font. Et ils se partagèrent son vêtement et tirèrent au sort.  **\nRaison 4, parce que ces traîtres ont dit toutes sortes de choses à travers les médias sociaux contre moi et le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté, ils ont fait trébucher beaucoup dans la foi et plusieurs personnes ont endurci leur cœur au message et à la révélation que Dieu donne à travers cette fin Mouvement de sainteté du temps. Certains sont déjà détournés de ce Mouvement à cause de ce qu'ils ont entendu. Par ce témoignage personnel, j'espère ramener ces personnes à la foi en Christ et à la vie de justice et de sainteté requises pour le ciel.  **\n\nGalates 2 verset 4 et 5   **\n\t« Et cela à cause de faux frères introduits à l'improviste, qui sont venus en secret pour espionner notre liberté que nous avons en Jésus-Christ, afin de nous réduire en esclavage ;\n\tA qui nous avons cédé la place par sujétion, non, pas pour une heure ; que la vérité de l'évangile puisse continuer avec vous. ”  **\n2 Timothée 2 verset 25 et 26   **\n« Dans la douceur, instruisant ceux qui s'opposent à eux-mêmes ; si Dieu peut-être leur donnera la repentance pour reconnaître la vérité ;\nEt afin qu'ils se relèvent du piège du diable, qui sont capturés par lui selon sa volonté.  **\n\nRaison 4, Ce témoignage personnel est destiné à fournir des réponses aux questions qui sont dans le cœur de beaucoup concernant moi-même, le pasteur Paul Rika et Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. Ils connaîtront la vérité et seront rendus libres.  **\nJean 8 verset 32   **\nEt vous connaîtrez la vérité, et la vérité vous affranchira.  **\nRaison 5, Ce témoignage personnel est destiné à amener ceux qui aiment Dieu et sa parole de vérité, de justice et de sainteté, son fidèle serviteur et le ministère de la sainteté à résister aux mauvais ouvriers et à prier contre leurs œuvres en cette fin des temps.  **\nMatthieu 7 verset 15 et 17   **\n\t« Méfiez-vous des faux prophètes, qui viennent à vous en vêtements de brebis, mais au dedans ce sont des loups ravisseurs.\n\tVous les reconnaîtrez à leurs fruits. Les hommes cueillent-ils des raisins d' épines, ou des figues de chardons ?\nDe même tout bon arbre produit de bons fruits ; mais un arbre corrompu produit de mauvais fruits.  **\n \n2 Corinthiens 11 verset 13 à 15   **\n\t« Car tels sont de faux apôtres, des ouvriers trompeurs, se transformant en apôtres de Christ.\n\tEt pas étonnant; car Satan lui-même est transformé en ange de lumière.\n Par conséquent , ce n'est pas grand-chose si ses ministres aussi sont transformés en ministres de justice ; dont la fin sera selon leurs œuvres.  **\n\n2 Thessaloniciens 3 versets 1 à 3   **\n\t«Enfin, frères, priez pour nous, afin que la parole du Seigneur ait libre cours et soit glorifiée, comme elle l'est pour vous \n\tEt que nous soyons délivrés des hommes déraisonnables et méchants ; car tous les hommes n'ont pas la foi.\n\tMais le Seigneur est fidèle, il vous affermira et vous gardera du mal. ”  **\n\nRaison 6, Par ce témoignage personnel, je me présente comme un exemple à imiter pour les autres dans le ministère de la Vérité, de la Droiture et de la Sainteté.  **\n \nPremier Timothée 4 verset 12   **\nQue personne ne méprise ta jeunesse ; mais sois un exemple pour les croyants, en parole, en conversation, en charité, en esprit, en foi, en pureté.  **\n1 Corinthiens 11 verset 1   **\n« Soyez mes disciples, comme moi aussi je suis du Christ.  **\nRaison 7, Le diable désire couvrir la gloire de Dieu de ténèbres afin que les hommes ne voient pas sa présence et ses œuvres actives parmi nous, ses vrais serviteurs. Par ce témoignage personnel, cette obscurité est supprimée afin que les hommes et les femmes du monde entier puissent voir la présence de Dieu et ses œuvres actives dans le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde. En voyant cela, ils peuvent se tourner vers le Seigneur pour leur salut et s'aligner sur l'enseignement du Mouvement qui est basé sur la vérité biblique, la justice et la sainteté, sans lesquelles aucun homme ne verra le Seigneur.  **\nEsaïe 60 verset 1 à 5   **\n« Lève-toi , brille ; car ta lumière est venue, et la gloire de l'Éternel s'est levée sur toi. Car voici, les ténèbres couvriront la terre, et les ténèbres le peuple; mais l'Éternel se lèvera sur toi, et sa gloire sera vue sur toi.\n\tEt les Gentils viendront à ta lumière, et les rois à l'éclat de ton lever.\n\tLève tes yeux tout autour, et vois   tous ils se rassemblent, ils viennent à toi   tes fils viendront de loin, et tes filles seront allaitées à tes côtés.\n\tAlors tu verras, et tu couleras ensemble, et ton cœur sera effrayé et s'élargira ; parce que l'abondance de la mer se convertira à toi, les forces des Gentils viendront à toi ».  **\nRaison 8, La vérité révélée par ce récit personnel, témoigne contre ces mauvais ouvriers qu'ils ont quitté le Seigneur Jésus-Christ et sont employés par le diable pour combattre le Christ et ses enfants, et doivent donc se repentir ou faire face à son jugement éternel.  **\n Deuxième Pierre 2 verset 1 à 3   **\n«Mais il y avait aussi de faux prophètes parmi le peuple, comme il y aura de faux docteurs parmi vous, qui introduiront en secret des hérésies damnables, reniant même le Seigneur qui les a rachetés, et s'attireront une destruction rapide.\nEt beaucoup suivront leurs voies pernicieuses ; à cause de qui on parlera mal de la voie de la vérité.\nEt par convoitise, ils feront de vous, avec des paroles feintes, une marchandise dont le jugement maintenant de longtemps ne s'attarde pas, et dont la damnation ne sommeille pas.  **\n\nRaison 9, Par ce témoignage, vous saurez que rien n'est nouveau sur la terre. La façon dont Jésus et les apôtres ont été défiés et persécutés à l'époque biblique, est la même dont nous sommes persécutés aujourd'hui.\nLa question de la considération n'est pas la persécution mais notre attitude envers elle. Par la grâce de Dieu , nous nous sommes conduits selon les Écritures envers les gens et leurs mauvaises œuvres.  **\nMatthieu 5 verset 10 à 12   **\n\t« Heureux ceux qui sont persécutés à cause de la justice   car le royaume des cieux est à eux.\n\tHeureux serez-vous, lorsqu'on vous outragera, qu'on vous persécutera, et qu'on dira faussement de vous toute sorte de mal, à cause de moi.\n\tRéjouissez-vous et soyez dans l'allégresse, car votre récompense dans les cieux est grande, car c'est ainsi qu'ils ont persécuté les prophètes qui ont été avant vous .  **\n \n2 Timothée 3 verset 12   **\n« Oui, et tous ceux qui vivront pieusement en Jésus-Christ subiront la persécution.  **\n\n\n\nCHAPITRE 5   ** \nMON ADHÉSION ET MON MINISTÈRE DANS L'ÉGLISE BIBLE DE LA VIE PROFONDE   **\nJe suis devenu membre de Deeper Life Bible Church en 1983, quand j'avais vingt et un ans, après avoir terminé mes études secondaires. J'ai retrouvé la foi, étant né de nouveau en 1977. Dans Deeper Life, j'ai beaucoup appris sur Dieu et sa sainteté et j'ai été sanctifié et baptisé du Saint-Esprit. J'étais zélé et dévoué à Dieu et à une vie juste. J'avais faim et soif de Dieu et de sa plénitude et je désirais le servir à plein temps, sauf pour mes études universitaires. Pendant une période de vingt-six ans, j'ai eu la grâce de servir le Seigneur du plus bas au plus haut poste ou rang sous la direction du Surintendant Général ; Pasteur WF Kumuyi .\nJ'ai servi en tant que   chef de maison, chef de zone, pasteur de lieu, coordinateur de district, coordinateur général de campus, surveillant régional (un pasteur responsable des églises Deeper Life dans deux gouvernements locaux ou plus dans un état).\nState Overseer (Pasteur en charge des églises Deeper Life dans un État du Nigeria).\nSurveillant national (pasteur en charge des églises Deeper Life dans un pays en dehors du Nigeria). Mon service ministériel dans Deeper Life a commencé en 1983 jusqu'en 2009.\nLes Écritures suivantes parlent bien de mon service dans Deeper Life Bible Church     **\n1 Corinthiens 4 verset 1 et 2   **\n« Qu'un homme nous considère ainsi comme des ministres du Christ et des dispensateurs des mystères de Dieu.\nDe plus, il est exigé des intendants qu'un homme soit trouvé fidèle.  **\n \n2 Corinthiens 4 verset 1 et 2   **\n\t« C'est pourquoi , puisque nous avons ce ministère, comme nous avons reçu miséricorde, nous ne nous évanouissons pas ;\n\tMais ont renoncé aux choses cachées de la malhonnêteté, ne marchant pas dans la ruse, ni ne manipulant la parole de Dieu de manière trompeuse ; mais par la manifestation de la vérité nous recommandant à la conscience de tout homme devant Dieu »  **\n2 Corinthiens 4 verset 1 et 2   **\n\t« C'est pourquoi , puisque nous avons ce ministère, comme nous avons reçu miséricorde, nous ne nous évanouissons pas ;\n\tMais ont renoncé aux choses cachées de la malhonnêteté, ne marchant pas dans la ruse, ni ne manipulant la parole de Dieu de manière trompeuse ; mais par la manifestation de la vérité nous recommandant à la conscience de tout homme devant Dieu. ”  **\nJ'ai servi comme pasteur dans cinq états différents au Nigeria et dans un autre pays en plus du Nigeria. Au cours de mes vingt-six années de ministère chrétien au sein de la vie profonde, ma conscience me témoigne que j'étais juste et saint à la fois dans la vie et dans le ministère. Je n'ai jamais été trouvé dans le péché, ni en privé ni en secret, Dieu m'en rendant témoignage dans le Saint-Esprit.\nAucun des membres et des ouvriers des églises que j'ai fait paître, homme ou femme, pendant les vingt-six années de Deeper Life, ne peut à juste titre m'accuser de péché contre Dieu, en privé ou en public. J'ai travaillé parmi les pasteurs et les surveillants. Je parle avec la même confiance qu'aucun d'entre eux ne peut dire à juste titre   « Le pasteur Paul Rika n'est pas un ministre de la justice ». C'est le style de vie que j'ai poursuivi jusqu'à ce jour d'écriture, en tant que personne qui a trouvé la faveur d'être le directeur international du Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, après environ neuf ans après avoir quitté Deeper Life Bible Church par la volonté de Dieu.  **\nActes 26 verset 22 et 23   **\n\" Ayant donc obtenu l'aide de Dieu, je continue jusqu'à ce jour, témoignant à la fois aux petits et aux grands, ne disant rien d'autre que ce que les prophètes et Moïse ont dit de venir  \n\tQue Christ devait souffrir, et qu'Il devait être le premier à ressusciter d'entre les morts, et à éclairer le peuple et les Gentils. ”  **\n\n\nMa relation ministérielle avec Michael Thomas Sambo   **\nMichael Sambo est un jeune homme qui a trouvé grâce aux yeux de Dieu pour être utilisé d'une manière particulière en cette fin des temps. Nous sommes tous les deux Kuteb par tribu de l'État de Taraba, au Nigeria. Il est né en 1981 à Bika , dans la région du gouvernement local de Takum , dans l'État de Taraba, soit deux ans avant que je commence le ministère chrétien dans l'église biblique Deeper Life. Il est devenu membre de Deeper Life Bible Church plus tard dans la vie, avec ses parents. En 2003, lors de la retraite des jeunes de l'église biblique Deeper Life, il a reçu la visite du Seigneur Jésus-Christ, qui a emmené son esprit à travers l'expérience de la mort au paradis et en enfer et lui a montré les réalités bibliques. Le Seigneur l'a renvoyé sur la terre avec un message spécial à l'Église et au monde. C'était pendant sa deuxième année à l'université. Bien que nous soyons de la même région et que je connaisse son père, je ne le connaissais pas alors.  **\nAttitude de vie plus profonde envers les révélations divines   **\nL'expérience de la révélation divine de Michael Sambo a été accueillie avec crainte par les dirigeants et les membres de Deeper Life Bible Church, en raison de l'attitude défavorable du surintendant général du ministère, le pasteur WF Kumuyi, envers les rêves, les prophéties et les révélations dans l' église. Lorsqu'un dirigeant a rapporté l'incident de révélation de Michael Sambo et le message perpétré par celui-ci, il a froncé les sourcils et a exigé que les cassettes soient récupérées auprès des membres de l'église et détruites. Par la grâce de Dieu , un ami ministre de Deeper Life m'a donné les cassettes du message de révélation. Quand je les ai écoutés, j'ai vu que le message de la révélation venait de Dieu et était vital pour l'église du Christ et les habitants de la terre. J'ai pris le risque de faire circuler le message de révélation à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur de Deeper Life Bible Church. Plus tard, Dieu m'a conduit à mettre le message de la révélation dans un livre que j'ai intitulé   **\nRÉVÉLATION DIVINE DE LA SAINTETE ET DU JUGEMENT DE DIEU. J'ai contacté certains surveillants sous lesquels Michael Sambo a servi, pour l'emmener au général\nLe surintendant devait être interrogé par lui face à face si cela pouvait aider à le convaincre de la divinité de l'expérience, mais ils s'y sont opposés par crainte de la réaction suspectée qu'ils pourraient recevoir de lui. Lorsque les surveillants concernés s'y sont opposés, j'ai décidé, étant moi-même surveillant, d'emmener Michael Sambo chez le surintendant général, le pasteur WF Kumuyi . J'ai délimité en spirale la copie du message de révélation pour sa lecture. Une copie lui a été donnée par l'intermédiaire de sa femme, et une autre copie a été donnée au secrétaire de l'église. J'ai fait cela parce que, je pensais que par son interaction personnelle avec Michael Sambo et la lecture du message de révélation, il pourrait croire que Dieu y était impliqué et lui permettrait de se répandre librement. Cependant, lorsque nous l'avons rencontré et que j'ai présenté Michael Sambo et la révélation qu'il avait reçue du Seigneur Jésus-Christ, il était sceptique et a dit que lorsque Lazare est ressuscité des morts, il n'est pas venu avec le message de révélation de ce qu'il a vu ou entendu . Cependant, il a dit qu'il lirait le message de révélation que nous lui avions soumis et a dit à Michael Sambo de continuer ses études et de ne pas quitter l'école à cause du message de révélation. Lorsque je revins de mon pays de mission environ un an après, après avoir terminé le livre pour l'impression, je le rencontrai et lui demandai s'il avait lu l'exemplaire que je lui avais donné. A cette époque, il a ouvertement déclaré  «Nous prêchons la Bible et non la rencontre de la révélation. Dites-lui d'arrêter. À ce stade, j'ai cessé de planifier la publication du livre. C'était en janvier 2008.  **\nComment le livre a finalement été publié   **\nAu cours du mois, ma défunte épouse Sis Edna Rika a reçu un diagnostic de cancer et nous avons été dirigés vers l'hôpital universitaire de l'Université d'Ibadan pour le traitement. Nous avons été logés dans l'un des bâtiments de la mission de Deeper Life Bible Church, Ibadan. Au cours de ma prière avec ma défunte épouse, nous avons convenu de donner une somme d'argent à Dieu. Sous la direction de Dieu, cet argent a été utilisé pour faire une photocopie de la révélation du Christ à sept jeunes colombiens et le manuscrit du livre, Révélation divine de la sainteté et du jugement de Dieu, à distribuer gratuitement aux gens. Les témoignages reçus étaient excellents, en particulier sur la révélation divine de la sainteté et du jugement de Dieu. Dieu a commencé à s'occuper de moi pour imprimer le livre. J'ai exprimé ma crainte de le faire à cause de l'opposition des dirigeants de l'église. Mais Il m'a dit d'aller de l'avant, qu'Il serait avec moi. Encouragé, j'ai fait publier le livre. Le livre a fait un excellent travail pour Dieu dans le pays du Nigeria et à l'extérieur. Les yeux de beaucoup ont été ouverts à la vérité biblique, à la justice et à la sainteté requises pour le ciel.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 6   ** \nLE DÉFI QUE J'AI RELEVÉ DANS DEEPER LIFE BIBLE CHURCH   **\nA cette époque, une grande persécution s'éleva contre moi dans l'église biblique Deeper Life. Un comité de quatre surveillants d'état a été mis en place pour m'interroger sur la publication du livre. Quelques jours après, j'ai été amené devant les surveillants étatiques et nationaux du ministère, les principaux pasteurs, pour être interrogé sur la publication du livre. Quand ils m'ont demandé pourquoi j'avais publié le livre, je leur ai dit  «Le Seigneur Jésus est venu à la retraite de Pâques de l'église biblique Deeper Life Takum , État de Taraba, avec deux de ses anges, dans une révélation divine et a emmené Michael Thomas Sambo, dans une expérience de la mort, au ciel et en enfer et lui a donné un message à l'humanité. Mais j'ai remarqué que les membres de la Deeper Life avaient peur de l'entendre à cause de la réaction incertaine du surintendant général. Étant pleinement informé de l'incidence et convaincu de la divinité du message, j'ai contacté certains surveillants pertinents pour emmener Michael Sambo au surintendant général afin que lui aussi puisse entendre et vérifier l'incident. Mais ils avaient peur. En conséquence, j'ai pris sur moi, non pas en tant que surveillant direct de Michael Sambo, mais simplement parce que nous sommes du même endroit, de l'emmener chez le surintendant général. Le surintendant s'est montré sceptique sur la question. Vous êtes tous au courant de la maladie de ma femme et de mon état actuel. Ma femme et moi avons convenu de donner à Dieu une somme d'argent comme semence de foi ; le Seigneur m'a conduit à utiliser l'argent pour faire des photocopies du manuscrit du livre pour une distribution gratuite. Et Il m'a poussé à publier ce livre. Quand je me suis opposé par peur de l'autorité de l'église, il m'a dit d'aller de l'avant en disant qu'il serait avec moi. C'est pourquoi j'ai publié le livre. Le livre fait beaucoup   convertir les âmes, restaurer les rétrogrades et transformer les églises en vérité biblique, droiture et sainteté. Je suis sûr que je m'adressais à plus de quarante surveillants, dont la plupart étaient mes aînés dans la foi et le service chrétien. Ils ont ensuite demandé   « Dieu peut-il vous demander de publier ce livre sans en parler au surintendant général ? J'ai été étonné par cette question. J'ai répondu   '' Nous sommes tous des ministres de Dieu assis ici et avons le Saint-Esprit en nous et la parole de Dieu, la Bible, devant nous. Je veux poser cette question   est-il vrai que Dieu ne peut pas nous utiliser pour faire quelque chose pour lui, à moins qu'il n'en parle d'abord au surintendant général ? À ce moment-là, il y a eu un tollé. Certains me regardaient comme étant têtu, tandis que d'autres le voyaient différemment. Le lendemain, je fus conduit chez le surintendant général qui fit sur moi la déclaration suivante  \n\"Je pensais que lorsque je vous aurais permis de vous tenir devant vos collègues, vous tomberiez, pleurant et implorant grâce, demandant qu'on vous donne l'opportunité de faire le tour des librairies et où que soient les livres pour les rassembler et les brûler. Mais je vois que vous vous tenez toujours sur votre conviction, disant que vous obéiriez à Dieu plutôt qu'à l'homme ? Cette Écriture était utilisée par le Sanhédrin incrédule. Voudriez-vous citer cette Ecriture pour moi à ce sujet? Maintenant, je vous empêche d'être un surveillant, un prédicateur, un leader et un travailleur dans Deeper Life. Quant à savoir si vous reviendrez jamais… cela dépend de ce que vous avez fait sur ce livre et vous êtes discipliné. Votre salaire est désormais arrêté »\nJ'ai quitté son bureau confus quant à la suite. J'étais très triste et j'avais peur de quitter Deeper Life Bible Church. Mais le Seigneur m'a dit  La vie éternelle n'est pas Kumuyi ou Deeper Life, mais moi-même. Avant la fondation de Kumuyi ou de Deeper Life, les gens allaient au paradis. Le problème est d'être là où Je veux que vous soyez et de faire Ma volonté, c'est la vie éternelle. Cela m'a beaucoup réconforté.  **\n\nJ'ai perdu ma première femme   **\nMa femme malade est décédée plus tard, en avril de cette année-là, 2009, et sur instruction du surintendant général, les surveillants des États du nord-est du Nigéria devraient prendre en charge l'enterrement, qui a eu lieu dans mon village, SabongidaLissam, gouvernement local d' Ussa , État de Taraba. Je suis retourné voir le surintendant général pour montrer mon appréciation pour la gentillesse que j'ai reçue pour l'enterrement de ma femme et j'ai signalé que cela avait été fait avec succès. Après cela, je suis retourné à Ibadan et suis resté dans le logement dans les locaux de l'église ; J'ai rencontré le surveillant responsable et lui ai demandé de m'aider à dire au surintendant général que puisque je n'ai reçu aucune instruction de sa part, je suis retourné à Ibadan pour rester dans les locaux de l'église. Il m'a dit plus tard qu'il a contacté le surintendant général qui a dit   « Dites au pasteur Paul Rika de faire le tour et de rassembler les livres de partout où ils se trouvent, comme je le lui ai dit. Ne pas le faire montre qu'il n'est pas sous mon autorité. Quand on m'a dit cela, au début, cela ne m'a pas dérangé . Mais après avoir parfois commencé à raisonner en moi, \"n'est-il pas risqué pour mon âme éternelle d'être en lice avec un homme oint de Dieu en la personne de WF Kumuyi ?\" J'ai donc décidé d'arrêter la publication du livre. J'ai rédigé une lettre qui devait être envoyée à l'éditeur lui ordonnant d'arrêter la publication du livre. C'était mon plan qu'après avoir envoyé la lettre à l'éditeur, j'irais avec une copie pour montrer au surintendant général la mesure que j'avais prise concernant le livre. Mais après avoir rédigé la lettre, je me suis assis pour lire l'Ecriture. Le Seigneur m'a donné   **\nActes 19 verset 36   **\n\"Voyant donc qu'on ne peut s'opposer à ces choses, vous devez vous taire et ne rien faire avec imprudence.\"\nIl m'a dit de ne jamais me retirer de la publication du livre. Il a dit   « Le pasteur WF Kumuyi ou Deeper Life Bible Church ne pourra jamais prouver par les Écritures que ce message de révélation ne vient pas de moi. Restez silencieux et attendez la prochaine action. Je connaissais la voix du Seigneur et je m'y soumettais.  **\n\nMa Lettre de Retrait de Service   **\nLe Seigneur a parlé à plusieurs reprises et de différentes manières pour me fortifier dans cette affaire. Environ trois mois après que le Seigneur m'a parlé dans une révélation disant Qu'attendez-vous à Deeper Life Bible Church? Pensez-vous que l'autorité de Deeper Life viendra plus tard pour accepter ce livre de révélation ? Ou envisagez-vous de soumettre le livre pour qu'il soit brûlé comme on vous l'a demandé ? Levez-vous et quittez la Deeper Life Bible Church   le monde vous attend.\nÉtant éclairé et renforcé par ces mots, j'ai mis ma lettre de retrait du service à temps plein avec Deeper Life Bible Church, en juillet 2009, avec un préavis d'un mois. Dans la lettre, j'ai déclaré que mon service avec Deeper Life serait considéré comme terminé après le préavis d'un mois . J'ai écrit cette lettre avec appréhension, me demandant si j'étais toujours considéré comme un ministre de Deeper Life ou si j'avais été renvoyé par le prononcé du surintendant général. Ma lettre n'a pas reçu de réponse comme je l'envisageais. Après l' expiration du préavis d'un mois , j'ai commencé à exercer mon ministère dans le cadre du Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, qui s'est poursuivi jusqu'à aujourd'hui.  **\n\nAnnulation de la Discipline de l'Église   **\nEn octobre 2010, le surintendant général, le pasteur WF Kumuyi , a annoncé via les médias publics que tous ceux qu'il avait mis sous surveillance avaient été libérés et que ceux qui avaient quitté Deeper Life Church pouvaient revenir, s'ils le voulaient, et que ceux qui voulaient continuer dans leur ministère devraient le faire, mais devraient se voir libérés de toute discipline qui leur était imposée par le surintendant général. C'est un cas bien connu des membres de Deeper Life Bible Church que la discipline de l'église infligée à un membre peut ne pas être vraiment que le membre a péché contre Dieu. La transgression contre la règle confessionnelle peut conduire à la discipline et pourtant peut ne pas être un péché contre Dieu. La discipline de l'église qui m'a été imposée n'était pas parce que j'avais péché contre Dieu, mais contre la tradition confessionnelle qui n'a aucune base biblique. C'est devenu un moyen par lequel Dieu m'a retiré de l'église biblique Deeper Life pour commencer un nouveau travail pour lui dans le mouvement mondial de réveil de la sainteté, selon son plan des temps de la fin. L'action du pasteur Kumuyi est restée une pierre d'achoppement pour de nombreux membres de Deeper Life aujourd'hui qui se sont délibérément exclus de l'œuvre de la grâce de Dieu par la révélation divine et le ministère que j'ai reçu de lui. Ce problème est au-delà de mes capacités à gérer, Dieu s'en occupera lui-même.  **\n\n  Ce que Jésus a dit à Michael Thomas Sambo   **\nDe la narration ci-dessus, vous avez compris comment j'ai rencontré Michael Thomas Sambo et comment j'ai travaillé sur lui dans le Seigneur. Lors de sa troisième visite au ciel, Jésus lui a dit qu'il allait le diriger vers un homme qui le dirigerait et répandrait son message de révélation jusqu'aux extrémités de la terre. Le Seigneur lui a dit que cet homme est le pasteur Paul Rika. Le Seigneur lui a donné la vision du Mouvement non confessionnel, le Mouvement mondial de réveil de la sainteté et lui a montré le chef du Mouvement, le directeur international, le pasteur Paul Rika. Selon Michael Thomas Sambo, alors qu'il me l'a raconté, il a demandé au Seigneur   \"Tu m'as montré que le pasteur Paul Rika est le chef du Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, qu'as-tu pour moi ?\" Le Seigneur lui répondit   « Je t'ai amené à un mentor, suis-le. Vous n'avez pas le ministère mais il a le ministère. Vous avez le message de révélation. Vous utiliserez la plate-forme de son ministère pour diffuser le message de la révélation.\nDepuis le début du Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide 55 en août 2009, Michael Sambo exerçait son ministère dans le cadre de ce mouvement. Nous sommes allés ensemble dans de nombreux endroits où il a reçu des invitations pour partager son témoignage. Il est pour moi un fils dans le Seigneur et je suis un père dans le Seigneur pour celui qui a exercé le ministère deux ans après sa naissance. J'ai appliqué la grâce et la sagesse de Dieu en moi pour le diriger sur la façon de partager sa révélation. La plupart des invitations reçues par Michael Sambo sont venues à la suite de la lecture du livre que j'ai écrit concernant son expérience de révélation divine intitulée   RÉVÉLATION DIVINE DE LA SAINTETE ET DU JUGEMENT DE DIEU   Un récit de trois visites surnaturelles au paradis et en enfer. J'ai été humble face à Michael Sambo et patient avec ses fautes.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 7   ** \nMA CONVICTION DOCTRINAL PARTIE 1   **\nJ'ai prêché la saine doctrine et donné des interprétations bibliques aux écritures, selon ma formation et l'inspiration du Saint-Esprit.  **\nPremier Timothée 4 versets 15 et 16   **\n« Méditez sur ces choses ; donne-toi entièrement à eux; que ton profit puisse apparaître à tous.\n\tPrends garde à toi-même et à la doctrine ; continue en eux, car en faisant cela, tu te sauveras et tu sauveras ceux qui t'écoutent. ”  **\n2 Timothée 2 verset 2   **\n \"Et les choses que tu as entendues de moi parmi de nombreux témoins, les mêmes te confient à des hommes fidèles, qui pourront aussi enseigner aux autres.\"  **\n\nTite 2 verset 1,7 et 8   **\n« Mais dis les choses qui conviennent à la saine doctrine  \nEn toutes choses, montre-toi un modèle de bonnes œuvres; dans la doctrine montrant l'intégrité, la gravité, la sincérité,\nDiscours sain, qui ne peut être condamné; afin que celui qui est du côté contraire ait honte, n'ayant rien à dire de mal de vous.  **\n\nVoici mes convictions doctrinales et ce que je prêche selon la Sainte Écriture   **\n1) \tLa Sainte Bible   **\nLa Sainte Bible est la parole de Dieu, inspirée pour l'humanité, avec autorité finale sur toutes les questions de la vie   personnelle, familiale, gouvernementale et sociale.  **\n2) \tLa Trinité   **\nDieu existe en trois personnes distinctes   le Père, le Fils (Jésus-Christ) et le Saint-Esprit. Ces trois personnes distinctes existent ensemble de toute éternité en tant qu'un seul Dieu, qui est le Créateur, le Seigneur, Jéhovah, l'Éternel, le Dieu tout-puissant Premier Jean 5 verset 7 ; Matthieu 28 verset 19 ; Marc 12 verset 29. Dieu a fait de l'homme une personne tripartite ; Corps, Âme et Esprit, selon Sa ressemblance. L'homme est trois personnes distinctes en une et une personne sur trois à l'image du Dieu éternel, Genèse 1 verset 26 et 27.  **\n3) \tL'Humanité de Jésus\nJésus est Dieu qui s'est fait homme et est né enfant d'une femme, vierge, qui n'avait jamais couché avec un homme depuis sa naissance. Luc 1 verset 30 à 35, Matthieu 1 verset 21 à 23 Esaïe 9 verset 6, Philippiens 2 verset 5 à 7.  **\n4) \tJésus Seul Sauveur de l'Humanité   **\nJésus est venu dans ce monde en tant que Fils de Dieu dans le but de sauver l'humanité du péché, de Satan, de la mort éternelle et de tous les maux, et de leur accorder la vie éternelle et les bénédictions divines, selon les Écritures. Ceux-ci ont été atteints par ses souffrances, sa mort et sa résurrection d'entre les morts, Jean 3 verset 14 à 16, Luc 2 verset 10 à 12, Hébreux 2 verset 9 à 15, Romains 8 verset 32. Il est le seul Sauveur de l'humanité dans l'ensemble. monde. Aucun homme, aucun prophète ou religion ne peut sauver l'homme du péché, de Satan et de la mort éternelle dans ce monde, sauf Jésus-Christ. Actes 4 verset 12 ; Jean 14 verset 6 ; Jean 8 verset 12 ; 10 verset 10.  **\n5) \tLe péché de tous les hommes   **\nChaque homme qui est né dans ce monde a été conçu dans le péché et né dans le péché. Premièrement, parce qu'il est un descendant d'Adam et qu'il a hérité du sang souillé par son péché originel. Deuxièmement, parce qu'il entre dans une pratique pécheresse personnelle depuis son enfance, Psaume 51 verset 5; Romains 3 verset 23.  **\n6) \tSalut du péché   **\nLe salut du péché est l'expérience surnaturelle accomplie chez un pécheur qui a cru en Jésus et a accepté de suivre Jésus de tout son cœur. Par cette expérience, le Saint-Esprit, au moyen de la parole de Dieu et du sang du Christ, accomplit des merveilles dans son cœur et dans sa vie, le transformant du péché à la justice, des ténèbres à la lumière et de la puissance de Satan à Dieu. Ce vrai\nl'expérience est aussi appelée, ( i ) Nouvelle créature, 2 Corinthiens 5 verset 17.  **\n(ii) \tLe pardon des péchés, Tite 3 verset 5.  **\n(iii) \tRégénération, Tite 3 verset 5.  **\n(iv) \tRéconciliation avec Dieu, Colossiens 1 verset 21 et 22.  **\n(v) \tRédemption, Galates 4 versets 4 et 5.  **\n(Vi) Adoption, Romains 8 verset 15   **\nLe salut du péché est un don de grâce en Christ pour tous ceux qui se repentent sincèrement de leurs péchés et acceptent le Seigneur Jésus-Christ dans leur vie, Actes 20 verset 20.  **\n7) Baptême \td'Eau   **\nLe baptême d'eau est un rite qu'il est ordonné d'accomplir sur tous ceux qui se sont repentis et ont cru au Seigneur Jésus-Christ. Cela doit être fait sans délai, Marc 16 versets 15 et 16 ; Actes 8 versets 36 à 38. Ceux qui se sont convertis à Christ et qui ont tout le privilège d'être baptisés dans l'eau, mais qui y jouent avec insouciance sont dans la désobéissance et le péché. Les ministres de l'évangile doivent être prompts à baptiser leurs convertis dans l'eau. Le baptême d'eau n'est pas pour les pécheurs ou les nourrissons, mais pour ceux qui ont entendu l'évangile et se sont repentis de leurs péchés et ont répondu à la foi au Seigneur Jésus, Actes 2 versets 37 et 39. Le baptême d'eau biblique est une émersion dans le corps de de l'eau au nom de Dieu le Père, le Fils et le Saint-Esprit. C'est la formule du baptême réalisée par les Apôtres dans Actes des Apôtres. L'expression Baptême au nom de JÉSUS signifie le baptême tel qu'autorisé, instruit ou commandé par Jésus pour le différencier du baptême de Jean et de celui que les pharisiens faisaient sur leurs convertis, Actes 19 verset 3 à 5 ; Matthieu 23 verset 15.  **\n8) Expérience de Sanctification   **\nLa sanctification est un mot biblique qui a deux significations dans la Bible. Le premier sens est la séparation, la consécration, mis à part à Dieu pour un usage sacré. À cet égard, des personnes, des choses et des lieux peuvent être sanctifiés ou mis à part pour Dieu. À cet égard, Jésus a été sanctifié par Dieu le Père pour le salut de l'homme et Jésus s'est sanctifié pour la sainteté des croyants , Jean 17 verset 19. \nLe deuxième sens biblique du mot sanctification révèle la sanctification comme une deuxième expérience chrétienne définie requise chez un croyant . cœur par lequel le Saint-Esprit, au moyen de la parole de Christ et de Son sang, rend le croyant purifié du péché héréditaire, du péché originel, du péché inné qui pèse souvent sur le cœur d'un croyant. Cela se manifeste dans la pollution pécheresse de l'orgueil, de l'envie, de la cupidité, de la méchanceté, de la colère et ainsi de suite. L'expérience de la sanctification est requise pour éliminer cela du cœur et de la vie du croyant afin de le rendre libre et de lui donner la capacité gracieuse de manifester une vie sainte croissante. En termes simples, l'expérience du salut fait à un pécheur ce que l'eau et le détergent font à un vêtement sale. L'expérience de la sanctification fait à un croyant ce que le rinçage fait sur un vêtement lavé . Les deux sont des expériences distinctes, mais nécessaires pour un nettoyage sain. Alors que le pécheur exerce sa foi et prie Jésus-Christ pour son salut du péché, les croyants \nviennent à Christ dans la foi et prient pour recevoir la sanctification et la pureté du cœur et de la vie, Jean 17 versets 14 à 20 ; Ephésiens 5 versets 24 à 27 ; Actes 26 à 18. Sanctification signifie aussi pureté, sainteté et circoncision du cœur.  **\n9) Baptême du Saint-Esprit   **\nLe baptême du Saint-Esprit est la transmission de la puissance du Saint-Esprit dans la mesure baptismale à un croyant en Christ. Cette expérience confère au croyant le pouvoir d'un service chrétien efficace. Parler en langues par le croyant est une preuve incontestable que l'on a été baptisé du Saint-Esprit. Les dons du Saint-Esprit sont valables jusqu'à aujourd'hui. Celles-ci sont précisées dans Luc 24 versets 48 et 49 ; Actes 1 verset 4,5 et 8; 1 Corinthiens 12 versets 7 à 11. Cependant, le baptême du Saint-Esprit n'est pas une condition pour le ciel. Ce qui se qualifie pour le ciel, c'est la sainteté.  **\n10) Guérison, Délivrance, Prospérité et Miracles   **\nLa parole de Dieu est la parole de guérison, de délivrance et de miracles Psaumes 107 verset 20 Le nom de Jésus guérit les malades et délivre les opprimés des mauvais esprits. Il est commandé aux croyants d'utiliser le nom de Jésus dans la prière pour la guérison, la délivrance, la prospérité et les miracles pour eux-mêmes et pour les autres dans le besoin, Marc 16 versets 17 et 18. La guérison, la délivrance et les miracles sont valables aujourd'hui, car Jésus est vivant dans l'Église et dans le monde Hébreux 13 verset 8. Nous recevons la guérison par la foi et la prière selon la parole de promesse de Dieu. La guérison et les miracles font partie des dons du Saint-Esprit donnés à certains croyants dans l'église pour bénir le peuple de Dieu, premier Corinthiens 12 verset 7 à 10.  **\nUtilisation des Médicaments   **\nL'utilisation de médicaments et de médecins, qu'ils soient conventionnels ou à base de plantes, n'est pas contraire à la parole de Dieu. Ce qui est mal, c'est consulter des esprits familiers pour la protection, la guérison et la délivrance. Lorsque des médicaments curatifs sont utilisés dans la foi, la justice et les prières à Dieu, les malades peuvent être guéris, des conditions anormales peuvent devenir normales, Luc 5 verset 31 Ézéchiel 47 verset 12.  **\nGuérison et miracles par des substances physiques   **\nDans les Écritures, Dieu a accompli des miracles uniques d'une manière particulière. Quelques-uns d'entre eux incluent le prophète Élie qui a séparé le fleuve Jourdain et l'a traversé et Élisée a fait de même peu de temps après. Jésus a transformé l'eau en vin. L'ombre de Pierre a guéri les malades. Des mouchoirs et des tabliers empruntés à l'apôtre Paul guérissaient les malades et chassaient les démons. Ces sortes de les miracles n'étaient pas monnaie courante parmi le peuple. Donc ils ne sont pas pratiqués à plusieurs reprises parmi le peuple de Dieu. Dieu ne le permet pas ainsi. Il y a des miracles communs que nous pouvons rechercher pour nous-mêmes et pour les autres et pour la gloire de Dieu en utilisant la parole de Dieu, le nom de Jésus et les dons du Saint-Esprit. L'utilisation courante des mouchoirs, des tabliers, du sable, du sel, de l'eau ou de ce qu'on appelle aujourd'hui des \"manteaux\" pour les miracles dans l'église n'est pas du Saint-Esprit. Il est introduit par l'ennemi de la croix pour détourner la foi des hommes de Jésus vers les substances. C'est de la sorcellerie dans l'église, Galates 3 verset 1. En détournant la foi des croyants vers ces manteaux, ils sont amenés à servir des idoles. La pratique aujourd'hui par de nombreux prédicateurs qui transforme la foi des gens en mouchoirs, tabliers, sel, sable, eau et autres substances pour la guérison et les miracles est condamnée comme sorcellerie sur les gens dont la foi en Jésus-Christ est subvertie à leur perte, Galates 3 verset 1.\nUne étude des Écritures montre que les miracles par l'utilisation de ceux-ci sont très rares et ne sont pas des normes pour les prédicateurs à pratiquer et à élever la foi des gens pour chercher à les faire répéter dans leur vie. La foi en Jésus seul est la norme. L'utilisation de l'huile d'onction était strictement réservée aux malades et n'est pas obligatoire. De nombreuses personnes à l'époque apostolique ont été guéries sans l' utilisation d' huile d'onction. L'utilisation de l'huile d'onction n'était pas si répandue à l'époque du Nouveau Testament. Par conséquent, il n'y a pas de place dans le Nouveau Testament pour oindre des ministres ou des membres d'église, des locaux commerciaux, des bâtiments d'église et des équipements avec de l'huile, Galates 1 verset 6 à 8.\nC'est la volonté de Dieu que les croyants prospèrent matériellement comme ils prospèrent en santé, Troisième Jean verset 2; Job 36 verset 11   **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 8   ** \nMA CONVICTION DOCTRINAL PARTIE 2  *\n11) \tMariage   **\nLe mariage est une institution établie par Dieu lui-même. L'Écriture décrit le mariage comme une union entre un homme et une femme qui ont été unis l'un à l'autre, ayant obtenu le consentement parental de la femme et réglé les demandes parentales requises, Marc 10 versets 6 à 9. Dieu s'intéresse au mariage de Ses enfants et ordonne croyants en Christ de ne jamais épouser des non-croyants, Deutéronome 7 versets 3 et 4; 2 Corinthiens 6 verset 14.\nLa cérémonie de mariage peut être conduite selon les exigences du mariage des croyants, mais ce n'est pas ce qui détermine le mariage. La cérémonie de mariage des croyants doit être exempte de toute impiété, mondanité et péché dans l'habillement et les activités cérémonielles. Le test de mariage doit être fait pour éviter le transfert de maladies mortelles. Le mariage biblique est une union entre un homme (qui ne s'est jamais marié auparavant ou dont la femme est décédée) et une femme (qui ne s'est jamais mariée auparavant ou dont le mari est décédé), Luc 16 18. La monogamie est la norme. La polygamie est scripturairement condamnée. L'adultère ne peut pas causer le divorce et le remariage, mais la fornication, Matthieu 19 verset 9; Jean 8 versets 3 à 5 et 7. Un homme qui est dans une union conjugale avec la femme de quelqu'un commet la fornication. Le repentir exigera la séparation ou le divorce d'avec elle. Il est libre d'épouser une autre femme. La même chose s'applique à une femme qui est mariée au mari d'une autre femme.  **\n12)\t Restitution   **\nLa restitution est la pratique scripturaire consistant à corriger ses mauvaises actions passées contre Dieu et l'homme, selon de nombreux exemples scripturaires. Cette pratique est requise pour libérer le croyant de l'accusation des hommes et de la conscience personnelle afin qu'il puisse servir Dieu dans la paix et la confiance,   **\nEcclésiaste 3 verset 15   **\n« Ce qui a été est maintenant ; et ce qui doit être a déjà été ; et Dieu exige ce qui est passé.  **\nPremier Samuel 12 verset 2 à 4   **\n« \tEt maintenant, voici, le roi marche devant vous ; et je suis vieux et grisonnant ; et voici, mes fils sont avec toi, et j'ai marché devant toi depuis mon enfance jusqu'à ce jour.\n\tVoici, je suis ici   témoin contre moi devant l'Éternel et devant son oint   de qui ai-je pris le bœuf ? ou à qui ai-je pris le cul? ou qui ai-je fraudé? qui ai-je opprimé ? ou de la main de qui ai-je reçu un pot-de-vin pour m'aveugler les yeux ? et je te le rendrai.\n\tEt ils dirent   Tu ne nous as pas escroqués, tu ne nous as pas opprimés, et tu n'as rien pris de la main de personne.  **\nActes 24 verset 16   **\n\"Et c'est en cela que je m'exerce à avoir toujours une conscience sans offense envers Dieu et envers les hommes.\"\nLa restitution consiste à avouer un crime caché, à mentir, à trahir autrui et à présenter des excuses. Le croyant doit pardonner aux autres et demander pardon à ceux qu'il a offensés. La restitution implique de restituer de l'argent, des certificats, des documents ou des biens volés ou frauduleux, de faire des aveux à la personne appropriée et de s'excuser pour les actes répréhensibles, avec la volonté de supporter le coût ou la peine d'un tel crime. Les maris et les femmes doivent faire une confession d'infidélité conjugale et de péché commis l'un contre l'autre en public ou en secret, Jacques 5 verset 16.\nLa restitution est requise dans le mauvais mariage. Un mariage bibliquement erroné doit être dissous ; comme le deuxième ou le troisième mariage, le mariage avec une personne autre que votre premier partenaire légitime, Genèse 20 versets 3 et 7. Le mariage sans consentement parental et la libération de leur fille à son mari doivent être dissous ou le couple doit faire tout ce qui est nécessaire pour le mariage être acceptable devant Dieu en s'arrangeant avec les parents de la femme. C'est ce qu'on appelle la restitution.\nLa restitution consiste à réparer le mal que vous avez fait et c'est un commandement du Seigneur auquel il faut obéir. Ne pas le faire est un péché et aucun pécheur n'héritera de la vie éternelle, Ézéchiel 33 verset 14 à 16. Nous comprenons dans l'Écriture que le consentement parental est requis pour que la femme parte pour le mariage, 1 Corinthiens 7 verset 38. L'Écriture ne précise pas que le consentement du parent de l'homme est requis pour rendre authentique son mariage avec sa femme. Par conséquent, aucun homme ne devrait se séparer de sa femme scripturairement contraignante à cause de l'attitude de ses parents. Cependant ses parents peuvent le conseiller sur ses affaires conjugales qu'il peut accepter ou rejeter, Genèse 28 verset 1 à 9.  **\n13) L'évangélisation et la grande mission   ** \nIl est demandé à tous les croyants de s'engager dans l'évangélisation et le gain d'âmes. Le Seigneur s'attend à ce que tous ses enfants soient fructueux, non seulement dans le fruit chrétien de la justice et de la sainteté, mais aussi dans le fruit de l'évangélisation et du gain d'âmes, Marc 16 versets 15 à 18 ; Jean 15 versets 8 et 16. Les croyants doivent se prévaloir de fournir les ressources nécessaires pour gagner des âmes efficacement, parrainer des prédicateurs, produire du matériel pour gagner des âmes, prier avec ferveur pour le salut des pécheurs et la préservation des saints.\nLes composantes de la grande commission sont l'évangélisation, la vérité et la sainteté, Matthieu 28 versets 19 et 20. En plus de faire des disciples pour Jésus-Christ, nous devons nous assurer que les croyants apprennent la vérité inscrite dans les Écritures. C'est la connaissance de la vérité biblique qui produit la justice et la vraie sainteté requises pour le ciel, Jean 8 versets 30 à 32 ; Colossiens 1 verset 28 et 29. La connaissance de la vérité libère des ruses sataniques et les pleines bénédictions du christianisme, 2 Corinthiens 2 verset 11 ; Romains 8 verset 32.  **\n14) \tMinistère de la femme.  **\nGenèse 1 verset 27 et 28   **\nDieu a créé l'homme et la femme comme des êtres complémentaires et leur a donné le droit de se multiplier et de régner sur la terre. L'homme a été créé en premier, puis la femme. Les deux ont été créés dans le même but. Quoi que l'homme soit chargé de faire, la femme devait l'aider à le faire. Elle doit le faire avec l'homme, Genèse 2 verset 18. Nous voyons la femme travailler avec l'homme dans la vie de famille, la vie sociétale et l'administration et dans le ministère chrétien, 1 Corinthiens 11 verset 11,12; 9 verset 5; Actes 18 versets 24 à 26.  **\nLes Écritures nous ont donné des exemples de femmes dans l'Ancien Testament qui ont été utilisées par Dieu pour administrer la parole et la doctrine aux hommes et aux femmes, en privé et en public. Tels comprennent     **\nI)\tMariam; Exode 15 verset 20 et 21 ; Nombres 12 versets 1 et 2 ; Michée 6 verset 4   **\nII)\tII) \tDéborah ; Juges 4 verset 1 à 9   **\nIII)\tHulda ; Deuxième Chroniques 34 versets 20 à 28.  **\nLes femmes sont des disciples de Jésus et la grande commission les implique aussi, Matthieu 28 verset 18 à 20 ; Marc 16 versets 15 à 18. Lorsque Jésus est ressuscité des morts, il a chargé Marie-Madeleine de transmettre le message de la résurrection à ses disciples, Jean 20 versets 11 à 17. Philippe l'évangéliste avait quatre filles qui ont prophétisé à l'église, Actes 21 versets 8 et 9 . Les femmes ont la liberté de prophétiser dans l'église, 1 Corinthiens 11 versets 4 à 6. Prophétiser, c'est parler aux hommes pour l'édification, l'exhortation et la consolation, Actes 14 verset 3. Les femmes peuvent enseigner dans l'église, Matthieu 28 versets 18 à 20 ; Actes 18 versets 24 à 26 ; Tite 2 verset 3 à 5. La Bible est contre les femmes qui sont indisciplinées, désobéissantes, usurpant l'autorité sur les hommes. Cela devrait être mis sous contrôle, pour apprendre en silence, et non pour enseigner 1 Corinthiens 40 versets 33 à 35 ; 1 Timothée 1 verset 9 à 11. Les femmes chrétiennes qui servent le Seigneur dans la justice et la sainteté doivent se prévaloir devant le Saint-Esprit pour les utiliser de la manière qu'Il veut, Matthieu 9 36-38.\n Par conséquent, les saintes femmes peuvent prêcher, enseigner, chanter, prier, prophétiser, conduire, pasteur selon l'appel et la grâce de Dieu.  **\n15) \tSainte Communion   **\nLa sainte communion, également appelée le repas du Seigneur, est un rite que Jésus a institué pour que ses disciples soient observés souvent en souvenir de sa mort sacrificielle pour eux , jusqu'à ce qu'il revienne pour enlever les saints, Luc 22 verset 19 et 20. Le fait que ce rite a été effectué le soir ne signifie pas qu'il doit être pris uniquement le soir. Ce qui est significatif ici, c'est le souvenir qu'il communique à l'Église concernant la mort sacrificielle de Jésus chaque fois qu'il est pris. La révélation ultérieure du Seigneur à l'apôtre Paul confirme l'observance de ce rite dans l'Église, I Corinthiens 11 versets 23 à 30.  **\nprésentation de Paul   **\nun. \tLe pain représentait le corps   **\nb. \tLe vin (non alcoolisé) représentait le sang.  **\nc. \tLa prise de ces deux objets est en souvenir de la mort de Jésus jusqu'à son retour.  **\nd. \tCe rite doit être observé souvent par l'Église.  **\ne. \tLes participants doivent s'assurer qu'il n'y a pas de péché non confessé et non repenti dans leur vie. Par conséquent, l'auto-examen est nécessaire .  **\nF. Il est dangereux pour les pécheurs de participer à ce rite dans leurs péchés et leur méchanceté   **\ng. Le jugement suit ceux qui s'obstinent à prendre ces substances dans le péché.  **\n16) \tDîmes Et Offrandes   **\nLe paiement des dîmes au Seigneur est un commandement du Seigneur à l'humanité. La dîme représente un dixième de tous les revenus gagnés, qu'il s'agisse d'argent, de cultures vivrières, d'animaux élevés, de gains, d'intérêts ou de dividendes dans les affaires. Le paiement de la dîme avait été les observances des hommes pieux dès l'Ancien Testament, Genèse 14 verset 18 à 20 ; Genèse 28 verset 22. Des commandements supplémentaires ont été ajoutés sur le paiement de la dîme pendant la loi de Moïse, tels que la dîme des dîmes, l'offrande des prémices et autres. Tous ces additifs qui ont pris naissance dans la loi de Moïse dans le désert ont été abolis en Christ, Romains 10 versets 3 et 4. Cependant, le paiement de la dîme comme c'était avant la loi de Moïse continue dans le Nouveau Testament parce que Jésus notre Souverain Sacrificateur, après le ordre de Milchizédek , demeure éternellement. Comme Abraham et ses fils (alors dans ses entrailles payaient la dîme à Milchisédech , ainsi aussi les enfants d'Abraham par la foi, qui sont des croyants en Christ, devraient payer la dîme à Jésus-Christ notre actuel Souverain Sacrificateur, qui vit pour toujours, Hébreux 7 verset 14,8 -10,15 à 17; Galates 3 verset 7. Ne pas payer la dîme, c'est être maudit par Dieu d'être un voleur et un brigand de Dieu. Ce ministre doit encourir la colère de Dieu. C'est comme parrainer les ennemis de Dieu contre Lui , Matthieu 7 verset 6 ; 2 Jean 1 verset 7 à 11. L'offrande est celle que l'on donne à Dieu après déduction de la dîme et le montant est déterminé par l'individu, Malachie 3 verset 8 à 12   **\n17) \tHabillage chrétien et parure    **\nIl y a l'habillement et la parure selon Dieu et il y a l'habillement et la parure impies. Les croyants sont avertis et sommés d'éviter les vêtements et les parures impies. L'utilisation de pantalons/pantalons/pantalons par les femmes ou de toute robe uniquement masculine par les femmes est condamnée et l'utilisation de toute robe et parure uniquement féminines par les hommes est également condamnée.\nDeutéronome 22 verset 5. Les robes exposant les parties sensibles du corps, favorisant ainsi l'excitation sexuelle sont mauvaises et coupables, Matthieu 5 versets 27 et 28 ; 1 Corinthiens 8 versets 9 et 12.  **\nLes robes des croyants doivent bien les couvrir en position assise et doivent bien les couvrir en position debout elles ne doivent pas être serrées sur leur corps. Les attaches capillaires, les permanentes, le bouclage Jerri des cheveux, l'utilisation de la laine, le tissage et la teinture des cheveux sont des ornements maléfiques. Le blanchiment de la peau, la peinture corporelle, l'utilisation de poudre, de rouge à lèvres et de cortex sont mauvais. Les croyants doivent être simples, propres et naturels dans leur parure. L'utilisation de boucles d'oreilles, bagues, bracelets, perles, alliances, chaînes, colliers (bijoux) est condamnée par les Écritures comme une parure impie, Premier Pierre 3 verset 3 à 5. Voir à travers les robes et les vêtements avec des bijoux ou des pierres brillantes dessus doit être évité , Exode 33 verset 4 à 6. Les femmes doivent éviter les fils à la mode dans la coiffure. Le tissage ou le tressage des cheveux doit être exempt de styles mondains.  **\n18) \tL'Enlèvement   **\nJésus a laissé la terre au ciel avec la promesse qu'il reviendrait pour prendre les croyants de la terre pour être avec lui, Jean 14 verset 1 à 3. L'Église attend la venue de Jésus pour la prendre de la terre au ciel. Cet événement est appelé l'Enlèvement, l'enlèvement des saints de la terre en un instant, 1 Thessaloniciens 4 versets 13 à 18. Nous sommes au temps de la fin et dans la période de l'enlèvement. Les croyants doivent toujours être dans la droiture et la sainteté en préparation de cet événement unique et universel qui aura lieu à tout moment, Premier Jean 3 versets 2 et 3. Cet événement implique Jésus-Christ, accompagné d'anges célestes et de saints descendant du ciel sur la terre. Les saints se rendront sur la terre pour leur résurrection corporelle. Les vrais et saints croyants qui sont vivants sur terre pendant cette période seront soudainement changés et leur corps sera transformé en un corps glorieux. Les morts en Christ ressusciteront premièrement et les saints vivants sur la terre seront enlevés avec eux pour rencontrer le Seigneur dans les airs, qui ira avec eux au ciel pour le souper de noces de l'Agneau et la récompense ou le Jugement des saints. Apocalypse 19 verset 5 à 9 ; 22 versets 12 à 14.  **\n19) \tLes Résurrections   **\nIl existe deux types de résurrections. Celles-ci sont appelées la première résurrection et la seconde résurrection, Apocalypse 20 verset 6. Elles sont aussi appelées la résurrection pour la vie et la résurrection pour la damnation, Jean 5 verset 28 ; Daniel 12 verset 2. La résurrection de Jésus-Christ a commencé la première résurrection. Cependant, la première résurrection des croyants en Christ commencera à l'enlèvement, la résurrection des saints de l'âge de l'Église et se terminera avec la résurrection des saints de l'Ancien Testament et des saints de la tribulation, peu de temps avant la seconde venue de Christ pour le règne millénaire, après que le Seigneur ait fini Son travail sur Israël à la fin de la soixante-dixième semaine a prophétisé sur eux, Daniel 9 24. Tous ceux qui participeront à la première résurrection vivront et régneront avec Christ pour toujours et à jamais dans son royaume éternel de justice, de paix et de joie.\nLa deuxième résurrection est la résurrection de damnation qui aura lieu après le règne millénaire, après la dernière bataille avec Satan appelée la bataille de Gog et Magog. Tout ce qui a vécu et est mort dans le péché depuis le début de l'existence de l'homme sur terre jusqu'à cette période dans le temps sera ressuscité pour le jugement divin et la condamnation finale à l'étang de feu éternel, avec Satan et les démons, les angles tombés, Apocalypse 20 verset 10, Matthieu 25 verset 41.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 9   ** \nMA CONVICTION DOCTRINAL PARTIE 3   **\n20) \tLa grande tribulation\nImmédiatement après l'enlèvement des saints, il y aura une période de tribulation de sept ans. Ce sera la période de règne pratique de Satan par l'Antéchrist, l'homme du péché, 1 Thessaloniciens 2 versets 8 à 10.\nAvant que le destin ne tombe sur l'humanité par le jugement de l'eau, les quelques justes, Noé et sa famille ont été sauvés au moyen de l'arche. Avant que Sodome et Gomorrhe ne soient détruites par le jugement du feu, les quelques justes ont été enlevés, Lot et sa famille. Avant que la grande Tribulation ne vienne sur le monde de l'incrédulité et de la méchanceté, les quelques justes et saints sur terre seront enlevés au moyen de l'Enlèvement. Les périodes de Tribulation de sept ans sont divisées en deux périodes de trois ans et demi. La première période de trois ans et demi est une période où l'Antéchrist émergera, offrira une solution aux crises mondiales et à la confusion et établira son règne. C'est une période de fausse paix et de prospérité par l'Antéchrist. Sachez également que la période de la grande tribulation est une période de jugement divin sur les peuples du monde pour avoir rejeté leur Créateur et Sauveur . Ce jugement divin s'étendra sur la période de tribulation, du début à la fin. La méchanceté des impies sur la tribulation sera grande. L'évangile du salut de Dieu en Christ sera prêché pour amener les êtres humains à se soumettre au salut de Dieu en Christ et pour les dissuader de se soumettre à l'Antéchrist en recueillant sa marque; 666   Apocalypse 14 versets 6, 7, 9 à 12.\nPar conséquent, les gens croiront toujours en Christ et seront sauvés pendant la période de la Grande Tribulation. Les trois dernières années et demie verront une plus grande intensité de la manifestation de l'Antéchrist. À ce moment- là , Il affrontera les Juifs plus intensément. Il prétendra être Dieu et s'assiéra dans le temple en tant que Dieu et exigera leur adoration. En cas de refus des Juifs, il y aura une Grande Guerre contre eux pour les anéantir de l'existence. Cette guerre s'appelle la bataille d'Armageddon. 2 Thessaloniciens 2 versets 4 et 5 ; Matthieu 24 verset 15, 21, 22 ; Apocalypse 16 verset 14 à 16.\nLes enfants d'Israël pendant cette période crieront à Dieu pour leur Messie et se repentiront de leur folie en rejetant Jésus lors de sa première venue. Le Seigneur combattra l'Antéchrist et ses soldats et les détruira. L'Antéchrist et son faux prophète seront jetés vivants dans l'étang de feu, Apocalypse 19 verset 19 à 21.  **\n\n21) \tLa seconde venue de Jésus-Christ   **\nLa première venue de Jésus a été prophétisée dans l'Écriture Ésaïe 7 verset 14; 9 verset 6 et 7. Cela a été accompli dans le Nouveau Testament, Matthieu 1 verset 21 à 23. Il est venu comme le Sauveur de l'homme pour donner la vie éternelle à ceux qui croient en lui, Jean 3 verset 14 à 16. Il a été méprisé et rejeté des hommes. Il a été crucifié et tué par des hommes. Il est mort et a été enterré. Le troisième jour, il est ressuscité des morts et est monté au ciel, pour revenir sur terre pour juger ceux qui se sont rebellés contre lui, qui l'ont renié, Actes 1 verset 9 à 11. Sa première venue a été silencieuse et inopinée. Mais Sa seconde venue sera avec une grande gloire. Tous les yeux Le verront. Matthieu 24 verset 30. Il viendra avec ses saints pour régner sur la terre pendant mille ans.  **\n22) Règne \tmillénaire du Christ   **\nApocalypse 20 verset 1 à 6   **\nLorsque Christ reviendra sur la terre lors de sa seconde venue, Satan sera lié et jeté dans l'abîme. La terre sera débarrassée de ses démons. Tous ceux qui ont reçu la marque de la bête seront détruits. Les occupants de la terre seront composés de ceux qui n'ont pas reçu la marque de la bête 666, Christ établira son règne sur la terre pendant mille ans. Ses saints de l'Ancien et du Nouveau Testament régneront avec Lui. Ceux qui sont vivants sur terre à Sa venue et qui n'ont pas le corps ressuscité vivront la vie naturelle normale sur terre. Ceux-ci doivent encore se marier, produire et remplir la terre. La terre retrouvera son ordre originel, sa fécondité, sa beauté et sa perfection. Christ gouvernera le monde avec son siège à Jérusalem. Il y aura la paix, la justice, la prospérité et la joie sur terre. La terre sera remplie de la connaissance de Dieu comme les eaux recouvrent la mer. Esaïe2 verset 2 à 4, 11verset 6 à 10 ; Ésaïe 35 verset 110. Puisque les hommes naturels seront sur terre pendant le règne millénaire, ceux qui ne donnent pas consciemment leur vie à Christ resteront des pécheurs. Mais le péché sera supprimé et grandement minimisé.\nAprès la fin des mille ans, le diable sera délié de l'abîme pour un temps donné sur les hommes naturels qui peuplent la terre pour voir ceux qui ont accepté ou renié le Seigneur, ayant vu sa gloire, ses œuvres et son pouvoir sur l'humanité et nature. Hélas, beaucoup se soumettront encore à la tromperie de Satan contre le Seigneur Jésus et ses saints. Satan les rassemblera contre l'Éternel à la bataille de Gog et Magog, le nombre de son armée sera comme le sable du bord de la mer. Ceux-ci seront détruits et Satan sera jeté dans l'étang de feu et de soufre pour être tourmenté pour toujours et à jamais , Apocalypse 20 verset 1 à 10. Cela montre que le problème d'un pécheur n'est pas seulement Satan mais sa nature innée qui doit être apporté à Christ pour son salut. Montrer de l'amour et de la faveur peut ne pas aboutir à sa justice. Il doit exercer une foi pratique en Christ pour son salut et sa purification complète, Psaumes 51 verset 110, Esaïe 26 verset 10.  **\n23) \tLe Jugement du Grand Trône Blanc   **\nApocalypse 20 versets 11 à 15, Matthieu 25 versets 41 à 44 ; Marc 9 verset 43 à 48. Cela se produira après le règne millénaire et la dernière rébellion des hommes sur terre après la guerre. Tous les morts depuis le commencement de la terre jusqu'à la dernière rébellion après le règne millénaire ressusciteront. Cette résurrection est appelée la deuxième résurrection. Tous ceux qui ressusciteront à ce moment seront damnés à jamais par Dieu. Avant cette condamnation, ils seront jugés par le Seigneur Jésus-Christ afin que chacun sache pourquoi il est condamné par le Dieu de vérité et de justice. Par conséquent, ils seront jugés selon leurs œuvres. Après cela, ils seront jetés dans l'étang de feu. La damnation et les tourments du lac de feu sont connus comme la seconde mort. Le feu de l'enfer actuel qui est sous la terre abrite temporairement les âmes des pécheurs morts. Lorsque les pécheurs reviendront de l'enfer sur la terre pour le jugement du grand trône blanc et seront jetés dans l'étang de feu, le feu de l'enfer sera également jeté dans l'étang de feu. La mort aussi sera jetée dans l'étang de feu. Satan, les démons et les pécheurs seront tourmentés pour toujours et à jamais. Cela mettra fin à toutes les rébellions des créatures de Dieu.  **\n24) \tFeu de l'enfer, Lac de feu,  **\nLuc 16 verset 19 à 31 ; Esaïe 5 verset 13 à 14 ; Apocalypse 20 versets 11 à 15 L'enfer est un lieu de tourments et de souffrances indicibles, où les pécheurs morts vont depuis le commencement de la terre, jusqu'au jugement final de Dieu sur eux, après le règne millénaire de Jésus. La Bible révèle individuellement que le feu de l'enfer est sous la terre, Nombres 16 versets 30 à 34. C'est un lieu de flammes de feu et de vers tourmentants. Satan et ses démons ne passent pas maintenant par le jugement en enfer parce que leur temps n'est pas encore venu, Matthieu 8 versets 28 à 29.\nCependant, Satan et ses démons sont actuellement la main-d'œuvre ou le pouvoir ou les portes de l'enfer. Ils sont les bourreaux de tous les hommes condamnés au feu de l'enfer. La Bible révèle que le feu de l'enfer est maintenant sous la terre comme demeure temporaire des âmes des pécheurs. Après le jugement final, les pécheurs et le feu de l'enfer lui-même seront jetés dans l'étang de feu. C'est là que Satan et ses démons aussi seront jetés pour des tourments appropriés et éternels. Ce sera la fin finale de Satan rebelle, de ses anges et de l'humanité.\nDans l'histoire racontée par Jésus, l'homme riche pouvait voir Lazare au paradis qui était sous la terre. Ils étaient séparés par un grand gouffre fixé par Dieu, qui était recouvert d'eau. C'est dans ce paradis que Jésus et le brigand converti sur la croix sont descendus après la mort.\nC'était ici que tous les justes de toutes les générations attendaient l'expiation finale par le Christ par son sang. La Bible montre que le paradis a été enlevé de dessous la terre au ciel après la résurrection du Christ, de sorte que les morts en Christ vont maintenant directement au ciel où se trouve le Christ, Luc 16 versets 23 à 26 ; 23 versets 40 à 43 ; Ephésiens 4 versets 8 à 10 ; Philippiens 1 verset 21 à 24.  **\n\n25) \tLe nouveau ciel et la nouvelle terre   **\nAprès le jugement final des hommes rebelles et la condamnation de Satan et de ses partisans à l'étang de feu, le Seigneur Jésus livrera le royaume à son Père afin que Dieu soit tout en tous, 1 Corinthiens 15 versets 24 à 28 \"Ciel\" tel qu'utilisé dans l'Écriture fait référence à la fois à l'espace atmosphérique des nuages, de la lune, du soleil, des étoiles et des galaxies et à la place du trône de Dieu, que l'apôtre Paul a appelé le troisième ciel, 2 Corinthiens 12 verset 15. C'est là que les saints de l'Ancien Testament avait cherché passionnément avec tout l'engagement et la consécration à entrer, Hébreux 11 versets 13 à 16. Jésus a appelé cet endroit \"la maison de mon Père\", c'est sa promesse actuelle pour tous les croyants fidèles et saints, Jean 14 versets 1 à 3. Cependant, les Écritures nous révèlent que l'état final de la vie éternelle avec Dieu est plus étendu que le ciel actuel où Dieu et ses anges habitent. Il y aura une récréation, un grand travail de rénovation sur la terre et le ciel atmosphérique qui fera apparaître l'excellence créatrice, Esaïe 65 versets 17 à 19 ; Deuxième Pierre 3 verset 13 à 14.  **\nLe siège de l'état éternel sera la Nouvelle Jérusalem qui est créée par Dieu et préservée pure et sainte dans le ciel pendant cette période. Il descendra du ciel dans l'atmosphère au-dessus de la terre recréée ou renouvelée et servira de demeure à Dieu. Les saints habiteront avec Dieu dans la perfection et connaîtront l'amour parfait, la paix, la joie, la satisfaction, les plaisirs, la puissance et le confort. Il n'y aura plus de douleur, de chagrin ou de mort, Apocalypse 21 verset 1 à 5.  **\n26) \tProphéties et expériences de révélation   **\nDaniel 2 verset 19 à 22 ; Ephésiens 3 verset 1 à 3, Apocalypse 1 verset 1 à 3\nDieu révèle des choses secrètes et cachées. Il a révélé des choses à Joseph, Daniel, Paul, Jean et d'autres. Jésus a promis que le Saint-Esprit révélera des choses à ses disciples, Jean 16 verset 13 à 16. Certaines révélations sont personnelles et si elles édifient les autres, elles doivent être attestées, Marc 13 verset 37. Par le don de prophétie, les secrets des hommes sont révélés, 1 Corinthiens 14 versets 24 et 25. La prophétie ne doit pas être méprisée. C'est Dieu qui parle dans les prophéties, 1 Thessaloniciens 5 verset 20. Dieu peut transporter l'esprit d'un homme quelque part pour voir et entendre ses œuvres et ses plans et retourner dans le corps et témoigner aux autres, Ézéchiel 40 versets 1 à 4. Dieu peut emmener les gens en enfer pour en voir l' horreur et revenir pour témoigner aux autres, pour leur servir d'avertissement contre le péché et Satan, Esaïe 66 verset 24.\nDieu peut emmener une personne au ciel pour voir la béatitude de l'éternité selon son dessein désiré, comme il l'a fait avec l'apôtre Paul. La forme que cela prendra est la prérogative de Dieu, Premier Corinthiens 12 versets 1 à 5. Les prophéties et les révélations de Dieu comme dans l'Écriture sont valides aujourd'hui, Hébreux 13 verset 8. Par conséquent, les révélations et visions prophétiques actuelles données par Dieu aux individus choisis sont Scripturaire et devrait être accepté, 1 Thessaloniciens 5 versets 19 à 21. Ce que l'Écriture met en garde, c'est de tester l'esprit et de s'assurer que le message donné n'est pas contraire à l'Écriture, Galates 1 verset 6 à 9 ; Premier Jean 4 versets 1 et 2. Beaucoup ont trébuché sur les expériences de révélation à cause de ce qu'Abraham a dit à l'homme riche en enfer, Luc 16 versets 27 à 31. Le dialogue était entre l'homme riche et Abraham et non entre lui et Dieu. Ni Abraham ni les Angles ne savent quelle stratégie Dieu a à la fin des temps, dans sa sagesse, en tant que maître vainqueur d'âmes, Proverbes 11 verset 13. Les prophéties et révélations authentiques font beaucoup aujourd'hui, comme aux jours de la Bible pour sauver les pécheurs et édifier les saints, 1 Corinthiens 14 verset 3. Guidé par le Saint-Esprit, le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté accepte les prophéties, les révélations et les visions de Dieu et leur donne l'occasion de les partager pour l'édification des saints et le salut des pécheurs. Celui qui me voit comme un faux prophète, un faux prédicateur, un faux enseignant ou un faux ministre se fait du mal ainsi qu'à ceux qui le croient et tous deux feront face à la colère de Dieu. Ceux qui choisissent de m'accuser, allez-y. Jésus aurait-il pu se soucier de ceux qui l'appelaient Belzébuth ? Il avait plus de travail à faire. Il m'a dit, constamment, \"mon fils, ces choses sont des distractions, elles détournent ton attention, avance et prêche l'évangile sans t'en soucier.\"  **\n27) \tJour de culte acceptable    **\nJésus nous a montré la nature de Dieu et comment L'adorer de manière acceptable   **\nJean 4 verset 22 à 24   **\n\t« Vous adorez, vous ne savez pas quoi ; nous savons ce que nous adorons ; car le salut vient des Juifs.\n\tMais l'heure vient, et elle est déjà venue, où les vrais adorateurs adoreront le Père en esprit et en vérité, car le Père cherche de tels adorateurs.\n\tDieu est Esprit   et ceux qui l'adorent doivent l'adorer en esprit et en vérité. ”  **\n\nLa qualité de vie requise pour plaire à Dieu est la justice et la sainteté. Premier Pierre 1 verset 14 à 16. La sainteté est l'obéissance et la conformité aux Écritures dans la norme morale. La véritable adoration de Dieu ne met pas l'accent sur un lieu, un jour et une heure, Jean 4 verset 21. Dieu a sanctifié le septième jour et s'y est reposé, mais n'a pas dit à Adam ou aux saints de l'Ancien Testament de l'adorer ce jour-là . La justice d'Enoch, Noé, Abraham et d'autres saints de l'Ancien Testament, avant la loi, était complète et digne du ciel sans l'observance du jour du sabbat. C'était la justice de la foi, Romains 4 verset 3. Les croyants d'aujourd'hui sont après la foi d'Abraham qui sont justifiés par la foi en Christ, sans observer le jour du sabbat donné dans la loi, Galates 3 verset 6 à 9. L'observance de le sabbat n'est pas une loi morale mais un cérémonial. Toutes ces lois données à Moïse ont été abolies en Christ, Romains 10 verset 4. Continuer à observer le jour du sabbat parce qu'il a été commandé dans la loi de Moïse, montre l'ignorance des observateurs de la justice par la grâce en Christ. Ces observateurs sont contraints par les Écritures d'obéir à toutes les autres exigences de la loi de Moïse pour vivre. Ce qu'ils ne peuvent certainement pas faire, Romain 10 verset 5; Galates 3 versets 10 à 14.  **\n\nObservance dominicale   **\nL'observance du dimanche aujourd'hui, en tant que jour d'adoration pour les chrétiens, n'est pas un commandement de l'Écriture, mais une tradition transmise par les apôtres et les croyants de l'Église primitive. Puisque Jésus est ressuscité des morts le premier jour de la semaine, c'est-à-dire le dimanche, on l'appelait le jour du Seigneur . Le jour chrétien solennel de repos et d'adoration est passé du jour du sabbat dans la loi au dimanche, Luc 24 versets 1 à 6; Apocalypse 1 à 10 ; Actes 20 verset 7.  **\n\nDifférents jours de culte aujourd'hui   **\nAujourd'hui, nous voyons que différents jours sont adoptés par divers organismes et sociétés chrétiennes comme jour à observer pour le repos et le culte. Ceux-ci incluent le dimanche, le samedi et le vendredi. Les membres des communautés musulmanes considèrent le vendredi comme un jour libre pour se consacrer au repos et au culte. Quel que soit le jour choisi avec des raisons satisfaisantes et consacré pour le repos et l'adoration, il est acceptable par Dieu, tant que l'adoration est dans la vérité, la justice et la sainteté. Mais adorer le samedi parce que c'est le jour du sabbat et parce que cela a été commandé dans la loi de Moïse, c'est faire preuve d'ignorance spirituelle et de ténèbres envers la véritable adoration de Dieu. Certains sont simplement trompés par des démons dans cette pratique, Romains 14 versets 4 à 6 ; Colossiens 2 verset 16 à 22.  **\n\n\n\nCHAPITRE 10   ** \nMON RÔLE DE LEADERSHIP DANS HOREMOW   **\nMon administration sur le Holiness Revival Movement est dans la justice et la sainteté, Premier Samuel 12 versets 3 à 5  \nVoici, me voici   témoin contre moi devant le Seigneur et devant son oint   de qui ai-je pris le bœuf ? Ou à qui ai -je pris le cul ? Ou qui ai-je fraudé ? Qui ai-je opprimé ? Ou de la main de qui ai-je reçu un pot-de-vin pour aveugler mes yeux ? Et je te le rendrai. Et ils dirent   tu ne nous as pas escroqués, tu ne nous as pas opprimés, tu n'as rien pris de la main de personne. Et il leur dit  L'Éternel est témoin contre vous, et son oint est témoin aujourd'hui, que vous n'avez rien trouvé entre mes mains. Et ils répondirent   Il est témoin.\n\nJ'ai travaillé avec des dirigeants toutes ces années dans ce mouvement de la sainteté avec une conscience pure. Je n'ai opprimé aucun des coordinateurs. Je n'ai trompé aucun d'entre eux. Je n'ai planifié le mal contre aucun d'eux. Celui qui a été retiré du poste de coordinateur se connaissait lui-même. Aucun d'entre eux ne viendra pointer un doigt accusateur contre moi. Je fais de mon mieux par la prière pour suivre la volonté de Dieu sur chacun d'eux. Je traite les membres du Mouvement de la même manière depuis le début du Ministère jusqu'à aujourd'hui. L'Éternel m'aidera; Je vivrai ainsi jusqu'au bout. Amen.\nLes gens ont dit à Samuel qu'ils avaient vu sa vie juste et sainte et qu'ils étaient des témoins.\nJe dis cela parce qu'il y a un adage qui dit \"personne n'est complètement juste\". La mentalité de beaucoup est que la sainteté de vie n'est pas possible. Dieu m'a dit   « Mon fils, les gens ne croient pas que tu es saint ; c'est parce qu'ils ne croient pas à la possibilité de la sainteté. Maintenant l'Ecriture dit, Jésus est mort pour l'église afin de nous rendre sanctifiés et saints. Si quelqu'un disait que la sainteté de vie n'est pas une possibilité, il sous-estime le sacrifice de Christ. Pour l'impur, tout est impur. Si vous êtes impur et impie, vous penserez que tout le monde est impur et impie. Un adultère pensera que tous les hommes commettent l'adultère. La Parole de Dieu est vraie. La Parole de Dieu a le pouvoir de vous sauver et de vous soutenir dans le salut. Le sang de Jésus a le pouvoir de vous purifier et de vous soutenir dans la sainteté. Changez votre mentalité. Ce que Satan veut dire au monde, c'est que même l'homme (c'est moi) qu'ils appellent saint homme de Dieu n'est pas vraiment saint. C'est ce que Satan veut dire pour que vous soyez découragés. Il veut accuser les saints enfants de Dieu afin de décourager les gens de croire qu'ils peuvent être saints. Afin que les gens croient et recherchent la sainteté de vie et de ministère, Dieu m'a poussé à écrire ce récit personnel sincère de ma vie et de mon ministère.\nL'administration du mouvement de réveil de la sainteté par moi est dans la droiture et la sainteté. En tant que dirigeant juste, je dirige dans la crainte de Dieu, ne craignant personne et ne respectant personne afin de plaire à Dieu et d'établir la vraie justice et la sainteté de ceux à qui je prêche.  **\nSeconde Chroniques 19 verset 5 à 10.  **\n« Et il établit des juges dans le pays dans toutes les villes fortifiées de Juda, ville par ville,\nEt il dit aux juges   Prenez garde à ce que vous faites, car vous ne jugez pas pour un homme, mais pour l'Éternel, qui est avec vous pour le jugement.\nC'est pourquoi maintenant que la crainte de l'Éternel soit sur vous; prenez garde et faites-le; car il n'y a pas d'iniquité avec l'Éternel, notre Dieu, ni d'égards pour les personnes, ni d'acceptation de dons.\nEt Josaphat plaça à Jérusalem des Lévites, des sacrificateurs et des chefs des pères d'Israël, pour le jugement de l'Éternel et pour les querelles, lorsqu'ils retournèrent à Jérusalem.\nEt il leur ordonna, disant   Vous ferez ainsi\ndans la crainte de l'Éternel, fidèlement et d'un coeur parfait.\nEt quelle cause viendra à vous de vos frères qui habitent dans leurs villes, entre le sang et le sang, entre la loi et le commandement, les statuts et les jugements, vous les avertirez même qu'ils ne transgressent pas l'Éternel, et ainsi la colère viendra sur vous , et sur vos frères   faites ceci , et vous ne transgresserez pas.  **\nJe m'assure que mon jugement vient d'un cœur parfait, mon administration vient d'un cœur parfait, mon enseignement, ma surveillance et mes conseils ne contiendront aucune erreur. Je fais toujours attention à chaque conseil que je donne parce qu'il y a Dieu qui m'écoute et je lui rendrai compte. C'est un travail délicat, c'est pourquoi la Bible dit   ne soyez pas nombreux, car nous qui enseignons recevront la plus grande condamnation. Je fais ces choses sans respect des personnes. Je traite chaque personne selon les spécifications des Écritures. Personne n'est plus grand que l'Écriture. Je dois faire à tout le monde ce que Dieu me commande, si je désire la vie éternelle et la récompense de sa part.  **\n\nMon mentorat   **\nEn 2010, Dieu m'a conduit à démarrer une réunion de chapitre ou une fraternité non confessionnelle où des personnes de différentes églises peuvent se rassembler et apprendre la parole de Dieu sur la vérité, la justice et la sainteté.\nPar la grâce de Dieu, j'ai écrit de nombreux autres livres, dont certains sont des livres de révélation comme celui de Michael Sambo. Le Seigneur qui m'a amené Michael Sambo pour mes soins et mon mentorat dans le ministère a également amené de nombreux autres frères qui ont reçu des révélations similaires pour moi pour le mentorat. J'en suis venu à découvrir que cela faisait partie de ma vocation d'encadrer ces personnes et de coordonner le message de révélation pour une présentation correcte et compréhensible à l'église et au monde. Au cours du ministère avec Michael Thomas Sambo, fin 2011, j'ai compris qu'il souhaitait être indépendant de moi. En 2012, peu de temps avant son mariage, il a demandé qu'il souhaite rester seul dans l'État de Taraba après son mariage. Pendant tout ce temps, il était resté avec moi à Abuja et j'avais pensé à trouver un logement dans le même voisinage pour lui et sa femme. J'ai succombé à sa demande. J'ai demandé si je pouvais lui donner une allocation mensuelle pour son entretien à Jalingo . Il s'y est opposé, disant que le Seigneur lui avait ordonné de ne pas être sous salaire. Je l'aimais et prenais soin de lui et de sa famille en m'assurant qu'ils n'étaient pas dans le besoin. Je n'ai cessé de le corriger et de le réprimander avec amour pour ses erreurs spirituelles.  **\nLe Retrait de Michael Thomas du Mouvement de Réveil de la Sainteté   **\nMes relations avec Michael Thomas Sambo en tant que ministre sous moi aux yeux de Dieu et à la lumière des Écritures étaient dépourvues d'envie, d'orgueil, de haine, d'égoïsme, d'oppression ou de quoi que ce soit de ce genre. Je me suis assuré d'être en relation avec lui dans la vérité, la droiture et la sainteté, avec une conscience pure. Mais je remarquais continuellement des impuretés \ndans sa vie. J'ai demandé diligemment à Dieu ce que je devais faire à ce sujet, surtout après une faute grave. Le Seigneur m'a dit qu'il ne vivait pas la vie de sainteté qu'il prêche dans le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde entier et m'a ordonné de le placer sur la discipline pour l'inconduite grossière qu'il a manifestée pour le réveiller à la vie juste et sainte requise de lui. Cette instruction a été reçue en septembre 2015. Lorsque j'ai reçu cette instruction de Dieu, à partir d'une prière prolongée sur Michael Thomas Sambo, j'ai réuni des dirigeants clés et certaines personnes sélectionnées au sein du Mouvement pour lui servir de témoins et de conseillers le jour où la discipline serait prononcé sur lui. Cela a été fait au cours du mois de septembre 2015. Pas comme nous l'espérions, la discipline a mis fin au service de Michael Thomas Sambo avec Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide. Il a quitté le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté et a ouvert son propre ministère par lequel il exerce maintenant un ministère. Tous mes efforts et ceux des autres membres du Holiness Revival Movement pour le récupérer ont échoué.\nBien que j'entende beaucoup d'histoires, d'accusations et de chantage contre moi à son sujet, je ne suis pas troublé mais paisible car je sais que je ne lui ai pas fait de mal, et que Dieu ne m'accuse pas non plus de péché à cause de lui. Ma conscience me rend témoignage dans le Saint-Esprit. Beaucoup ont été amenés à trébucher devant le Seigneur par ses actions et ses récits. Tout ce que j'ai dit ici à son sujet n'est pas dans l'intention de ternir son image ou son ministère ; car il a encore l'occasion de s'amender et d'être pardonné par Dieu et par les hommes. Mais je me sens obligé de les dire si je peux par quelque moyen que ce soit sauver certains qui ont été mal informés, induits en erreur et ont rétrogradé du Seigneur à cause de cette affaire.  **\nDiscipline pour l'errant   **\nTous ceux qui servent le Seigneur en tant que ministres et dirigeants sous moi doivent vivre de cette manière afin de maintenir la sainteté et la justice dans ce précieux mouvement de réveil de la sainteté de la fin des temps, Philippiens 3 versets 12 à 15 ; 4 versets 8 et 9. Ceux parmi les dirigeants sous moi qui ont rétrogradé par rapport à la vraie foi de Christ et ne vivent pas dans la droiture et la sainteté, ne tenant plus à la vérité des Écritures, sont enlevés et remplacés. Ceci est fait par l'œuvre de Dieu. Il connaît les gens et les traitera selon sa grâce, sa sagesse et son jugement.\nAllons-nous employer des prédicateurs qui viendront et détruiront à nouveau cette œuvre sainte ? Non. \"Son évêché en a laissé un autre prendre.\" C'est ce que nous faisons selon la parole de Dieu, Tite 1 verset 5 à 11 ; 2 Timothée 3 versets 16 et 17, mais je dois déclarer ici que la patience, l'amour, l'avertissement et les bonnes actions sont appliqués sur les égarés, 2 Timothée 3 versets 16 à 17 Toute Écriture est inspirée de Dieu et est profitable pour la doctrine , pour la réprimande, pour la correction, pour l'instruction dans la justice, afin que l'homme de Dieu soit parfait, entièrement pourvu à toutes les bonnes œuvres.\nLes Écritures sont utilisées pour corriger, reprendre et réprimander. L'Écriture doit être signalée à celui qui s'égare pour qu'il corrige sa voie.  **\n\nHébreux 12 verset 5 à 11   ** \n« Et vous avez oublié l'exhortation qui vous est adressée comme à des enfants, mon fils, ne méprise pas le châtiment de l'Éternel, et ne faiblis pas quand on te réprimande. Pour qui le Seigneur aime, il châtie et flagelle tout fils qu'il reçoit . Si vous endurez le châtiment, Dieu vous traite comme des fils   car quel est le fils de celui que le père ne châtie pas ? Mais si vous êtes sans châtiment, auquel tous participent, alors vous êtes des bâtards et non des fils. De plus, nous avons eu des pères de notre chair qui nous ont corrigés, et nous leur avons donné du respect   ne devrions-nous pas plutôt être soumis au Père des esprits, et vivre ? Car en vérité, pendant quelques jours, ils nous ont châtiés selon leur propre plaisir ; mais Lui pour notre profit, afin que nous participions à Sa sainteté ». Or, aucun châtiment pour le présent ne semble être joyeux, mais douloureux   néanmoins , par la suite, il produit le fruit paisible de la justice pour ceux qui s'en exercent. ”  **\nIl faut absolument discipliner les errants. Nous devons retirer les gens du service lorsqu'ils ne sont pas performants. Nous devons réprimander et corriger les gens. Un père fait cela à ses enfants. Un maître fait de même avec ses serviteurs. Si je suis un père dans le Mouvement de Réveil de la Sainteté, si je suis un maître pour les gens qui servent sous moi, ne puis-je donc pas les corriger ? Ne puis-je pas froncer les sourcils et désapprouver un personnage impie ? Ceci est fait pour leur perfection et leur sainteté afin qu'ils puissent hériter de la vie éternelle, mais beaucoup refusent la correction d'un père aimant et s'empressent de me maltraiter et de me maudire dans les rues, sur Internet, à la radio et sur Facebook. Ils disent toutes sortes de choses. Eh bien, le Seigneur a dit   « Laisse-les-moi et va de l'avant. Je les laisse à Dieu et j'avance.  **\n\nFaites votre choix sur ce qu'il faut entendre   **\nJe ne perdrai pas mon temps à leur répondre, non, je prêcherai mon message. Ceux qui ont des oreilles pour entendre entendront, mais ceux qui estiment qu'ils doivent être écoutés peuvent aller les rejoindre. L'alcool est là pour ceux qui sont prêts à périr. Mais le bon vin est là pour ceux qui sont prêts à se réjouir. Le bon vin est la bonne parole de Dieu.\nLes accusations et les critiques des pécheurs sont l'alcool. Voulez-vous de l'alcool? Allez boire et être ivre et soyez prêt à périr. Mais voulez-vous vous réjouir en Christ ? Venez pour le bon vin, buvez, soyez joyeux en Christ et allez au Ciel.\nJe prêche la lumière, je ne prêche pas les ténèbres. Amen. Si vous voulez périr, écoutez mes adversaires. Si vous voulez avoir la vie éternelle, écoutez ce que je prêche. Parce que je ne fais pas les choses que je fais par moi-même, le Seigneur a témoigné que c'est par sa grâce que je vis et que je fais ce que je fais. Il a parlé de moi de différentes manières. Les témoignages ont été si nombreux ; vous en avez peut-être entendu beaucoup. Michael Thomas Sambo a dit que le Seigneur lui avait dit au Ciel dans son expérience de révélation divine   « J'ai suscité un homme qui propagera ce message. Je vous envoie vers lui, c'est le pasteur Paul Rika. Bien sûr, le Seigneur m'a suscité pour ce travail. Dans une figure, je suis mort dans l'église biblique Deeper Life afin que je puisse ressusciter avec un nouveau peuple et susciter un nouveau mouvement de sainteté afin que les hommes et les femmes puissent expérimenter cette sainteté qui a été mise dans un coin dans la chrétienté. Aujourd'hui, le monde entier brille et se réjouit de nation en nation, de ville en ville, de race en race ! Pourquoi? Quelqu'un a risqué sa vie, risqué son ministère pour mener cette bataille contre l'homme et Satan. Satan a fait de son mieux mais cela n'a pas fonctionné. Il a fait tout ce qui était en son pouvoir, mais le pouvoir de Satan a échoué.  **\nSœur Linda   **\nSœur Linda est également venue après sa rencontre avec la révélation divine en disant que le Seigneur Jésus lui a dit   « J'ai suscité un Mouvement sur la terre et c'est Mon Mouvement   J'ai mis Mon fils dessus, qui enseigne Ma vraie parole . Allez les rejoindre. Si vous obéissez à tout ce que mon fils y enseigne, vous serez qualifié pour l'héritage céleste. Vous y arriverez sûrement quand je viendrai.\nDieu veut que vous soyez aussi dans le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté. Vous trouverez un lieu de sécurité pour votre vie spirituelle. Vous trouverez le ministère en Christ. Vous y trouverez sainteté et utilité. J'espère que c'est ce que le Seigneur vous dit aussi. Dieu a donné à Sœur Linda une place dans ce Mouvement, comme vous pouvez le voir. Elle le fait bien. Amen. Le Seigneur lui accordera la vie éternelle. Elle n'est pas la seule à avoir témoigné de Dieu concernant le pasteur Paul Rika et le Holiness Revival Movement. Plusieurs personnes ont été utilisées par Dieu pour témoigner de sa grâce sur moi et sur le Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide.  **\nCHAPITRE 11   **\nMESSAGE DE JÉSUS À L'ÉGLISE MÉTHODE DANS L'ÉCRITURE MYSTÈRE - INTERPRÉTÉE LE MERCREDI 24 MAI 2017   **\nMoi, le pasteur Paul Rika, je suis revenu au Nigéria après mon voyage au Canada et aux États-Unis et mes frères m'ont dit qu'un membre de l'Église méthodiste, sœur Bester S. Michael, avait rencontré le Seigneur Jésus à travers une expérience de mort imminente au cours de leur réunion régionale des femmes. Conférence tenue à l'Église Méthodiste Unie, Masaka , État de Nassarawa , du 11 au 14 mai 2017. Sœur Bester a été complètement restaurée et est venue avec de nombreux messages du Seigneur aux individus et à l'Église méthodiste. Elle a demandé un carnet de notes et y a écrit des écritures illisibles, inconnues et illisibles. Selon elle, le Seigneur Jésus lui a dit lors de la rencontre que personne au monde ne pouvait lire l'écriture, à l'exception du pasteur Paul Rika. Une incidence similaire est apparue dans le récit biblique de Daniel.  **\nDaniel 5 verset 5 à 13.  **\n« A la même heure sortirent les doigts d'une main d'homme, et écrivirent contre le chandelier sur le plâtre du mur du palais du roi ; et le roi vit la partie de la main qui écrivait.\nAlors le visage du roi changea, et ses pensées le troublèrent, de sorte que les jointures de ses reins se délièrent, et ses genoux se frappèrent l'un contre l'autre. 7 Le roi cria à haute voix de faire venir les astrologues, les Chaldéens et les devins. Et le roi prit la parole et dit aux sages de Babylone   Quiconque lira cette écriture et m'en montrera l'interprétation sera vêtu d'écarlate et aura une chaîne d'or autour de son cou, et sera le troisième souverain de le Royaume.\nAlors entrèrent tous les sages du roi, mais ils ne purent lire l'écriture, ni en faire connaître au roi l'interprétation.\nAlors le roi Belshazzar fut très troublé, et son visage changea en lui, et ses seigneurs furent étonnés.\nOr la reine, en raison des paroles du roi et de ses seigneurs, entra dans la salle de banquet. Et la reine prit la parole et dit   Ô roi, vis à jamais ; que tes pensées ne te troublent pas, et que ton visage ne change pas.\nIl y a un homme dans ton royaume, en qui est l'esprit des dieux saints ; et aux jours de ton père, la lumière, l'intelligence et la sagesse, comme la sagesse des dieux, se trouvèrent en lui ; que le roi\nNebucadnetsar, ton père, le roi, dis-je, ton père, a établi le maître des magiciens, des astrologues, des Chaldéens et des devins;\nPuisqu'un excellent esprit, et la connaissance, et la compréhension, l'interprétation des rêves, et l'affichage des phrases dures, et la dissolution des doutes, ont été trouvés dans le même Daniel, que le roi a nommé Belteshatsar   maintenant que Daniel soit appelé, et il montrera L'interprétation.\nAlors Daniel fut amené devant le roi. Et le roi prit la parole et dit à Daniel   Es-tu ce Daniel, qui es des enfants de la captivité de Juda, que le roi mon père a fait sortir de la juiverie ?  **\nPrière et jeûne   **\nQuand j'ai entendu parler de cela, je me suis demandé comment cela pouvait être fait par moi. À part l'interprétation de Daniel dans les Écritures sur les écrits du roi Belshazzar, je n'avais plus jamais rien entendu de cette nature. Je pensais en moi-même, si Dieu voulait faire de telles merveilles à travers moi, je regarderais comment cela arriverait. J'ai déclaré le jeûne et la prière avec mes dirigeants le lendemain, soit le mardi 23 mai 2017, pour entendre ce que Dieu dirait à ce sujet, tout comme Daniel l'a fait.  **\nDaniel 2 verset 17 à 23   **\n« Alors Daniel s'en alla dans sa maison, et fit connaître la chose à Hanania, Mishael et Azaria, ses compagnons  \nQu'ils désirent la miséricorde du Dieu des cieux concernant ce secret; afin que Daniel et ses compagnons ne périssent pas avec le reste des sages de Babylone.\nAlors le secret fut révélé à Daniel dans une vision nocturne. Alors Daniel bénit le Dieu du ciel. 20 Daniel répondit et dit   Béni soit le nom de Dieu pour toujours et à jamais, car la sagesse et la force sont à lui !\nEt il change les temps et les saisons   il enlève les rois et établit des rois ; il donne la sagesse aux sages, et la connaissance à ceux qui connaissent l'intelligence  \nIl révèle les choses profondes et secrètes   il connaît ce qui est dans les ténèbres, et la lumière habite avec lui.\nJe te remercie et te loue, ô Dieu de mes pères, qui m'as donné la sagesse et la force, et qui m'as fait connaître maintenant ce que nous désirions de toi, car tu nous as maintenant fait connaître l'affaire du roi.\n\nBref témoignage de Sœur Bester Michael The Visioner United Methodist Church, Ham Street, Malali , Kaduna.  **\n+2348135734667\nJe m'appelle Bester S Michael, épouse du pasteur Michael de l'Église méthodiste unie de Kaduna. Nous avons eu une convention régionale des femmes de notre église à Masaka , dans l'État de Nassarawa . J'ai quitté Kaduna avec quelques femmes pour assister à la conférence. Il y avait une forte averse de pluie à notre arrivée à Abuja. Soudain, j'ai commencé à ressentir un grand malaise. Mon souffle a commencé à s'arrêter et la sueur a commencé à couler le long de mon corps. J'avais envie de vomir et j'ai dit au chauffeur de s'arrêter pour que je puisse me soulager. J'ai commencé à prier et à demander grâce à Dieu alors que ma santé empirait. Alors que nous roulions près de l'église de Masaka , j'ai failli m'évanouir. Mon souffle s'arrêtait. Je suppliais encore le Seigneur de me faire miséricorde, car j'avais peur pour mon âme. J'ai enjoint les femmes de prier pour moi et de demander pardon à Dieu dans tous les domaines où j'avais péché contre lui. L'attention du pasteur Alpha fut appelée qui demanda aux femmes de m'amener dans la sacristie. Notre surintendant de district a obtenu des informations sur mon état de santé et a décidé d'intervenir. En moi, je sentais que je n'allais pas survivre, mais que je mourrais. Des prières ont été faites pour moi par d'autres et le surintendant du district, mais en vain. J'ai réussi à participer aux activités de la convention à partir du jeudi 11 mai et le samedi 13 mai 2017, j'ai abandonné l'espoir de rester en vie.  **\nMa rencontre divine\nJ'ai dû appeler mon mari au téléphone pour lui demander de me pardonner si je l'avais offensé ; car j'ai remarqué deux anges attendant de me prendre. J'ai commencé à prêcher aux femmes autour de moi, leur disant de ne jamais chérir ce monde, mais de servir Dieu fidèlement de tout leur cœur. Les anges se sont tenus juste à côté de moi, disant qu'ils étaient venus pour me prendre. Je les ai suppliés de me laisser appeler et parler à mon mari. Soudain, le Seigneur Jésus m'a parlé d'une voix forte, disant qu'il m'avait ajouté des années. Avec la voix autoritaire du Seigneur, la force est venue en moi instantanément. Je suis soudainement devenu en bonne santé et j'ai commencé à louer et à remercier le Seigneur.\nLe Seigneur parla de nouveau et me demanda de voir. Il m'a surnaturellement ouvert les yeux pour voir mon mari prier le Seigneur, pleurant amèrement devant lui, lui demandant d'avoir pitié et d'épargner ma vie, qu'il avait besoin de moi en vie pour le travail du ministère. Le Seigneur a dit  Il a écouté le cri de mon mari pour me garder en vie, mais qu'il me donnerait des messages à transmettre aux autres. J'ai commencé à pleurer et lui ai demandé pourquoi il m'avait choisie, étant la plus jeune parmi les femmes du pasteur.\nLe Seigneur a commencé à parler et m'a demandé de prendre un stylo et du papier. J'ai été étonné, car j'ai demandé aux femmes autour de moi de bien vouloir me procurer un stylo et du papier, mais elles ont carrément refusé de le faire. J'ai demandé encore et encore, leur disant que Jésus m'avait demandé de prendre une feuille d'écriture et un stylo pour que je puisse écrire les messages qu'il voulait que je transmette. Les femmes sont restées inflexibles.\nAucun d'entre eux dans la pièce avec moi n'a tenté de le faire. Je les ai suppliés de m'obtenir une feuille d'écriture et un stylo que le Seigneur m'a commandé de faire ainsi. Ils ont fait la sourde oreille à mon choc et à ma déception. Le Seigneur Jésus s'est tenu juste là avec moi et m'a donné des messages pour eux et je leur ai transmis la même chose. J'ai commencé à remercier et à louer Dieu d'avoir choisi de m'utiliser. Le Seigneur m'a donné un message au pasteur Alpha le pasteur hôte, que je lui ai transmis. Il l'a reçu et a commencé à remercier Dieu. Alors que nous restions en présence du Seigneur, l'un des pasteurs entra. Le Seigneur Jésus commença à parler et nous exhorta à respecter et à honorer nos pasteurs parce qu'en faisant cela nous l'honorons et le respectons. Le Seigneur nous a dit de cesser de manquer de respect à nos pasteurs parce que cela le déshonore ainsi que sa présence. Le Seigneur Jésus par son Esprit m'a dit de ne jamais exposer mon corps à qui que ce soit, sauf à mon mari seul. Il est celui qui est autorisé à voir ma nudité. Cette réprimande est venue parce que je suis sorti pour recevoir de l'air frais sans couvrir mon corps correctement. Je faisais toujours appel aux femmes pour qu'elles m'apportent du matériel d'écriture et un stylo, mais aucune ne prêtait attention à moi. J'ai été ignoré. J'ai été attristé et j'ai tenu et tordu les oreilles de la femme du pasteur Alpha pour son entêtement envers les instructions du Seigneur. Jésus se tenait juste à côté de moi, attendant que je prenne la feuille d'écriture et un stylo. La femme a raté sa bénédiction pour avoir refusé l'instruction du Seigneur et aucune parmi les femmes n'a fait le moindre geste pour le faire. Cependant, l'un des membres de l'église a remarqué à quel point j'étais sérieux concernant la feuille d'écriture et le stylo, elle s'est empressée d'en obtenir un pour moi. Le Seigneur m'a demandé de bénir la femme qui m'a apporté la feuille d'écriture et le stylo. La bénédiction destinée à la femme du pasteur Alpha a été donnée à la femme qui a obéi à ses instructions.  **\nComment j'ai écrit l'écriture mystère   **\nLe Seigneur m'a alors demandé d'écrire. Je suis devenu confus parce que je n'étais pas bon en écriture et en orthographe. Le Seigneur m'a ordonné de commencer à écrire ce que j'ai fait. Alors que je tenais la plume, j'ai commencé à écrire un mystère illisible qu'aucun mortel ne pourrait lire ou interpréter. J'ai écrit sur plusieurs pages, jusqu'à ce que l'Esprit de Dieu me demande de m'arrêter et d'aller me coucher. En me couchant, j'ai commencé à avoir une douce communion avec le Seigneur, tout comme deux amis ayant une conversation privée.\nLes femmes ont commencé à prier, demandant au Seigneur d'utiliser l'une d'elles pour interpréter ce qui était écrit afin que les gens ne doutent pas de l'écriture et du message. Mais le Seigneur a dit que le seul mortel vivant qui serait capable d'interpréter l'écriture mystérieuse était le pasteur Paul Rika, le directeur international du Holiness Revival Movement, Worldwide . Le Seigneur m'a dit que la personne qui m'emmènerait voir le pasteur Paul Rika serait le pasteur Alpha.\nAlors que nous entamions notre voyage de retour vers Kaduna, le Seigneur nous ayant promis la sécurité dans notre voyage, j'ai remarqué des boucles d'oreilles accrochées aux oreilles d'une des femmes et j'ai demandé à la femme si elle connaissait la source de ces boucles d'oreilles. Le Seigneur m'a ouvert les yeux pour voir que les boucles d'oreilles viennent des enfers, des esprits démoniaques. Le Seigneur a donné un avertissement sévère contre l'utilisation de bijoux sur notre corps.  **\nCommentaire du pasteur Alpha Jesmiel Hoki , Pasteur Hôte. \nÉglise méthodiste unie, Demi-tour, Masaka ,    État \nde Nassarawa , +2347063442358\nJe suis Pasteur Alpha de l'Église Méthodiste Unie, Masaka . Je suis témoin de tout ce qui s'est passé à la convention des femmes. Il se trouve que j'étais le conférencier invité à la convention par la grâce de Dieu.\nLaissez-moi vous ramener, dans le passé. Nous avons entendu parler du Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, mais nous n'avons jamais participé au mouvement.\nLe 11 mai 2017, j'étais à Masaka pour la convention des femmes de notre Église. Depuis le 10, j'ai commencé à avoir un sentiment différent. On m'a donné le sujet \"Nous devrions briller comme une lumière dans ce monde\", mais le Seigneur a dit que je devrais changer le sujet en \"Personnage saint dans un lieu saint\", qui était l'un des titres prêchés par le pasteur Paul Rika. J'ai tellement aimé ce sujet.\nPendant la convention, nous nous sommes laissés emporter par tant de choses et nous ne nous sommes pas concentrés sur ce qui nous avait amenés à cette convention. Vendredi, le message m'est venu du Seigneur Jésus que les femmes devraient se consacrer et être saintes parce qu'il les visiterait. J'ai dit aux femmes que nous allions nous engager dans un jeûne de six heures, de 6 heures du matin à midi. Je leur ai dit que le Seigneur Jésus visiterait la convention et qu'ils Le verraient. Après le jeûne, nous avons commencé à prier. J'ai imposé les mains à sœur Bester Michael et j'ai vu la manifestation du Seigneur. Beaucoup de femmes ont commencé à pleurer. A minuit, après la prière, je suis allé dans ma chambre. Je n'avais jamais connu une telle présence du Seigneur, c'était génial. Soudain, j'ai entendu des voix de femmes m'appeler. Au début , j'ai cru qu'ils étaient attaqués. J'ai commencé à prier et à réprimander le diable. Mais le Seigneur Jésus m'a fait comprendre qu'il était celui qui visitait sœur Bester, car j'ai vu plus tôt la manifestation de Dieu sur elle. Le Seigneur Jésus nous a dit de la laisser tranquille. De grandes choses se sont produites cette nuit-là. Le Seigneur a ordonné qu'un stylo et du papier lui soient donnés pour écrire et elle a commencé à écrire des écrits illisibles et mystérieux dont seul Dieu pouvait accorder l'interprétation.\nLe Seigneur Jésus a dit que le seul homme sur terre capable de lire et d'interpréter des écrits aussi mystérieux serait le pasteur Paul Rika. Sœur Bester Michael a dit et écrit de grandes choses ce soir-là. Le Seigneur a soutenu que le pasteur Paul Rika était le seul homme sur terre à interpréter la révélation de ces écrits et que moi, pasteur Alpha, je serais celui qui conduirait sœur Bester à voir le pasteur Paul Rika, le directeur international du Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide.\nCommentaire du pasteur James Michael, époux de la sœur Bester Michael United Methodist Church, Ham Street, Malali , Kaduna. +2347036189472\nJe m'appelle le pasteur James Michael, je suis le pasteur président de l'Église méthodiste unie, région de Malali , État de Kaduna, et le mari de sœur Bester Michael.\nLe jeudi 11 mai 2017, j'ai accompagné ma femme avec le reste des femmes qui se rendaient à Masaka , dans l'État de Nassarawa , au Nigéria, pour leur convention régionale des femmes composée de quatre États. Je n'avais pas la moindre pensée qu'il arriverait quoi que ce soit à ma femme. Tout ce que j'ai remarqué chez ma femme, c'est qu'elle observait quelques jours de jeûne et de prière, selon la conduite du Saint-Esprit, pour des raisons qui m'étaient inconnues. Je n'ai pas demandé non plus. J'ai appris le jeûne quand j'avais besoin d'elle et elle m'a dit qu'elle était en jeûne.\nVers 15 heures, le samedi 13 mai 2017, ma femme de la conférence m'a appelé pour me demander de lui pardonner de quelque manière qu'elle m'ait offensé. Je suis devenu inquiet et j'ai demandé les raisons pour lesquelles elle disait ces choses. Elle a répondu en disant qu'elle était la seule personne qui savait ce qu'elle traversait. Avec cette réponse, je lui ai également demandé de me pardonner de quelque façon que je l'avais aussi offensée. Elle a répondu en disant que je ne l'avais pas du tout offensée.\nJuste à l'endroit où je me tenais dans ma maison, je me suis agenouillé et j'ai commencé à prier Dieu. J'ai crié au Seigneur et je lui ai rappelé qu'il m'avait donné ma femme pour m'aider dans le travail du ministère. J'ai dit au Seigneur que si ma femme venait à mourir, je ne me remarierais pas et je ne m'associerais à personne. J'ai supplié le Seigneur d'avoir pitié et d'épargner la vie de ma femme. A partir de cette période je n'ai reçu aucun appel pour m'informer de l'état de santé de ma femme.\nQuand ma femme est revenue de la convention , j'ai vu une lumière brillante sur elle. Son visage brillait si fort que je ne pouvais pas la regarder librement pendant que je l'observais. Elle a commencé à parler et à me servir.  **\n\n\n\n\nCHAPITRE 12   ** \nL'ÉCRITURE MYSTÈRE ET L'INTERPRÉTATION  **\nL'écriture ci-dessous est de trois pages sur les neuf pages de l'écriture mystérieuse que le Seigneur a demandé à sœur Bester S. Michael d'écrire comme message à l'Église méthodiste. L'interprétation complète suit l'écriture.  **\n\nLa Vision Nocturne Et L' Interprétation   **\nAprès notre prière et notre jeûne du mardi 23 mai, cette nuit-là, le Seigneur a donné la vision suivante  \nC'était comme si des gens se réunissaient dans un auditorium d'église. Un tableau a été placé devant le peuple, sur lequel était collé l'écriture illisible ou le message que Jésus avait donné à sœur Bester pour l'Église méthodiste. Les gens se demandaient comment quelqu'un pouvait lire cette écriture et faire passer le message. À ce stade, moi, le pasteur Paul Rika, suis venu et j'ai commencé à lire l'écriture et à faire connaître le message aux gens. L'écriture ressemblait à une écriture hébraïque pour le peuple. J'ai commencé par dire   « La parole de Dieu dit   **\n« Je réprimande l'Église méthodiste. Vous êtes hors de Mon chemin. Je suis sur le point de te vomir de Ma bouche.  **\n\nApocalypse 3 versets 15 à 20.  **\n« Je connais tes œuvres, que tu n'es ni froid ni bouillant   je voudrais que tu sois froid ou bouillant. 16 Ainsi donc, parce que tu es tiède, et que tu n'es ni froid ni bouillant, je te vomirai de ma bouche.\nParce que tu le dis, je suis riche, et je me suis enrichi de biens, et je n'ai besoin de rien ; et tu ne sais pas que tu es misérable, et misérable, et pauvre, et aveugle, et nu  \nJe te conseille d'acheter de moi de l'or éprouvé par le feu, afin que tu deviennes riche; et des vêtements blancs, afin que tu sois vêtu, et que la honte de ta nudité n'apparaisse pas; et oins tes yeux avec un collyre , afin que tu puisses voir.\nTous ceux que j'aime, je les réprimande et les châtie   aie donc du zèle et repens-toi.\nVoici, je me tiens à la porte et je frappe. Si quelqu'un entend ma voix et ouvre la porte, j'entrerai chez lui, je souperai avec lui, et lui avec moi.  **\nJ'entends le son de votre adoration, mais je ne peux pas voir à travers ceux qui adorent. C'est parce que vous êtes couvert des ténèbres du péché et du mal.  **\nMatthieu 15 verset 7 à 9   **\n« Hypocrites, Ésaïe a bien prophétisé à votre sujet, en disant  \nCe peuple s'approche de moi de sa bouche et m'honore de ses lèvres; mais leur cœur est loin de moi.\nMais c'est en vain qu'ils m'adorent, enseignant comme doctrines des commandements d'hommes.  **\nMéthodistes, vous êtes pleins d'orgueil. Si vous voulez vraiment vous remettre de votre faillite et de votre misère spirituelles, je vous conseille de vous associer au Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide, où vous apprendrez Ma vraie parole pour votre droiture et votre sainteté. Ne méprisez pas Holiness Revival Movement Worldwide (HOREMOW.) J'ai élevé ce ministère, cette fin des temps, en tant que guide spirituel pour toutes les églises du monde. Beaucoup de vos membres qui sont décédés s'en sont rendu compte trop tard pour eux-mêmes. Si vous refusez de vous humilier pour obéir à Mes instructions, vos membres vivants aujourd'hui s'en rendront également compte lorsqu'il sera trop tard pour eux.\nJ'ai décidé de vous transmettre ce message à la base et non à vos principaux dirigeants, car ils ont quitté mon chemin et sont tombés dans divers péchés. Méthodistes, le péché d'adultère, de fornication, d'idolâtrie, de sorcellerie, d'ivresse, de franc-maçonnerie, d'occultisme, de convoitise, d'homosexualité, de lesbianisme, etc. sent parmi vous.  **\nGalates 5 verset 19 à 21   **\n« Maintenant les œuvres de la chair sont manifestes, qui sont celles-ci ; L'adultère, la fornication, l'impureté, la luxure,\n\tL'idolâtrie, la sorcellerie, la haine, la variance, les émulations, la colère, les querelles, les séditions, les hérésies,\nLes envies , les meurtres, l'ivresse, les débauches , etc., dont je vous parle auparavant, comme je vous l'ai également dit dans le passé, que ceux qui commettent de telles choses n'hériteront pas le royaume de Dieu.  **\nRepentez-vous de vos péchés, de peur que je ne vous vomisse de ma bouche. Sachez que lorsque je suis venu au monde en tant qu'être humain, je suis allé vers le peuple, non vers les pharisiens, les scribes et les sadducéens, qui étaient les chefs corrompus du peuple, pleins de vaine gloire.\nLa raison pour laquelle Je n'ai pas raconté cela à Ma fille dans un langage clair, mais que je le lui ai mis dans une écriture inconnue, c'est parce qu'elle n'est pas sainte devant Moi. Elle et son mari ont des défauts dans leur vie qu'ils doivent régler avec Moi. Leur travail n'est pas parfait devant Moi. Ils n'auront pas l'audace de vous déclarer pleinement cette parole, de peur d'être accusés et condamnés par les autres. Cela vous montre les types de pasteurs que vous avez sur vous.\nJ'ai dirigé l'écriture au pasteur Paul Rika comme le seul au monde à lire et à vous faire connaître le message. Ce n'est pas pour sa fierté mais pour vous faire savoir que Je l'ai choisi pour vous faire connaître, à vous et aux autres dans les Églises, Ma parole de vérité, de justice et de sainteté en cette fin des temps de recul et de ténèbres dans les églises.  **\n\n\nActes 9 verset 15.  **\n«Mais le Seigneur lui dit  Va , va; car il m'est un vase d'élection pour porter mon nom devant les nations, les rois et les enfants d'Israël.  **\nJérémie 3 verset 15   **\n\"Et je vous donnerai des pasteurs selon mon coeur, qui vous nourriront de connaissance et d'intelligence.\"  **\nFIN DE L' INTERPRETATION   **\nPasteur Paul Rika\nCette interprétation a été donnée avant que je les rencontre et j'ai vu l'écriture réelle un jour après.  **\n\n\nCHAPITRE 13   ** \nCOMMENTAIRES DES TROIS APRÈS INTERPRÉTATION   **\nPasteur Alpha Jamiel Hoki   **\nConcernant l'interprétation de l'écrit, quand\nLe pasteur Paul Rika a commencé à dire \"Le Seigneur réprimande l'Église méthodiste\". Je l'ai ressenti. C'est vrai parce que nous avons un problème dans notre église moderne à la suite de l'élection de notre évêque. Ce que le Seigneur a dit concernant l'ivresse et les autres péchés qui se produisent dans notre église est vrai. L'interprétation est exactement ce qui se passe. Nous remercions sincèrement le Seigneur pour l'interprétation. Nous promettons au serviteur de Dieu, le pasteur Paul Rika, que nous transmettrons ce message à notre évêque. La copie de cette interprétation sera lue à tous dans nos quatre conférences à travers le Nigeria. Nous nous tiendrons également fermement sur ce que le Seigneur Jésus a dit. Ce que notre Sœur a écrit mystérieusement était certainement ce qu'aucun mortel ne pouvait interpréter. Nous avons reçu des instructions et des directives quant à qui interpréterait une telle écriture mystérieuse et maintenant, en effet, le pasteur Paul Rika a interprété l'écriture mystérieuse. Je ne m'attendais pas à ce que l'interprétation sorte de cette façon. Je loue et remercie le Seigneur pour cela. Maintenant, j'ai un document pour étayer ce que le Seigneur a commencé à faire parmi nous. Au nom de cette Église, nous remercions le Seigneur et son serviteur pour cette grande chose. Notre Église locale et toute l'Église méthodiste adopteront la doctrine de la sainteté afin qu'à la fin de tout cela, nous atteindrons le ciel. C'est notre désir; à part cela, il n'y a rien d'autre que nous désirons.  **\n\n\n\nPasteur James Michael   **\nNous remercions Dieu pour la vie du Pasteur Paul Rika à qui le Seigneur a confié le mandat d'interpréter cette écriture mystérieuse. Je suis pasteur de l'Église Méthodiste Unie. Ce dont le Seigneur a accusé l'église est vrai. Beaucoup de pasteurs sont des ivrognes et des cupides. L'Église traverse actuellement des crises à cause de la décadence morale. Je consens au fait que j'ai des fautes dans ma vie et que mon travail n'est pas parfait devant Dieu   je demande miséricorde à Dieu. Je rends grâce à Dieu d'avoir fait miséricorde à l'Église et d'avoir choisi ce moment pour nous donner ce message. Je prie pour que le Seigneur Jésus nous aide, ainsi que les dirigeants de cette Église dans le monde entier, à examiner cette vision et à apporter un réveil et des changements à cette église afin que les membres parviennent au ciel.  **\nSœur Bester Michael   Je veux apprécier Dieu pour sa miséricorde et sa bonté dans ma vie. Je ne suis pas digne; Honnêtement, je ne me considère pas digne de cet événement. Je veux remercier le Seigneur pour sa miséricorde. Je veux aussi apprécier notre papa, le pasteur Paul Rika, vers qui Dieu m'a dirigé. Je sais que cela vient de Dieu et non de sa propre imagination. Je crois que ce message changera toute l'Église méthodiste au nom de Jésus. Amen. Comme dit dans l'interprétation, la raison pour laquelle le Seigneur ne m'a pas relaté ce message dans un langage clair mais dans une écriture inconnue était parce que je n'étais pas saint devant Lui. C'est vrai, j'ai péché devant Dieu. Je crois que lorsque j'ai cherché sa face après la rencontre, il m'a restauré dans sa miséricorde. J'apprécie Dieu pour cela. Je sais qu'il m'a appelé et c'est lui qui m'a révélé ces choses. Il me conduira et sera avec moi.\nQue le Seigneur augmente la sagesse du pasteur Paul Rika et élargisse son ministère. Je prie pour que Dieu lui accorde une longue vie afin que son travail remplisse le Nigeria et le monde en général. Que Dieu le bénisse abondamment. Je convoite ses prières afin de surmonter ce à quoi nous pourrions être confrontés à la suite de cette révélation et de ce message.  **\nRemarque\nPasteur Michael et Sœur Bester ont cherché des conseils privés avec moi, Pasteur Rika, sur leur vie spirituelle. Ils ont été conseillés sur ce qu'il fallait faire pour se libérer de la culpabilité et de la condamnation pour leur progrès chrétien.  **\nMon observation   **\nMerci à Dieu pour cette interprétation qu'il a révélée dans une vision nocturne. Moi, pasteur Paul Rika, j'ai ajouté les citations des Écritures pour rendre le message plus clair et montrer à quel point il est scripturaire. Que le Seigneur soit honoré dans l'Église méthodiste et dans les autres églises du monde par ce mystère.\nCette grande église a été fondée par John Wesley que le Seigneur a utilisé pour être le pionnier du Mouvement de la Sainteté dans le monde au 18ème siècle . Il a été fondé sur la vérité biblique et a racheté de nombreuses personnes dans le monde. Beaucoup de croyants ont été purifiés dans les Églises. Grâce à son style de vie et à son enseignement, beaucoup sont parvenus au paradis. Il a enseigné la sainteté du cœur à travers une expérience définie de sanctification dans le cœur d'un croyant, qui est nécessaire pour le purifier du péché inné, de la nature adamique ou de la dépravation intérieure, afin de rendre le cœur saint et sans souillure devant Dieu. Il n'a pas seulement mis l'accent sur la sainteté intérieure, il a également enseigné la sainteté extérieure qui implique le retrait des vêtements et des ornements impies pour une conformité totale à la sainteté de Dieu.  **\n2 Corinthiens 7 verset 1   **\n\" Ayant donc ces promesses, bien-aimés, purifions-nous de toute souillure de la chair et de l'esprit, achevant la sainteté dans la crainte de Dieu.\"  **\nLe retrait des bijoux (boucle d'oreille, bagues, anneau de nez, alliance, bracelet, collier, perles et tous les éléments d'ornement) est une commande biblique aux femmes chrétiennes Premier Timothée 2 verset 8 à 10, Nombres 31 verset 50 à 51 . Les femmes chrétiennes doivent porter un couvre-chef approprié lorsqu'elles prient ou lors d' un service d'adoration, 1 Corinthiens 11 versets 3 à 6 . La permanente , le Jerry-curling, l'attachement des cheveux, le tissage, le tressage de la laine dans les cheveux, sont condamnés dans les Écritures. Aussi cortex, rouge à lèvres, peinture du corps, blanchiment, maintien des ongles longs, peinture des ongles, cils artificiels, utilisation de jupes courtes ou de robe, câlins corporels, robes profondes, pantalons également appelés pantalons utilisés par les femmes, voir à travers des robes, des chaussures à talons hauts, des robes avec des pierres brillantes, etc., sont condamnés comme promiscuité et l'habillage de prostituées par l' Écriture. Apocalypse 17 versets 1 à 6.  **\nProverbes 7 verset 10   **\n\"Et voici, il le rencontra une femme avec la tenue d'une prostituée, et subtile de cœur.\"  **\nMais l'ennemi a gravement affecté le travail de John Wesley. Toutes les églises méthodistes de divers noms sont loin des enseignements de John Wesley aujourd'hui. Maintenant, les jeunes de l'église s'habillent avec affaissement, se coupent les cheveux mal, portent des boucles d'oreilles, mettent des vêtements moulants sans réprimande dans l'église. Notez également que le divorce et le remariage lorsque le conjoint, homme ou femme, est encore en vie est un péché pour Dieu, Romains 7 versets 2 et 3 ; 1 Corinthiens 7 versets 10 et 11. La crainte de Dieu a échoué dans de nombreuses congrégations.  **\nMouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde ( Horemow )   **\nDe nos jours, le Seigneur lui-même a suscité le mouvement mondial de réveil de la sainteté (non confessionnel) sous la direction de mon humble moi, le pasteur Paul Rika, le directeur international, pour restaurer la vérité, la justice et la sainteté dans son Église. Grâce au mouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde entier, de nombreux pécheurs sont amenés au Seigneur et les croyants sont sanctifiés et rendus saints dans le monde entier. C'est un ministère non confessionnel à croissance rapide qui a couvert environ 40 nations du monde au moment d'écrire ces lignes.  **\nLe signe de sa venue   **\nC'est l'un des signes du retour prochain du Seigneur. Croyez-le, ce n'est pas fait par l'homme. C'est un message à toutes les Églises. Le Seigneur de l'Église réprimande toutes les églises tièdes et rétrogrades et les appelle à la repentance et à la sainteté. Les prédicateurs doivent se repentir de leurs péchés et prêcher le vrai message de l'évangile de la repentance, de la justice et de la sainteté pour préparer leurs membres à l'enlèvement qui vient le plus tôt possible. Les membres d'églises rétrogrades qui rejettent la sainteté et l'avertissement de Dieu doivent permettre à Dieu de les conduire à Sa Vérité, Sa Justice et Sa Sainteté pour leur aptitude spirituelle et leur préparation à l'Enlèvement. Ne vous soumettez pas à une église compromettante, résistante à la vérité et remplie de péchés, sans vous soucier de leur colère ou de leur amour.  **\nHébreux 12 verset 14   **\n\"Suivez la paix avec tous les hommes et la sainteté, sans laquelle personne ne verra le Seigneur.\"  **\nPremier Jean 3 verset 2 et 3   **\n« Bien-aimés , nous sommes maintenant fils de Dieu, et ce que nous serons n'apparaît pas encore ; mais nous savons que, lorsqu'il apparaîtra, nous serons semblables à lui ; car nous le verrons tel qu'il est.\nEt tout homme qui a cette espérance en lui se purifie , comme il est pur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "LA PASSION DE LA PURETÉ   **\n\nPRÉSENTATION   **\nLa Bible dit dans Matthieu 5 verset 8 « Heureux ceux qui ont le cœur pur car ils verront Dieu ». Seule la pureté nous fera voir Dieu. Dans cette génération, il y a des confusions partout, il faut faire très attention pour pouvoir faire le paradis.\nEn lisant ce livre, le Seigneur vous aidera à être pur ; non seulement pur mais passionné par la pureté.\nvous bénisse   **\n\nChapitre Un   Passion pour la Pureté    **\n \nQu'est-ce que la Passion ?   **\nLa passion signifie un fort désir; pas seulement un désir mais un fort. C'est la tension du cœur à cause de quelque chose de fortement désiré, quelque chose de souhaité, quelque chose qui doit être fait ou ne pas être fait.\nLa passion est un désir intérieur. Vous êtes accablé dans votre cœur pour quelque chose ou contre quelque chose. La passion est une forte détermination. Le cœur passionné n'est libéré que lorsque le désir est atteint. Lorsque ce qui est désiré est accompli, on dit que la passion est atteinte.\nLa passion, par exemple on peut dire « il l'aime avec passion, avec beaucoup de force ».\nLa quantité d'un tel amour est profondément à l'intérieur. On peut aussi dire   « elle le hait avec passion » ; ce qui signifie que la force de la haine est vraiment élevée.\nMais nous parlons de la passion de la pureté. Vous pouvez maintenant comprendre non seulement la pureté, mais la passion pour celle-ci. Vouloir être pur et le vouloir avec passion, avec un grand désir. Vouloir la vie pure, le cœur pur ; en toute envie et en toute détermination. Votre cœur devrait y être. Dites-vous que je dois être pur. Je dois être saint et parfait.\nLaissons la Bible nous ouvrir davantage les yeux sur la passion comme dans   **\n\nPsaumes 42 verset 1 à 5   **\n« Comme le cerf soupire après les ruisseaux d'eau, ainsi mon âme soupire après toi, ô Dieu.\nMon âme a soif de Dieu, du Dieu vivant, quand viendrai-je comparaître devant Dieu ?\nMes larmes ont été ma nourriture jour et nuit, alors qu'ils me disent sans cesse où est ton Dieu ? Quand je me souviens de ces choses, je répands mon âme en moi, car j'étais allé avec la multitude, je suis allé avec eux à la maison de Dieu, avec une voix de joie et de louange, avec une multitude qui célébrait la fête.\nPourquoi es-tu abattu, ô mon âme ? et pourquoi t'inquiètes-tu de moi ? Espère en Dieu, car je le louerai encore pour le secours de son visage ».  **\n \nLa Passion du Psalmiste .  **\n \nLa passion est décrite par certains termes. Comme le cerf panteth l'implique, l'animal cherche les ruisseaux d'eau pour pouvoir boire et étancher sa soif. Panteth, c'est comme quand quelqu'un court et après cela, il commence à respirer fortement, en faisant un son lourd parce que la force à l'intérieur est élevée. le souffle est aussi à haute tension. Il libère l'air fortement à l'intérieur à cause de la force générée par la course. Panteth signifie que vous cherchez désespérément la chose comme si sans elle vous alliez mourir. Un animal dans une telle situation sautera, haletera et le cherchera. Ainsi soupire mon âme après toi, ô Dieu. Votre âme aspire-t-elle ainsi à Dieu ? Il y a une grande soif en moi. Regardez-le   « Mon âme a soif de Dieu. » Quand vous voyez un homme assoiffé de Dieu ; il y aura une tension à l'intérieur de celui qui veut être satisfait du Saint. Esaü avait la passion de la nourriture. Il avait tellement faim qu'il a vendu son droit d'aînesse. Le désir était tellement en lui. Il le gouvernait et le contrôlait.  **\n \nSoif passionnée de Dieu .  **\n \nQuand viendrai-je comparaître devant Dieu ? Lorsque le mot «quand» fait partie de la passion, il dénote le désespoir de passer du temps avec Dieu. Quand cela sera-t-il réalisé ? Quand puis-je arriver à la solution à cela? Quand vais-je apparaître ? Quand dira-t-on que je l'ai eu ? Tel est celui qui le recherche avec passion.  **\nMes larmes ont été ma viande révélée, je pleure pour cela. Je pleure à cause du désir. Des larmes coulent de mes yeux (passion). Parce que j'aspire à cela, je pleure, je n'ai pas d'autre choix que de pleurer pour cela. Les larmes tomberont juste de mes yeux; coule sur mes joues.\nMon coeur est là. Quand vais-je l'obtenir ? Mes larmes ont été ma viande jour et nuit révèle que, la passion n'est pas une chose occasionnelle. Pas seulement de temps en temps. je suis dedans. Le désir est continu. Mon désir est continu; jour et nuit. C'est là que mon cœur est. C'est la passion. Jour et nuit, alors que je me souviens de ces choses, mon cœur est toujours là. Il y a une pensée à l'intérieur qui le contrôle. Et une telle pensée réchauffe toujours ses souvenirs.  **\n\" Quand je me souviens de ces choses, je répands mon âme en moi  car j'étais allé avec la multitude, je suis allé avec eux à la maison de Dieu, avec une voix de joie et de louange, avec une multitude qui célébrait la fête\" .  **\nAlors pourquoi cette chose retarde-t-elle; pourquoi es-tu abattu ? Voyez-vous comment cela l'affecte qu'un tel désir retarde? Je tarde à y parvenir, pourquoi ? Pourquoi t'inquiètes-tu de moi ? Il y a de l'inquiétude et de l'agitation dans mon cœur. Pourquoi suis-je agité ? A cause de la Passion ! « Pourquoi es-tu inquiet, espère en Dieu   car je le louerai encore pour le secours de son visage ».\nFoi et espérance en Dieu. \nL'homme passionné a l'espoir et la foi que cela se fera. Il le poursuit avec passion. Cela doit être fait. Il court après avec passion. Il s'encourage et dit; Dieu m'aidera. Il sera accompli.  **\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapitre 2   \nLa pureté en Christ     **\n \nHébreux 7 verset 25 à 27   **\n « C'est pourquoi il peut aussi sauver parfaitement ceux qui s'approchent de Dieu par lui, étant toujours vivant pour intercéder en leur faveur.\nCar un tel souverain sacrificateur est devenu nous, qui sommes saints, inoffensifs, sans souillure, séparés des pécheurs et élevés au-dessus des cieux ;\nQui n'a pas besoin quotidiennement, comme ces souverains sacrificateurs, d'offrir des sacrifices, d'abord pour ses propres péchés, puis pour ceux du peuple ; pour cela, il l'a fait une fois, lorsqu'il s'est offert lui-même ».  **\n  \nL'Écriture décrit Jésus lorsqu'il est venu en tant qu'être humain comme nous. Quelle était sa qualité ? Quel était Son attribut ? Comment a-t-il vécu ? Quelle était sa vie ? La Bible dit   « Il était saint ».\nJésus en tant qu'être humain, quand il est venu parmi les siens et a vécu parmi nous; Il était saint, pur et sans souillure. Aucune souillure, aucune chose sale n'était en Lui; dans la vie, dans le langage, dans les actions. En tout, rien de sale.\nIl était sans souillure. Il était inoffensif, ne blessait pas les gens, pas impoli, pas fier et rien qui ferait du mal aux gens. Il était inoffensif. C'est ainsi que Jésus était. Il a été séparé des pécheurs. Il n'a pas vécu comme des pécheurs. Il n'a pas partagé la vie avec les pécheurs. Il n'a pas vécu dans le péché avec les pécheurs. Il a vécu une vie séparée, pas comme un ivrogne, un fornicateur, un voleur ou un menteur. Il était totalement séparé du péché; pur et saint. C'était Sa vie. Dieu veut nous amener à ce point d'être purs, saints, sans souillure, séparés du péché et des pécheurs. Il veut vous mener jusqu'à ce point. Il veut vous amener à cette norme.  **\nC'est pourquoi, il peut aussi sauver parfaitement ceux qui viennent à Dieu par lui; voyant qu'il est toujours vivant pour intercéder en leur faveur. Deux choses   Sa capacité et Son intercession pour vous amener à ce point. Que vous êtes pur, parfait, sans péché dans votre vie. Il n'y a aucune souillure dans votre langue, dans votre cœur, dans votre corps et dans votre nature. Il n'y a pas de souillure comme Il l'était. Ainsi, Il est capable de vous y emmener. C'est la vision que vous devriez avoir. C'est la vision de la pureté et la vision de la sainteté. Voir là-bas. C'est là que Dieu veut vous emmener. Voyez-vous ce grand arbre là-bas? c'est la sainteté, c'est la pureté. Dieu veut vous emmener à cet arbre. Vous serez assis sous cet arbre. Il veut vous y emmener. Vous mangerez les fruits de cet arbre, c'est la vision. Cet arbre est votre destination. C'est là que Dieu veut vous emmener. C'est là qu'Il est.\nAinsi, vous avez vu la vision. Alors croyez en sa capacité de vous y emmener parce qu'il en est capable. Oubliez les infirmités de votre corps ; oubliez votre faiblesse naturelle et votre environnement corrompu. Croyez en lui qu'il est capable de vous y emmener. Vous avez vu la vision, alors croyez en Dieu.  **\nAbandonnez-vous à Lui pour vous y porter. Il connaît le chemin pour vous y emmener. Vous mangerez les fruits de cet arbre. Vous apprécierez l'ombre de cet arbre. Vous apprécierez la brise fraîche sous cet arbre. Le Seigneur vous conduira à ce point de sainteté. Son intercession  \nC'est la Grâce. Ce n'est pas votre force en ce moment mais la provision de Grâce. Sa prière à Dieu pour vous fournira la grâce. Croyez simplement. Avec la provision de grâce, vous arriverez à la perfection. Vous arriverez à la pureté du cœur. Vous arriverez à la sainteté de la vie. Dieu vous aidera. C'est une expérience instantanée dès que vous le demandez avec foi par la prière.  **\nQuand le Seigneur a dit à Ézéchiel, Ézéchiel 37 verset 3 « fils d'homme, ces ossements vivront ; » parce qu'ils étaient très secs, il sut répondre à Dieu   « tu le sais ». Parce qu'avec tes yeux, tu pourrais te décourager mais puisque Dieu t'a amené là et t'a montré; ne te fie pas aux yeux. Foi! Tu sais. Vous êtes capable par sa puissance et sa provision de grâce. Je peux être pur. Mon cœur sera pur. Ma vie sera pure. Je vivrai une vie sainte.  **\nHébreux 9 versets 13 à 14 dit      **\n« Car le sang des taureaux et des boucs, et la cendre d'une génisse qui asperge l'impur, sanctifie pour la purification de la chair ;\nCombien plus le sang du Christ, qui par l'Esprit éternel s'est offert sans tache à Dieu, purifiera-t-il votre conscience des œuvres mortes pour servir le Dieu vivant ?  **\n  \nL'Écriture nous donne l'assurance ici. Avant la venue de Jésus, les hommes qui adoraient Dieu vivaient par l'œuvre purificatrice du sang des animaux, des chèvres, des génisses, etc. Par le sang des animaux alors qu'ils offraient des sacrifices, les animaux étaient tués pour les hommes et ils étaient pardonnés dans le passé. Parce que la Bible dit que l'âme qui pèche, elle doit mourir (Ezéchiel 18 verset 20) . Et Dieu a porté qu'un animal puisse mourir à la place de l'homme afin que la loi soit accomplie selon laquelle le péché est payé par la mort ou payé par la mort (ombrage du sang comme type de Christ dans l'Ancien Testament).\nUne fois qu'un péché est commis, par exemple une fois qu'un mensonge a été dit, dans les annales de Dieu et dans l'action de Dieu ; dans le récit de ce mensonge, une vie devait mourir pour cela. Un animal devait mourir parce qu'un mensonge avait été dit. Si quelqu'un entrait dans le péché de sexe; pour cet art de l'immoralité, un animal devait mourir pour que cette immoralité soit pardonnée. Rien d'autre que la mort ne pouvait le régler. Vous pourriez le faire et dire que je suis désolé, mais un animal devait mourir. Vous êtes désolé parce que quelqu'un doit mourir ou devrait mourir pour que ce péché vous soit pardonné.\nDans l'Ancien Testament; avant la venue de Jésus, normalement un animal doit mourir pour chaque péché ? Si vous avez commis un péché, un animal devait mourir. Et par la mort de l'animal; Dieu a pardonné les péchés, a été purifié du péché et a enlevé le registre du péché de votre vie parce qu'un animal était mort. La Bible dit « si le sang des animaux pouvait être considéré par Dieu » parce qu'un animal a souffert pour vous ; sa souffrance et sa mort pourraient être considérées par Dieu comme représentant votre mort et ainsi le péché est vaincu. Combien plus le sang de Christ qui est supérieur à l'animal ? Combien plus la mort et la souffrance de Christ seront-elles plus grandes qu'animales, plus pures qu'animales; le sang du Christ qui par l'Esprit éternel s'est offert sans tache à Dieu, vous purifie-t-il ? Combien ce sang réglera-t-il définitivement le même problème dans votre vie ?  **\nDans quelle mesure la puissance de ce sang purgera-t-elle le péché de vos consciences et réglera-t-elle la question du péché dans votre propre vie ? Par conséquent, ayez confiance en Christ. Il peut vous amener à cette perfection grâce à Son sang ; la supériorité de Son sang, Sa mort pour toute vie. Les animaux devaient mourir régulièrement parce que les hommes péchaient tout le temps. Certaines personnes tomberaient aujourd'hui, tomberaient demain. Mais le Christ est mort une fois ! Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire. Qu'il est mort une fois ? Cela signifie qu'il peut vous amener au point de pureté et vous y resterez. Vous ne retournez plus au péché. Il vous amène au point de pureté. Il vous purifie au point que vous ne péchez plus. Dans 1 Jean 2 verset 1, la Bible dit   « Mes petits enfants, je vous écris ces choses, afin que vous ne péchiez pas…. « Je vous écris que vous ne devez pas pécher. Pourquoi? Il est mort pour vous. Jésus ne meurt pas tous les jours. Cela signifie que vous ne devriez pas pécher tous les jours.\nBien que la miséricorde de Dieu soit là pour ceux qui pèchent, Il dit « reviens ». Jésus est toujours là. Revenez à Lui et restaurez-vous à la pureté parfaite. Non pas que vous devriez être en train de pécher, Non ! La Bible dit dans 1 Jean 3 verset 9 que « Quiconque est né de Dieu ne commet pas de péché ». Pourquoi péchez-vous ? Christ a-t-il besoin de mourir chaque jour ? Non! Vous dites « vous savez que nous sommes des chrétiens imparfaits ! Dieu sait que nous pouvons pécher tous les jours ! Ce sont des paroles de gens du monde, ceux qui ne connaissent pas encore profondément Jésus.  **\nLe Christ meurt-il chaque jour ? Non! Alors pourquoi devez-vous pécher ? Il est capable de les sauver au maximum. Il est capable de vous amener à la perfection de la vie par cette seule mort à cause de Son sang ; le sang du Christ. Ayez confiance en ce sang. Crois le. Il y a des gens qui ont cru et vivent quotidiennement dans la droiture et la sainteté . Il y a des gens qui vivent comme ça. Leurs vies sont pures, saintes et parfaites. Dieu est mort pour vous une fois. Par cette mort unique, cela signifie que vous venez à Christ et que vous vous établissez dans sa pureté. Votre pureté continue. C'est ce que la parole de Dieu nous dit.  **\nEphésiens 5 versets 25 à 27   **\n\n« Maris , aimez vos femmes, comme Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle ; Afin qu'il la sanctifie et la purifie par le lavage d'eau par la parole,\nAfin qu'il puisse se la présenter comme une église glorieuse, n'ayant ni tache, ni ride, ni quoi que ce soit de semblable ; mais qu'il soit saint et sans défaut .\nMaris, aimez votre femme, comme Christ a aussi aimé l'église.  **\nQuelle est l'église? C'est un corps de croyants. Autant de ceux qui sont nés de nouveau; ils sont l'église, membres de son propre corps. Comment sont-ils nés de nouveau ? Parce que Christ est mort pour le monde; Christ est mort pour les pécheurs. Ils ont cru au Seigneur Jésus et sont nés de nouveau. Étant nés de nouveau, ils sont devenus une partie de l'église du Christ. La Bible nous dit que Christ est mort pour l'église et pour les pécheurs.  **\n 1 Corinthiens 15 verset 3     **\n« Car je vous ai livré premièrement ce que j'ai aussi reçu, comment le Christ est mort pour nos péchés selon les Écritures ».  **\nIl est mort pour les pécheurs, pour nos péchés selon les Écritures.  **\nPremier Timothée 1 verset 15   **\n« C'est une parole fidèle et digne de toute acceptation que le Christ Jésus est venu dans le monde pour sauver les pécheurs, dont je suis le premier .  **\nChrist est venu sauver les pécheurs. Il est mort pour nos péchés. Il est mort pour les pécheurs. Il est mort pour le monde. Mais dans Ephésiens 5 versets 25 à 27 , Il est mort pour l'église. Pourquoi? Pour purifier l'église, la sanctifier et se présenter à Lui-même une église glorieuse. Cela signifie que le message de pureté et de sainteté vient à l'église.  **\nLe Message de la repentance parvient aux pécheurs dans le monde. Lorsque vous allez dans le monde, prêchez et dites   « Repentez-vous de vos péchés et croyez au Seigneur Jésus-Christ ». Maintenant, quand vous venez à l'église; Il est mort pour l'église; pour la sainteté de l'église. Alors Il dit à l'église; ''soumettez-vous pour la purification de votre vie''. Purifiez votre cœur, sanctifiez votre cœur et soumettez-vous à nouveau au Christ.\nComme les pécheurs ont cru en lui pour être sauvés de leurs péchés, venez à Christ et croyez en lui aussi pour votre pureté afin qu'il puisse vous donner le salut le plus complet. Il est capable de vous sauver au maximum. Il peut faire le nettoyage dans votre vie appelé\n'sanctification' et élever votre vie à une norme sainte selon laquelle vous n'avez pas besoin de pécher et de dire \"désolé d'avoir dit un mensonge, désolé d'avoir fait ceci, désolé d'avoir fait ceci, etc\". Non!\nIl vous amène à l'état de pureté continue. Il est mort pour l'église. Il est mort pour vous qui avez déjà cru. L'évangile de la pureté du cœur vient à vous et à l'église, pourquoi ? Bien que nous ayons appris à aimer Jésus, il y a des choses que nous faisons lorsque nous vivons les uns avec les autres. Nous faisons des choses qui sont mauvaises. Nous manifestons toujours une certaine fierté et nous sommes toujours en compétition les uns avec les autres. Nous sommes toujours en colère les uns contre les autres.\nNous nous envions. Vous chantez dans la chorale mais il y a une lutte entre vous et votre sœur. Vous remarquez qu'il y a une certaine sainteté en vous, mais quelques petits mensonges sont encore racontés. Notez que Sarah n'est pas née de nouveau mais quand\nSarah a été mise au défi, a-t-elle dit; \"Non, je n'ai pas dit une telle chose\". Dieu a dit, 'Tu l'as dit, pourquoi tu mens?' Sara n'était-elle pas une femme pieuse ? Dieu mais il y avait encore des mensonges. Toutes ces impuretés disparaîtront au fur et à mesure que vous croirez en l'Évangile de sanctification afin que votre cœur atteigne un niveau supérieur.\nLe Seigneur fortifiera ce cœur avec la sainteté. Amen!  **\nVous pouvez maintenant vivre la vie sainte. Un peu d'entêtement et de rébellion que l'on voit dans l'église, tu es toujours volontaire, très fort dans ta volonté même quand les choses ne vont pas bien   tu dis que je suis un leader ! Je suis chrétien, si je prêche, des signes et des prodiges suivront, etc. Mais votre vie n'est pas assez bonne. Il y a quelque chose que vous savez qui n'est pas complet dans votre vie.\nChrist est mort pour l'église. Vous faites partie de cette église. Christ est mort pour que l'église la purifie. Vous avez besoin d'une autre œuvre de purification de Jésus pour vous purifier. Vous avez besoin d'une autre œuvre purificatrice de Jésus. Le premier a été fait quand vous avez été enlevé du péché et purifié pour venir à l'église en tant que croyant. Maintenant, vous êtes un croyant et vous êtes dans l'église. Ensuite, le second doit être fait pour vous choisir comme croyant, vous purifier, vous sanctifier et ensuite vous rendre à la vie sainte.\nChrist est mort pour les pécheurs. Il est mort pour le monde, la première provision d'eau; l'eau de régénération. Par elle les péchés du pécheur sont lavés. Car vous êtes lavés par l'eau de la régénération mais alors, Christ a fourni une autre eau. Il est mort pour l'église, pourquoi ? C'est cette autre eau   la sanctification, la pureté intérieure. C'est une seconde touche de pureté qui est aussi une seconde touche de sainteté et une seconde touche de droiture que vous pourriez maintenant être sans tache ni ride ou quoi que ce soit de ce genre. Par conséquent, vous maintenez maintenant la vie de Sainteté. Si nous disons maintenant sortons pour l'évangélisation et prêchons aux gens, que leur dites-vous ? Repentez-vous et croyez en Jésus; acceptez Jésus et vos péchés seront pardonnés et vous aurez une nouvelle vie. Ensuite, nous vous prêcherons aussi, venez à ce même Jésus pour la sanctification de votre cœur comme vous avez dit au pécheur de venir pour sa repentance. En tant que chrétien, il est mort aussi pour vous, afin que vous soyez sanctifiés. Votre cœur devrait être purifié en premier lieu, mais il a besoin d'une deuxième purification pour vous amener au point où vous êtes sans tache ni ride ou quoi que ce soit de ce genre.  **\nAlors que vous coulez dans la Sainteté. Prenez note, Il est mort pour nous une fois. Il n'a pas besoin de mourir quotidiennement. Cela signifie que vous devez vous élever vers la Sainteté et y continuer. Ce n'est pas à vous d'être Saint aujourd'hui et demain vous tombez et dites   'Jésus est encore mort pour moi'. Je t'en prie, non!!! Venu à une vie standard, une mort est la provision. Christ peut vous garder dans la sainteté tous les jours de votre vie.  **\nLuc. 1 verset 74 à 75   **\n« Qu'il nous accorde que nous, étant délivrés de la main de nos ennemis, puissions le servir sans crainte,\nDans la sainteté et la justice devant lui, tous les jours de notre vie ».  **\n  \nIl est mort une fois pour y parvenir. Alors pourquoi pécher aujourd'hui et pécher demain ? Non! Ne fais pas ça. Tous les jours de notre vie, la cohérence dans la justice est ce que Dieu veut que nous atteignions la sainteté et la justice devant Dieu. Devant le monde, même notre prédication et notre prière sont une offense. Le monde, votre voisin pourrait voir votre prédication et dire que vous êtes une personne méchante. C'est parce que vous ne prêchez rien d'autre que la dure vérité que les gens du monde ne comprendraient pas. Enlever des bijoux et ne plus peindre fera de vous une offense à votre mari. Ainsi, vous ne serez pas une personne acceptée. Devant lui, tu es une femme méchante. Mais devant Dieu, qui voit le coeur; Il vous accompagnera grâce à cette œuvre que Jésus a accomplie dans votre vie. Il vous verra saint et juste tous les jours de votre vie.  **\n \nChapitre trois   Passion pour la pureté personnelle   **\n \nMaintenant que vous avez connu la pureté en Christ, comment l'obtenez-vous, pour que cette chose soit réelle dans votre vie ?  **\nMatthieu 5 verset 6      **\n\" Heureux ceux qui ont faim et soif de la justice, car ils seront rassasiés \".\nFaim et soif! Souvenez-vous de notre passion. Il y a une force à l'intérieur; un fort désir à l'intérieur de vous à la recherche d'un état de pureté et d'un cœur de sainteté qui devrait être là. Voyons cette passion, voyons cette force, voyons-nous courir, voyons-nous haleter et voyons-nous pleurer. Laissez-nous vous voir pleurer et désirer; car tu seras rassasié. Dieu vous comblera et Dieu vous donnera la pureté. Celui qui voit votre lutte vous satisfera et vous serez comblé.  **\nPsaumes 139 versets 23 à 24    **\n« Sonde -moi, ô Dieu, et connais mon cœur, éprouve-moi, et connais mes pensées,\nEt vois s'il y a en moi quelque voie mauvaise, et conduis-moi dans la voie éternelle \".  **\n\nVous voyez un homme qui ne veut pas de mauvaise voie en lui. Il ne le prendra pas. Dieu, je ne peux pas enlever la méchanceté en moi, viens m'aider. Comment puis-je manifester de la fierté ? Comment un mensonge peut-il sortir de ma bouche ? Dieu me cherche, vérifie-moi et s'il y a quelque chose en moi, purifie-moi, purge-moi. Purifie-moi avec l'hysope et je serai propre . Lavez-moi et je serai plus blanc que neige. Si tu me laves, je serai propre. Si tu me purges, je serai plus blanc que neige. Sondez ma vie et voyez s'il y a une mauvaise voie en moi et rendez-moi parfait. Pouvez-vous voir un homme avec une passion? Ce type d'homme ne vivra pas dans la colère. Ce type de chrétien ne permettra pas à la colère d'être en lui. Il doit le porter à Dieu et dire qu'il ne doit pas être là.\nCe type de chrétien ne peut pas permettre aux lèvres de mentir. Non. O, qu'est-ce que j'ai dit hier ? Ô Dieu, pardonne-moi. Que cela ne se répète plus. Il ne faut pas. Ce type de chrétien ne peut pas permettre la luxure ! Quoi, comment me suis-je senti, que s'est-il passé ? Pas moi encore par Sa grâce. Dieu, cela ne peut pas être dans ma vie. Ce genre de chrétien ne peut pas se permettre l'orgueil. Dieu, j'ai fait quelques performances devant les gens et je me sens bien. Qu'est-ce qui cause ça ? Je ne peux pas lui permettre de rester.\nC'est la passion qui est nécessaire pour atteindre la pureté. C'est à cause de cela que vous irez vers Dieu et ne lui donnerez aucun repos jusqu'à ce qu'il vous établisse. La passion est le pouvoir à l'intérieur et un fort désir. Vous prierez et prierez jusqu'à ce que vous y arriviez. Je vous ai raconté la vision de la sainteté et de la pureté comme ce grand arbre que vous voyez là. C'est votre destination. Vous devez manger le fruit de cet arbre. Vous devez être sous les feuilles de cet arbre et profiter de l'ombre. Mais il y a des gens qui disent à leur congrégation, 'ce n'est pas possible'. Aucune destination n'est fixée devant eux. Vous ne pouvez pas réaliser quelque chose que vous n'avez pas comme objectif. Mais Jésus est prêt à sauver au maximum. Il est prêt à vous emmener là-bas; au point de cette vision qu'Il a placée devant nous; pour nous perfectionner et nous purger, afin que nous puissions être purs.\nDaniel avait la passion de la pureté et c'est ce qui l'a poussé à maintenir sa pureté dans des circonstances difficiles et un environnement difficile.  **\nDaniel 1 verset 8   **\n\" Mais Daniel avait résolu dans son cœur de ne pas se souiller avec la portion de viande du roi, ni avec le vin qu'il buvait; c'est pourquoi il demanda au prince des eunuques de ne pas se souiller .\"  **\nLa passion de la pureté vous rendra pur face à Nabuchodonosor. Cela vous rendra pur face à un homme violent. Cela vous rendra pur face à la mort parce que vous êtes pour la pureté du cœur intérieur. Vous vous surveillez tellement que vous ne permettrez jamais le péché. Vous vérifiez toujours chaque pas que vous faites en tant que croyant. Avez-vous vu un minou? Lorsque le minou court d'ici à là, il s'arrête et se lèche le corps. Toute poussière qui est venue sur lui, il la lèche. Même les jambes qui touchent le sol, il va le lécher et le nettoyer. Avez-vous vu ceux qui y sont habitués comme ça, ça a marché pour eux. Ayez la passion de la pureté. Vous devez vérifier vous-même. Vérifiez et léchez n'importe quoi, tout ce qui est péché dans votre corps doit être léché. Passion! Daniel s'est proposé dans son cœur. Comment garder la colère et la méchanceté ? Pas moi par Sa grâce. Ce n'est pas possible. Je ne peux pas le permettre. Je vérifie moi-même.  **\nAprès que j'ai parlé, et que j'ai regardé, 'est-ce que j'ai dit du mal, est-ce que du mal est sorti de là ?' Combien plus quand j'ai remarqué que je parlais mal; que le mal ne doit pas se répéter.\nPassion! Le cœur est composé. Je dois être pur. C'est ce que Dieu veut que je sois. Décidez-vous comme ça; qu'il faut être pur. Examinez-vous quotidiennement. Vérifiez-vous constamment dans toutes les formes de vie. À la maison, dans le mariage, au travail, à l'église, dans le ministère chrétien, en tout, bilan de santé. Examinez votre attitude envers l'argent; personnes; femmes et face aux vicissitudes de la vie. Vérifiez-le, ne le permettez pas. Daniel s'est proposé dans son cœur. Pas même devant des hommes, pas devant des brigands armés tu ne diras pas de mensonges. Vous ne pouvez pas. Celui qui est né de Dieu ne commet pas de péché . Il ne pèche pas. Il ne peut pas pécher. Il est né de Dieu.  **\nDécide toi. Vous ne pouvez pas pécher devant des voleurs armés. Vous ne pouvez pas pécher. Vous ne pouvez pas mentir parce que vous voulez vous échapper. Vous échapper d'où, quand vous avez Dieu qui vous regarde ? Décide toi. Ne laissez pas les gens voir que vous utilisez le mensonge pour dissimuler la vérité à votre sujet, c'est le mal. Pas possible. Daniel s'est proposé dans son cœur. C'est la passion. De cette façon donc, vous avez la pureté.  **\nActes 24 verset 16    **\n\" Et c'est en cela que je m'exerce, à avoir toujours une conscience sans offense envers Dieu, et envers les hommes \".  **\nJ'exerce la pureté et la conscience. Je m'exerce à garder une conscience pure. Y a-t-il quelque chose que je ne comprends pas, est-ce que je pèche ici ? Ne suis-je pas en train de pécher ici, y a-t-il quelque chose qui ne va pas? Apportez-le à Dieu dans les prières jusqu'à ce que la lumière y vienne. Ayez toujours une conscience sans offense.\nConscience pure !  **                                                        \n\nLa pureté et les yeux    **\n \nLa pureté et tes yeux Job 31 verset 1 et 2   **\n« J'ai fait alliance avec mes yeux ; pourquoi donc penserais-je à une servante ? Car quelle part de Dieu y a-t-il d'en haut ? Et quel héritage du Tout-Puissant d'en haut ?\nJ'ai conclu une alliance avec mes yeux. Comme je travaille dans la rue et que je vois la nudité dans la rue ; pourquoi vais-je entrer dans la nudité d'une femme? Pourquoi est-ce que je fais ça ? Quelle part de Dieu y a-t-il dans une servante ? Est-ce que cela va me rendre juste, plus juste ? Est-ce que ça va me donner la grâce? Pour la vie chrétienne et le service, cela va-t-il me faire chanter et bénir Dieu ? Quelle partie y a-t-il sur laquelle je devrais poser mes yeux et contempler leur nudité ? Jamais! Je parle de celui qui a la passion de la pureté. Ses yeux sont réglés; il les détourne de voir la vanité comme la danse. Ils dansent disco là-bas. Ces choses qu'ils dansent à la télévision et les femmes qui dansent nues, quel plaisir puis-je en retirer ? De quelle manière est-ce que je reçois l'onction ? De quelle manière est-ce que je reçois la grâce ? Si je fixe mes yeux sur ces garçons, les garçons corrompus à l'écran qui dansent avec les filles corrompues (elles sont là-bas en pantalon, les seins exposés avec leur nudité), dois-je prendre du plaisir ? Cela va corrompre mon cœur.\nC'est la pureté et les yeux.  **\n \n \n \nLa pureté et la langue    **\n \nJames. 1 verset 26   **\n« Si quelqu'un parmi vous semble être religieux, et ne bride pas sa langue, mais trompe son propre cœur, la religion de cet homme est vaine ».\nVous avez la grâce, vous avez un don et vous avez un appel, bridez et contrôlez votre langue ; sinon vous vous trompez en disant que vous servez Dieu. Mais vous faites de la vanité. C'est ce que dit l'Écriture. Si quelqu'un parmi vous semble être religieux et ne bride pas sa langue ou ne la contrôle pas; se trompe. \nCar en beaucoup de choses nous offensons tout le monde. La langue est un petit membre mais elle est mise sur un feu d'enfer.   **\nJacques 3 versets 2 à 6    **\n« Car en bien des choses nous offenserons tous. Si quelqu'un n'offense pas en paroles, c'est un homme parfait, et capable de brider tout le corps.   **\nContrôlez votre parole et votre langue. Faites attention à ce que vous dites. Il doit y avoir de la sainteté dans la langue et de la pureté dans la langue ; si la langue sera au repos.  **\n « Voici , nous mettons des mors dans la bouche des chevaux, afin qu'ils nous obéissent ; et nous tournons tout leur corps .\n Voici aussi les navires, qui, bien qu'ils soient si grands et poussés par des vents violents, sont cependant tournés avec un très petit gouvernail, là où le gouverneur le veut.\nDe même la langue est un petit membre et se vante de grandes choses. Voyez, quelle grande chose allume un petit feu !\nEt la langue est un feu, un monde d'iniquité, ainsi est la langue parmi nos membres, qu'elle souille tout le corps, et met le feu au cours de la nature ; et il est mis le feu de l'enfer .''  **\nLa seule histoire donnée dans les Écritures pour quelqu'un qui a été retrouvé vivant en enfer et enregistrée est le tourment de la langue. Il n'a pas parlé de l'œil, il n'a pas parlé de la bouche, et il n'a même pas parlé de la partie intime de cet homme qui a dû commettre beaucoup d'immoralités à part la langue !\nIl parle de la langue qui passait à travers le feu de Dieu ; le feu de l'enfer. L'homme riche en enfer a dit; \"Envoie Lazare pour qu'il plonge juste un bout d'eau avec son doigt et refroidisse ma langue\". Les yeux n'étaient-ils pas brûlants ? La narine consommée; les oreilles, la partie intime et les cheveux de la tête brûlent ? Mais la langue !\nEt Dieu dit, Il est capable de vous sauver au point où vous n'offenserez pas avec votre langue. C'est possible? Notre Dieu est capable et par son intercession et sa grâce, cela va fonctionner. Cela fonctionnera pour nous. Il vous amènera à ce point où vous n'offensez pas avec votre langue. Que le Seigneur le fasse pour votre vie. Amen.  **\n \nLa pureté et les oreilles   **\nFaites attention à ce que vous entendez. Le poids d'un porteur de contes fait un grand mal. Détourne-toi de l'homme insensé quand tu n'aperçois pas en lui les lèvres de la connaissance. Soyez prudent car ce que vous entendez peut vous provoquer à de mauvaises actions. Par conséquent, vérifiez bien le rapport. Vérifiez qui rapporte qu'ils ne souillent pas votre action et ne souillent pas votre vie parce que ce que quelqu'un peut vous dire d'un autre peut transformer votre cœur aimant en haine contre cette personne.  **\n \nPureté dans le monde   **\nJacques 1 verset 27   **\n\" La religion pure et sans souillure devant Dieu et le Père consiste à visiter les orphelins et les veuves dans leur affliction, et à se garder sans souillure du monde. \"  **\nÊtre sans tache du monde et des activités du monde comme l'amour du monde ; association et amitié avec le monde. Vous devez faire attention où vous travaillez. Dans ce bureau, ne laissez pas les activités du monde vous submerger. Veillez à ne pas vous laisser envahir par l'amour de l'argent, racine de tous les maux.  **\n\nLa pureté et les beautés du monde   **\nLe monde est un monde de beauté. Même les animaux sont beaux. Les hommes et les femmes sont beaux. Faites très attention à ce que la beauté du monde ne vous emporte pas. Vous n'allez pas convoiter la beauté. La Bible dit que la faveur est trompeuse et que la beauté est vaine. La beauté est vanité. N'y mettez pas votre cœur. Argent   Lorsque les richesses augmentent, n'y mettez pas votre cœur. Donc sois prudent. Gardez-vous pur. N'entrez pas dans une mauvaise action parce que vous avez besoin d'argent.  **\n \nChapitre Quatre   Passion pour la Pureté des autres.   **\n \nDans la passion de la pureté des autres, nous voulons la pureté des autres.  **\nPsaumes 12 verset 1    **\n« Au secours, Seigneur ; car l'homme pieux cesse; car les fidèles manquent parmi les enfants des hommes .  **\nPouvez-vous voir cet homme? C'est un homme passionné qui fait appel à la pureté des autres. La pureté de Dieu est défaillante dans l'église. Vous ne pouvez plus trouver la sainteté dans l'église. L'homme pieux cesse . Je vois la corruption entrer dans l'église, entrer dans les gens et entrer dans la piété. Les gens tombent. Les gens sont corrompus. Allez dans les églises et voyez comment les gens dansent. Quand on voit les danses corrompues qui sont dans les églises ; nous tenons alors notre estomac comme une femme en travail.\nLa justice de Dieu est partie. L'homme pieux a cessé. Pouvez-vous faire ces choses que vous faites et être encore saint ? Non! Ce n'est pas possible! Les deux ne peuvent pas aller ensemble. La fierté est entrée dans votre corps. Maintenant, l'attention est dans la manifestation corporelle. Les tambours ont repris les paroles des chansons. Vous n'entendez même plus les paroles des chansons. Les gens qui jouent de la batterie n'ont pas Dieu à l'esprit. Ils vous ont, comment vous divertir, comment bouger votre corps, c'est ce qu'ils pensent. L'homme pieux crie que la justice est morte ici. Aidez Dieu, car l'homme pieux cesse; car les fidèles manquent parmi les enfants des hommes. Quand nous venons d'entendre des histoires sur certains de ces pasteurs, l'immoralité qu'ils commettent dans leurs églises, la corruption, le démonisme employé dans les ministères, nous pleurons. La piété a cessé. Nous pleurons; Dieu restaure la sainteté; restaurer la pureté de votre peuple. C'est notre prière et c'est notre cri. Quand nous voyons la façon dont les gens font preuve de zèle dans de mauvaises parures, faisant preuve de zèle pour Dieu, de zèle pour l'évangélisation, nous pleurons. Seigneur lève-toi. Quelque chose est en train de se passer.  **\nLes gens volent de la crème sans prendre de bain. Jour après jour, ils n'ont pas pris de bain ; ils ne font que voler de la crème. Ce n'est ni l'hygiène ni la propreté. Aide Seigneur car l'homme pieux cesse. Le fidèle échoue.\nNous regardons d'église en église. Une dame en particulier a dit, dans une révélation divine, le Seigneur l'a emmenée d'église en église, et dans une grande église pour voir combien de justes il y avait ? Deux 2 Trois 3 ! Qu'est-il arrivé aux autres ? L'homme pieux cesse. Quand vous allez dans un endroit et que vous trouvez vingt personnes pieuse, au moment où vous venez demain, cinq sont sorties parmi celles qui restent quinze. Aide Seigneur. L'homme pieux cesse . Les fidèles cessent. Ils sont trop peu nombreux parmi les hommes dans la société. Le diable engloutit ces gens. L'ennemi avance. Il capture des villes et des cités et se rapproche du quartier général. Nous crions pour la pureté dans l'église.  **\nRomains 10 versets 1 à 3    **\n« Frères, le désir et la prière de mon cœur à Dieu pour Israël est qu'ils soient sauvés.\nCar je leur rends témoignage qu'ils ont du zèle pour Dieu, mais pas selon la connaissance.\nCar ignorant la justice de Dieu, et cherchant à établir leur propre justice, ils ne se sont pas soumis à la justice de Dieu \".  **\n  \nMon désir du cœur et ma prière à Dieu est la passion pour la pureté des autres. C'est votre préoccupation pour le salut des autres et de ces autres ministres qui partent en mission dans les pays étrangers mais y commettent des immoralités. Ils empruntent de l'argent et ne remboursent jamais. Seuls les méchants empruntent et ne remboursent plus. Ils racontent des mensonges et falsifient des dossiers. si vous leur demandez combien de personnes ils ont gagnées, ils répondront trois cents alors qu'ils n'ont obtenu que quatre personnes . La justice a cessé. Mon cri est qu'ils ont du zèle pour Dieu mais pas selon la connaissance. Ils ignorent la justice de Christ. Ils pensent que souffrir comme aller dans la forêt, faire un don pour l'œuvre de Dieu et faire beaucoup de bonnes œuvres rend pur et saint. La Bible dit que, bien que vous vous donniez pour être brûlés et que vous n'ayez aucune charité, cela ne vous a servi à rien . 1 Corinthiens 13 verset 3 . Si je donne même en service, en sacrifice, en donnant; mais pas de sainteté, de pureté et de justice, cela ne me profite en rien. Pourtant, de grands travaux sont en cours.\nUn homme peut édifier une église entière sans qu'il y ait de justice en lui. Il a la deuxième femme avec lui. O Seigneur, je pleure. Le désir de mon cœur est que ces églises parviennent à la connaissance de la vérité. Sinon, les méchants seront renvoyés en enfer et toutes les églises qui oublient Dieu. Toutes les églises qui ne connaissent pas Sa Sainteté seront transformées en enfer.  **\nIls ont bien commencé, ont bien enseigné ces gens mais finalement, la corruption est entrée dedans et ils ont perdu leur récompense. Leur justice ne sera jamais rappelée. Leurs services ne seront jamais rappelés. Tous les sacrifices, la persécution auxquels ils sont confrontés dans la vie ne seront jamais rappelés. A cause de l'iniquité qu'ils ont laissée entrer dans leur assemblée, c'est pour cette iniquité qu'ils mourront. Prenez toutes les mesures nécessaires pour les récupérer. Prenez toutes les mesures nécessaires pour les récupérer car Dieu ne fait acception de personne. Quand Moïse a fait une chose qui ne méritait pas d'entrer dans la Terre Promise, Dieu a dit à Moïse « tu n'y entres pas ». Dieu ne fait pas acception de personnes. Et la Bible dit « mieux vaut la fin d'une chose que son commencement » ( Ecclésiaste 7 verset 8 ). Pourquoi ces hommes finissent-ils ainsi ? Pourquoi cette église glorieuse se termine-t-elle ainsi ? Et la fin vaut mieux que le début. Toute l'histoire que vous avez faite. Tous les disques que vous avez faits deviendront vanité. C'est pourquoi nous luttons passionnément pour rendre les autres justes, les récupérer et les ramener à la vérité.  **\nRomains 9 versets 1 à 4 montre que ces personnes ont l'Écriture. Ce ne sont pas des gens d'autres religions. Ils ne sont pas païens et ils ne sont pas musulmans. Ils ont l'Écriture, ils sont arrivés au point où ils peuvent lire. Ils ont des écoles de théologie. Que leur est-il arrivé, pourquoi sont-ils devenus si ignorants ?\nQuand je me couche, je halète. Ce qui se produit? Pourquoi êtes-vous arrivé à ce point et pourtant vous ne pouvez pas avoir cette compréhension ; obtenez-vous ces connaissances pour perfectionner votre travail de présentation ? Comment présenter à Dieu ce qui n'est pas parfait ? Afin qu'il puisse se présenter une église glorieuse sans tache ni ride. Votre tissu est déjà en bon état, mais il y a quelque chose qui doit juste être enlevé. Vous ne pouvez pas être présenté à Dieu. Je me sens mal. Pour cette raison, je souhaite que je sois moi-même maudit, qu'ils entrent . Qu'est-ce qui les a amenés à cet aveuglement ? Nous leur souhaitons; nous travaillons, jeûnons et prions Dieu de leur ouvrir les yeux.\nÉlisée a prié pour son serviteur et Dieu lui a ouvert les yeux afin qu'il puisse voir l'armée des anges afin qu'il cesse d'avoir peur. Et le Seigneur ouvrit les yeux du serviteur et quand il vit qu'en effet la divinité était autour d'eux, il se tut. Que Dieu leur ouvre les yeux. C'est la prière que nous prions. C'est la passion pour la pureté des autres.  **\nOn ne peut même pas parler de ces autres qui sont allés dans d'autres religions ; les musulmans et les autres qui sont complètement à l'écart. Nous pouvons parler des adorateurs d'idoles autour de nous et de nos relations. Que faisons-nous pour qu'ils viennent parce qu'il n'y a pas d'autre moyen ? Jésus est le chemin, le seul chemin. Il n'y a aucun autre nom donné sous le ciel ou parmi les hommes pour que nous soyons sauvés. Nous pensons aux perdus, devrions-nous penser à vous, qui avez déjà la Bible ? Vous qui pouvez lire la Bible? Qui a l'esprit de penser ? Qui a obtenu le salut? Juste pour que vous embrassiez la Sainteté, le perfectionnement et la purification de votre vie ; pour que tu puisses être présentable à Dieu et que tu te disputes, tu es ignorant? pourtant tu avances. Vous ne ferez pas le paradis. Vous n'allez pas y entrer. Le ciel est pour les chrétiens saints et parfaits. Oui , c'est une véritable passion pour la pureté des autres.  **\nColossiens 1 verset 28 à 29     **\n« Lequel nous prêchons, avertissant tout homme et enseignant tout homme en toute sagesse ; afin que nous puissions présenter tout homme parfait en Jésus-Christ;\nA quoi je travaille aussi, m'efforçant selon son œuvre, qui agit puissamment en moi .  **\n Pouvez-vous Le voir travailler? Il travaille puissamment en moi. Je me repose. Je travaille. Quel est mon travail de prédication et d'avertissement ? Pourquoi? La raison en est que nous pouvons présenter tout homme parfait en Jésus-Christ. C'est ce que nous faisons; nous voulons perfectionner les gens. Il y a de l'agitation en nous. Il y a une passion en nous.\nNous pensons comment faire savoir aux catholiques que cette prière de Je vous salue Marie est l'affaire de l'enfer ? Comment leur faire savoir? Comment pouvons-nous faire en sorte que PFN sache que tous les cultes sales de sauter et de chanter n'ont aucune droiture en eux ? Comment faire en sorte que l'église vêtue de blanc sache qu'elle a besoin de connaître Jésus ? Cela se fait en leur disant qu'ils doivent enlever toutes ces choses et être remplis du Saint-Esprit et servir ce Dieu saintement et justement à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur. Comment faire savoir à ces ministres qu'ils ont besoin de se purifier et d'ajouter l'Evangile de sainteté ? C'est en leur faisant savoir que l'Evangile de la pureté est prêché pour amener leurs membres à être purifiés, saints et justes. La parure doit être divine, les bijoux doivent être enlevés. La mondanité, la permanente, l'attachement doivent être éliminés. Ils devraient prêcher cet Evangile. Nous travaillons avec passion. Nous travaillons; sinon il n'y a pas d'héritage céleste.  **\nUne femme a hérité du ministère de sa mère donné par Dieu. La mère était une prophétesse et était décédée en décembre 2012. Le directeur international du mouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde a été invité par la fille qui a succédé à la mère après son enterrement à l'âge de 90 ans. La fille de cette femme a appris à prêcher la sainteté. de lui. Elle a appris à enlever les boucles d'oreilles, les bijoux, les attaches, etc., lorsqu'elle a reçu et lu les livres du directeur international et que ses yeux se sont ouverts. La mère était prophétesse depuis 56 ans. Lorsque la fille a reçu ce message selon l'histoire, ils ont un camp de prière qui est une très grande place. Ils l'ont construit et ont des foules de gens là-bas.\nLa mère rassemblait toujours les gens pour le programme et des miracles avaient été faits par la mère. Quand elle les a rassemblés comme cela et a prêché au peuple; la fille prenait le micro et leur disait qu'avec toutes ces choses que ma mère vous avait dites, si elle ne retirait pas les boucles d'oreille de son oreille, elle n'irait pas au ciel. La mère allait l'entendre. Si vous n'enleviez pas cet anneau dans votre main, chaîne sur votre cou, attache, tissage, etc., vous n'alliez pas au paradis. Avec toutes ces choses, ma mère vous disait les gens; si elle n'enlevait pas tous ces bijoux, elle ne verrait pas le ciel. À la fin, la mère a écouté sa fille et les a tous enlevés et est devenue propre. Peu de temps après, elle est décédée.\nUne révélation claire l'a montrée au paradis. Le Seigneur a également parlé par l'intermédiaire d'une des sœurs et a dit que vous étiez maintenant l'instrument qui a permis à votre mère de créer le ciel. Ta mère est maintenant au paradis. Quelqu'un a également eu une vision que cette femme est au paradis et qui a dit que c'était ma fille, ils l'ont vue avec un vêtement ou un vêtement blanc. Elle a dit que ma fille m'avait donné ça. Ma fille m'a permis d'être ici. Elle l'a prêché avec passion. Autre; les 56 années de travail de la mère auraient été un gâchis. Beaucoup de choses se perdent à notre époque. De nombreux travaux sont gaspillés, sauf s'ils sont perfectionnés. Combien faut-il pour enlever les bagues, les boucles d'oreilles, les alliances, les bagues de fiançailles, la chaîne, l'attachement, la peinture et la coiffure impie ?\nRien!\nVous êtes déjà chrétien. Dieu entend vos prières et d'autres sont guéris. Oui, à cause du service. Mais pour votre vie, vous n'y irez pas car rien de ce qui souille n'y entrera. Alors, c'est la passion; passion pour la pureté en Christ. Ayez la passion de votre pureté personnelle. Ayez la passion de la pureté des autres. Travaillez, travaillez et retrouvez-vous au paradis. Que Dieu te bénisse.\n\n",

      "body": "LE PORTRAIT D'UNE FEMME SAINTE ET PASSIONNÉE   **\n\nPRÉSENTATION   **\nLuc. 1 verset 26 à 38   **\n26 Et le sixième mois, l'ange Gabriel fut envoyé par Dieu dans une ville de Galilée, nommée Nazareth,\n27 A une vierge fiancée à un homme nommé Joseph, de la maison de David; et le nom de la vierge était Marie.\n28 Et l'ange vint vers elle, et lui dit   Je te salue, toi qui es hautement favorisée , le Seigneur est avec toi, tu es bénie entre les femmes. 29 Et lorsqu'elle le vit, elle fut troublée par ses paroles, et se demanda quelle sorte de salut cela devait être.\n30 Et l'ange lui dit   Ne crains pas, Marie, car tu as trouvé grâce auprès de Dieu. 31 Et voici, tu concevras dans ton sein, et tu enfanteras un fils, et tu appelleras son nom JÉSUS.\n32 Il sera grand et sera appelé le Fils du Très-Haut ; et le Seigneur Dieu lui donnera le trône de David, son père.\n33 Et il régnera sur la maison de Jacob pour toujours ; et de son royaume il n'y aura pas de fin. 34 Alors Marie dit à l'ange   Comment cela se fera-t-il, puisque je ne connais pas d'homme ?\n35 Et l'ange répondit et lui dit  Le Saint-Esprit viendra sur toi, et la puissance du Très-Haut te couvrira de son ombre, c'est pourquoi aussi cette chose sainte qui naîtra de toi sera appelée Fils de Dieu.\n36 Et voici, ta cousine Elisabeth, elle a aussi conçu un fils dans sa vieillesse, et c'est le sixième mois avec elle, qui était appelée stérile.\n37 Car rien n'est impossible à Dieu. 38 Et Marie dit   Voici la servante du Seigneur ; qu'il me soit fait selon ta parole. Et l'ange la quitta.  **\nPar ce livre, Dieu vous accordera la grâce de connaître et de comprendre Marie. Aura besoin de savoir sur elle en tant que séparé. C'est parce que SON Fils, Jésus-Christ et comprend à son sujet parce que son Fils, Jésus-Christ, était si grand et l'a tellement ombragée que beaucoup ne considèrent pas ou ne se souviennent pas des qualités de la femme appelée Marie. Même si toute notre attention dans la vie est tournée vers le Seigneur Jésus, qui est en réalité ce qui compte, nous devons également savoir qu'il y a des choses à apprendre des personnages bibliques et des saints d'autrefois. Certains, qui sont pour Jésus, oublient complètement Marie. Certains pensent même que Marie aurait pu être pécheresse au moment où le choix de Dieu s'est présenté à elle, lorsque l'ange lui est apparu. Marie était une sainte à cette époque, pas une pécheresse. Elle était pieuse et juste.   **\n Luc 1 verset 46 à 50   **\n46 Et Marie dit   Mon âme magnifie le Seigneur, 47 Et mon esprit se réjouit en Dieu mon Sauveur . 48 Car il a regardé le bas état de sa servante; car voici, désormais toutes les générations me diront bienheureuse.\n49 Car celui qui est puissant m'a fait de grandes choses; et saint est son nom. 50 Et sa miséricorde est sur ceux qui le craignent de génération en génération.\n51 Il a montré la force de son bras; Il a dispersé les orgueilleux dans l'imagination de leur cœur. 52 Il a renversé les puissants de leurs sièges, et les a élevés à un bas degré. 53 Il a rassasié de bonnes choses les affamés; et les riches, il les a renvoyés à vide.\n54 Il a secouru son serviteur Israël, en souvenir de sa miséricorde; 55 Comme il l'a dit à nos pères, à Abraham et à sa postérité pour toujours.\n56 Et Marie demeura avec elle environ trois mois, et retourna dans sa maison.  **\nD'un autre côté, certaines personnes vont diaboliquement loin. Les païens et les idolâtres qui adorent les déesses transforment Marie en déesse et oublient la personne principale   Jésus-Christ. Ils l'appellent \"La Mère de Dieu\". Ceux-là le font par esprit de paganisme et d'idolâtrie. Il est regrettable que la majeure partie de l'église appartienne aujourd'hui à ce culte idolâtre de Marie.  **\nActes 10 verset 25 à 26   **\n25 Et comme Pierre entrait, Corneille le rencontra, se prosterna à ses pieds et se prosterna devant lui.\n26 Mais Pierre le fit monter, en disant   Lève- toi ; Moi aussi je suis un homme. Ils assimilent Marie à Dieu et la voient plus grande que tous les êtres humains, car elle a été choisie pour donner naissance à Jésus.  **\nActes 14 verset 8 à 17   **\n8 Et il était assis à Lystre un certain homme, impuissant de ses pieds, infirme depuis le sein de sa mère, qui n'avait jamais marché .\n10 Dit d'une voix forte   Tenez-vous debout sur vos pieds. Et il sauta et marcha.\n11 Et quand le peuple vit ce que Paul avait fait, il éleva la voix, disant dans le discours de Lycaonie   Les dieux sont descendus jusqu'à nous à la ressemblance des hommes.\n12 Et ils appelèrent Barnabas Jupiter; et Paul, Mercurius, parce qu'il était le principal orateur.\n13 Alors le sacrificateur de Jupiter, qui était devant leur ville, amena des boeufs et des guirlandes aux portes, et aurait sacrifié avec le peuple. 14 Lorsque les apôtres Barnabas et Paul entendirent parler, ils déchirent leurs vêtements et coururent parmi le peuple en criant  \n15 Et disant   Messieurs, pourquoi faites-vous ces choses ? Nous sommes aussi des hommes de passions similaires avec vous, et vous prêchons que vous devriez vous détourner de ces vanités vers le Dieu vivant, qui a fait le ciel, et la terre, et la mer, et tout ce qui s'y trouve  \n16 qui, dans les temps passés, a permis à toutes les nations de marcher dans leurs propres voies.\n17 Néanmoins, il ne s'est pas laissé sans témoin, en ce qu'il a fait du bien, et nous a donné la pluie du ciel, et des saisons fructueuses, remplissant nos cœurs de nourriture et de joie.  **\nMaintenant, nous pouvons voir les deux côtés de la médaille. Ce livre cherchera à se concentrer sur Marie avec un message particulier à chaque femme chrétienne. Quelles qualités de vie Marie, la femme qui a été choisie pour donner naissance à Jésus, avait-elle ? Dieu est-il négligent dans son choix ? Y a-t-il des choses à imiter dans la vie de Marie ? Vous verrez dans ce livre que Marie, la mère de Jésus, était aussi humaine que n'importe quelle autre personne sur terre. Elle n'était pas un être humain supplémentaire comme certains le pensaient à tort. En fait, la Bible la désigne comme la mère de la foi. La Bible a exalté Sarah, la femme d'Abraham, comme la mère de la foi que toutes les femmes, y compris Marie, devaient imiter.  **\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 3 à 6   **\n3 À qui n'est-ce pas la parure extérieure de tresser les cheveux, et de porter de l'or, ou de se vêtir ?\n4 Mais que ce soit l'homme caché du cœur, dans ce qui n'est pas corruptible, même l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille, qui est de grand prix aux yeux de Dieu.\n5 Car c'est ainsi qu'autrefois les saintes femmes, qui se confiaient en Dieu, se paraient elles-mêmes, étant soumises à leurs propres maris  \n6 De même que Sara obéit à Abraham, l'appelant seigneur, dont vous êtes les filles, pourvu que vous agissiez bien et que vous ne craigniez aucun étonnement.  **\nC'était le choix de Dieu de faire prévaloir Marie et non Joseph, le mari, par conséquent, l'Écriture n'a pas donné beaucoup de récit sur Joseph son mari. L'Écriture a suffisamment décrit sa sainteté, sa vision pieuse, sa passion pour Dieu et son industrie dans la formation des enfants. Dieu attend de toutes les femmes qu'elles aient un caractère saint, qu'elles s'habillent et soient au service de Dieu et qu'elles se soumettent à leur mari dans la volonté de Dieu.  **\n\nCHAPITRE UN   **\nQUALITÉS DIEUSES EN MARIE   **\n1.1 Qui était Marie ?  **\nLuc. 1 verset 28   **\n28 Et l'ange vint vers elle, et lui dit   Je te salue, toi qui es hautement favorisée , le Seigneur est avec toi ; tu es bénie entre les femmes.  **\nMarie, la mère de Jésus selon la chair, était considérée comme une femme hautement favorisée ; une bienheureuse entre les femmes. Cette salutation ne la décrit pas comme la meilleure ou la plus grande femme parmi les femmes de la terre. Cependant, cela a montré qu'elle possédait de bonnes qualités de vie qui l'ont adaptée au choix de Dieu et à l'appel qu'elle a reçu. Ce sont des qualités que toute femme vertueuse devrait imiter. Vos yeux s'ouvriront en lisant ce livre. Il est temps pour le réveil de la fin des temps et le Seigneur veut que des femmes de ces qualités se lèvent parmi ses filles. Il veut des femmes qui pourront présenter au monde ce que Marie a présenté au monde   Jésus a été le sauveur du monde. Sachez que Jésus avait existé en tant que Dieu créateur de toutes choses et de toutes, y compris Marie. En tant qu'enfants d'Adam, les parents de Marie sont nés dans le péché. Ils l'ont conçue dans le péché et l'ont enfantée comme une pécheresse comme chaque enfant d'Adam. En tant que pécheresse, elle avait besoin du salut de Dieu de son péché. Elle a fait confiance à Dieu qui l'a sauvée et l'a rendue juste. Dieu est le sauveur de tous ceux qui l'invoquent. L'examen scripturaire montre que Marie possédait les qualités suivantes     **\n1.2 Elle a été rendue juste par Dieu.  **\nMarie a été sauvée du péché et rendue juste. Dieu était son Seigneur et Sauveur . Elle a marché avec Dieu dans la justice.  **\nLuc. 1 verset 46, 47   **\n46 Et Marie dit   Mon âme magnifie le Seigneur, 47 Et mon esprit se réjouit en Dieu mon Sauveur .  **\nMarie connaissait le Seigneur. Avant que l'ange ne la rencontre, elle était une femme qui servait Dieu dans la justice. Ce n'était pas un choix négligent   la femme qui a donné naissance à Jésus n'était pas une femme négligente. Elle n'était pas une pécheresse.  **\n1.3 Elle était sainte, pure et propre   **\nElle a maintenu la pureté et la sainteté dans le cœur et dans la vie. Le récit scripturaire sur elle avant sa visite à l'ange en atteste.  **\nLuc. 1 verset 26, 27, 34   **\n26 Et le sixième mois, l'ange Gabriel fut envoyé par Dieu dans une ville de Galilée, nommée Nazareth,\n27 A une vierge fiancée à un homme nommé Joseph, de la maison de David; et le nom de la vierge était Marie.\n34 Alors Marie dit à l'ange   Comment cela se fera-t-il, puisque je ne connais pas d'homme ?  **\nMarie a gardé la virginité. Elle n'était pas une femme négligente exposée à l'immoralité. Elle n'était pas négligemment exposée aux jeunes hommes, pas même à celui qui se proposait de l'épouser. Elle n'était pas du genre à inciter son fiancé à coucher avec elle. Jamais! Elle n'était pas le genre que son fiancé touchait, la pressait et s'allongeait avec elle sur le lit. C'était une femme propre. C'est le vase que Dieu utilise ! Le vase que Dieu utilise est un vase d' honneur . Marie était un vase d' honneur . Quand l'ange la vit, il cria pour la saluer parce qu'elle s'était maintenue dans les voies de Dieu et dans sa justice.  **\n2 Timothée 2 verset 19 à 21   **\n19 Néanmoins, le fondement de Dieu demeure assuré, ayant ce sceau   le Seigneur connaît ceux qui sont à lui. Et, Que quiconque nomme le nom de Christ s'éloigne de l'iniquité.\n20 Mais dans une grande maison, il n'y a pas seulement des vases d'or et d'argent, mais aussi de bois et de terre ; et certains à honorer , et certains à déshonorer .\n21 Si donc un homme se purifie de ceux-ci, il sera un vase d' honneur , sanctifié, propre à l'usage du maître, et préparé à toute bonne œuvre.  **\nL'Ange a dit   « Le Seigneur est avec vous ! C'est parce que le Seigneur est avec les justes, les pieux et les saints. Marie, dans sa justice et sa sainteté, a attiré l'attention de Dieu et ainsi le Seigneur a apporté une faveur spéciale à sa vie. Tout au long des générations jusqu'à présent, les catholiques qui adorent Marie maintiennent un portrait des vêtements et des parures de Marie dépourvus de bijoux. J'ai entendu parler d'une occasion où quelqu'un a fait un portrait de Marie portant des bijoux et les catholiques se sont déchaînés dans le monde entier contre cela. C'est parce que les femmes pieuses des temps bibliques n'utilisaient jamais de bijoux ou d'autres ornements impies.  **\nPremier Pierre 3 verset 3 à 5   **\n3 À qui n'est-ce pas la parure extérieure de tresser les cheveux, et de porter de l'or, ou de se vêtir ? 4 Mais que ce soit l'homme caché du cœur, dans ce qui n'est pas corruptible, même l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille, qui est de grand prix aux yeux de Dieu.\n5 Car de cette manière dans les temps anciens aussi les saintes femmes, qui se confiaient en Dieu, se paraient elles-mêmes, étant soumises à leurs propres maris     **\n1.4 Elle était une femme de foi en Dieu   **\nLuc. 1 verset 38, 45   **\n38 Et Marie dit   Voici la servante du Seigneur ; qu'il me soit fait selon ta parole. Et l'ange la quitta.\n45 Et bienheureuse celle qui a cru, car il y aura accomplissement des choses qui lui ont été dites de la part du Seigneur.  **\nPouvez-vous voir la différence entre Marie et Zacharie, le prêtre ? Tous deux ont eu des visites angéliques et une promesse venue de Dieu. Mais l'un doutait et l'autre croyait Dieu.  **\nVoici comment cela s'est passé avec Zacharias.  **\nLuc. 1 verset 11 à 13, 18 à 20   **\n11 Et un ange du Seigneur lui apparut, debout à droite de l'autel des parfums.\n12 Et quand Zacharie le vit, il fut troublé, et la peur tomba sur lui. 13 Mais l'ange lui dit   N'aie pas peur, Zacharie ; car ta prière est exaucée; et ta femme Elisabeth t'enfantera un fils, et tu appelleras son nom Jean.\n18 Et Zacharie dit à l'ange, par quoi connaîtrai-je cela ? Car je suis un vieil homme, et ma femme est bien atteinte d'âge.\n19 Et l'ange, répondant, lui dit   Je suis Gabriel, qui me tiens devant Dieu ; et je suis envoyé pour te parler et t'annoncer ces bonnes nouvelles.\n20 Et voici, tu seras muet, et tu ne pourras parler, jusqu'au jour où ces choses seront accomplies, parce que tu ne crois pas à mes paroles, qui s'accompliront en leur temps.  **\nLorsque l'ange lui a dit que sa femme donnerait naissance à un fils et qu'il appellerait l'enfant du nom de Jean, Zacharie a douté dans son cœur. Zacharias avait une femme et en tant que tel, la conception pouvait facilement se produire, mais il doutait. Par conséquent, l'ange a déclaré qu'il serait muet jusqu'à l'accomplissement. Mais voyez la différence avec Marie. Elle n'avait pas de mari et ne couchait avec personne. Lorsque l'ange lui a dit ce qui était plus difficile, elle a seulement demandé comment cela se passerait compte tenu de son état civil. Et au moment où l'ange lui a dit que ce serait un acte de Dieu; elle céda et crut. Que chaque femme croie la parole et les promesses de Dieu.  **\nJean 11 verset 39, 40, 43, 44.  **\n39 Jésus dit   Otez la pierre. Marthe, la soeur de celui qui était mort, lui dit  Seigneur, il pue maintenant , car il est mort depuis quatre jours.\n40 Jésus lui dit   Ne t'ai-je pas dit que, si tu croyais , tu verrais la gloire de Dieu ? 43 Et ayant ainsi parlé, il cria d'une voix forte   Lazare, sors.\n44 Et celui qui était mort sortit, pieds et poings liés, avec des draps ; et son visage était enveloppé d'une serviette. Jésus leur dit   Déliez- le, et laissez-le aller.  **\nLe Seigneur vous a appelé à être un croyant, pas un sceptique. Croyez ce que Dieu vous dit. C'est ainsi que Marie s'est comportée. Rappelez-vous, dans le premier miracle de Jésus, quand les gens voulaient du vin. Elle est venue à Jésus et avec une pleine foi en lui et a dit  \"Ils n'ont pas de vin.\" Les gens que Dieu utilise étaient des gens de foi, car sans la foi, il est impossible de plaire à Dieu… celui qui vient à Dieu doit croire… ( Héb. 11 6) Puis elle retourna vers les disciples et dit   « Tout ce qu'il dit à Tu le fais.\" C'est une femme de foi. Vous qui êtes plein de plaintes et de doutes, vous ne pouvez pas plaire à Dieu. Pour être un vase d' honneur , vous devez être une femme de foi. Regardez ce qui a été dit de cette femme de foi     **\nLuc. 1 verset 39 à 45   **\n39 Et Marie se leva en ces jours-là, et s'en alla en hâte dans la montagne, dans une ville de Juda ; 40 Et entra dans la maison de Zacharie, et salua Elisabeth.\n41 Et il arriva que, lorsqu'Elisabeth entendit le salut de Marie, l'enfant tressaillit dans son ventre ; et Elisabeth fut remplie du Saint-Esprit  \n42 Et elle parla d'une voix forte, et dit   Tu es bénie entre les femmes, et béni est le fruit de ton sein. 43 Et d'où m'importe que la mère de mon Seigneur vienne à moi ?\n44 Car voici, dès que la voix de ta salutation a retenti à mes oreilles, le bébé a sauté de joie dans mon ventre.\n45 Et bienheureuse celle qui a cru, car il y aura accomplissement des choses qui lui ont été dites de la part du Seigneur.  **\n'Il y aura une performance'  Cela signifie qu'à ce moment, la grossesse n'était pas encore venue, mais par la foi, puisque Dieu avait parlé, elle viendrait. \"Shall be\" signifie qu'il n'a pas encore été joué. Mais parce qu'elle avait cru, cela allait arriver. Existe-t-il des femmes de foi sur le modèle de Marie ? Y a-t-il des femmes qui croient que le Seigneur accomplira la chose pour laquelle elles prient ? Y a-t-il des gens qui croient que les promesses de Dieu qui ont été déversées sur eux s'accompliront dans leur vie ? Y a-t-il des gens qui croient que l'onction du Saint-Esprit viendra sur eux et que le Seigneur les transformera pour qu'ils deviennent des prédicateurs de cet évangile ? Y a-t-il des gens qui croient que le Seigneur les élèvera pour devenir des évangélistes, des missionnaires, des enseignants, des musiciens et faire d'autres œuvres plus grandes pour promouvoir cet évangile et répandre le réveil dans le monde entier ? Crois-tu? Si vous le faites, il y aura un spectacle !  **\nMarc 9 verset 23   **\nJésus lui dit   Si tu peux croire, tout est possible à celui qui croit.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 2 verset 13   **\nC'est pourquoi aussi nous rendons grâces à Dieu sans cesse, parce que, lorsque vous avez reçu la parole de Dieu que vous avez entendue de nous, vous ne l'avez pas reçue comme la parole des hommes, mais comme elle est en vérité, la parole de Dieu, qui agit efficacement. aussi en vous qui croyez.  **\nCroyez que ce que Dieu vous a dit s'accomplira.  **\n1.5 Elle était une humble femme de Dieu   **\nLa femme que le Seigneur a choisie était vraiment digne de marcher avec le Seigneur, parce qu'elle était d'un esprit humble et contrit.  **\nLuc. 1 verset 39 à 45   **\n39 Et Marie se leva en ces jours-là, et s'en alla en hâte dans la montagne, dans une ville de Juda ;\n40 Et entra dans la maison de Zacharie, et salua Elisabeth. 41 Et il arriva que, lorsqu'Elisabeth entendit le salut de Marie, l'enfant tressaillit dans son ventre ; et Elisabeth fut remplie du Saint-Esprit  \n42 Et elle parla d'une voix forte, et dit   Tu es bénie entre les femmes, et béni est le fruit de ton sein.\n43 Et d'où m'importe que la mère de mon Seigneur vienne à moi ?\n44 Car voici, dès que la voix de ta salutation a retenti à mes oreilles, le bébé a sauté de joie dans mon ventre.\n45 Et bienheureuse celle qui a cru, car il y aura accomplissement des choses qui lui ont été dites de la part du Seigneur.  **\nSi certaines de ces femmes ont aujourd'hui une telle exaltation et un tel don de grâce comme Marie, comment vont-elles se comporter ? Si Marie était comme certaines de ces épouses de pasteurs qui reçoivent la grâce d'être élevées à une position d'autorité ou investies de dons, ayant des femmes à ses ordres, elle serait humble. Elle se sentirait le moins parmi les femmes, mais beaucoup de femmes occupant des postes élevés marchent comme si elles étaient suspendues dans les airs. \"Je suis une grande femme\". C'est le comportement de certaines personnes, mais pas de Mary. Elle était très humble. La promesse de Dieu n'a jamais changé son caractère ni l'a promue au-dessus de son mari. Elle allait encore être soumise à son mari. Les dons et les appels de Dieu ne devraient pas être pour votre orgueil. Ne levez jamais l'épaule si le Seigneur vous amène à diriger les femmes. Ne vous exaltez jamais dans votre cœur au-dessus des autres, c'est un style de vie que Dieu déteste ! Un regard fier est une abomination pour le Seigneur. Que vous vous asseyiez dans l'église avec l'air d'autorité, en disant « je suis grande » femme, je suis la femme leader ici, je suis la femme du pasteur » Ce n'était pas qui était Mary ! Oh Seigneur, change ces sœurs et fais en sorte qu'elles soient comme Marie. Mon Dieu, mettez l'esprit de Marie sur ces femmes. Oh Dieu, aide leurs cœurs à être humbles dans leurs églises, états et nations. Où que vous soyez, que la brisure et l'humilité de Marie possèdent votre vie oh fille de Dieu !\nLes dons et l'appel de Dieu ne doivent pas vous rendre fier et autoritaire. Vous devez faire preuve d'humilité. Voyez ce que Jésus a dit.  **\nMatthieu 23 verset 11   **\n11 Mais celui qui est le plus grand parmi vous sera votre serviteur. C'est le cœur que vous devez posséder.  **\nPhilippiens 2 verset 5 à 8   **\n5 Que cette pensée soit en vous, qui était aussi en Jésus-Christ   6 Lui qui, étant sous la forme de Dieu, n'a pas pensé que ce n'était pas un vol d'être égal à Dieu  \n7 Mais il s'est fait sans réputation, et a pris sur lui la forme d'un serviteur, et a été fait à la ressemblance des hommes.\n8 Et étant trouvé à la mode en tant qu'homme, il s'est humilié et est devenu obéissant jusqu'à la mort, même la mort de la croix. Dieu dit, humilie-toi - c'était le caractère de Marie - alors je t'exalterai.  **\nPremier Pierre 5 verset 6   **\n6 Humiliez-vous donc sous la main puissante de Dieu, afin qu'il vous élève en temps voulu  \n15 Nous verrons plus de qualités d'humilité dans la vie de Marie dans l'Ecriture suivante.  **\nLuc 2 verset 6, 7   **\n6 Et c'est ainsi que, pendant qu'ils étaient là, les jours étaient accomplis pour qu'elle soit délivrée.\n7Et elle enfanta son fils premier-ne, et l'enveloppa de langes, et le coucha dans une mangeoire; car il n'y avait pas de place pour eux dans l'auberge.  **\nCommencez à adorer Dieu et remerciez Dieu pour la femme appelée Marie. C'est génial et merveilleux ! C'est ce que Dieu veut mettre dans votre cœur et dans votre vie. Pouvez-vous voir que la femme à qui on avait promis qu'elle donnerait naissance au Très-Haut est arrivée à Bethléem à peu près au moment de l'accouchement et qu'il n'y avait pas de place pour eux parce que les chambres d'hôtel étaient pleines ? Le Seigneur veut vous accompagner vers le lieu de l'humilité. Le Seigneur veut que vous vous humiliiez car si vous êtes conscient de l'orgueil de ce monde, vous n'arriverez jamais là où Il veut vous emmener. Si vous êtes conscient de votre personnalité ou si vous attachez une gloire terrestre à votre vie, vous n'atteindrez jamais la place de Dieu. Le Seigneur prenait la place la plus basse de l'univers, la place la plus basse de la terre ! Il allait naître dans la maison des bêtes où l'on gardait les moutons. Il allait être déposé dans la mangeoire utilisée pour nourrir ces animaux. Le Seigneur a voulu descendre jusqu'à ce point d'humilité parce qu'Il venait briser l'orgueil du monde. Et Il avait besoin d'une femme qui coopérerait et irait avec Lui jusqu'à la profondeur de l'humilité. Où est cette femme aujourd'hui que le Seigneur amènera à la profondeur de l'humilité ? La profondeur de l'humilité   toute gloire disparue, toute grandeur disparue, toute cette grandeur et cette puissance en toi, mortes ! Je vous le dis sûrement, aucune femme lisant ce livre n'aurait jamais pu mettre son enfant dans une crèche, mais Marie l'a fait ! Elle l'a fait parce que le Seigneur l'a voulu ainsi. C'est la femme que le Seigneur veut maintenant !  **\n Proverbes 31 verset 10   **\nQui peut trouver une femme vertueuse ? Car son prix est bien au-dessus des rubis.  **\nMais malheureusement, beaucoup de femmes sont trop fières pour être utilisées ! Ils sont trop capiteux, c'est pourquoi il y a toujours problème. Vous recherchez l'honneur des femmes; vous exigez l'honneur , c'est pourquoi vous ne pouvez pas être utilisé. C'est pourquoi vous ne pouvez pas aller plus loin !  **\n1.6 Elle était soumise à la souffrance dans la volonté de Dieu   **\nLuc. 2 verset 34 à 36   **\n34 Et Siméon les bénit, et dit à Marie sa mère   Voici, cet enfant est prêt pour la chute et la relève de plusieurs en Israël ; et pour un signe contre lequel on dira;\n35 (Oui, une épée transpercera aussi ton âme) afin que les pensées de beaucoup de cœurs soient révélées.\n36 Et il y avait une Anne, une prophétesse, la fille de Phanuel, de la tribu d' Aser   elle était d'un grand âge, et avait vécu avec un mari sept ans depuis sa virginité.  **\nLa souffrance était attachée au fait d'être la mère de Jésus. Notez que Siméon ne parlait pas à Joseph. Il a dit à Marie. Le Seigneur est venu pour souffrir, et il avait besoin d'une femme qui accepterait de souffrir avec lui. Il voulait une femme qui irait avec lui dans la région de la souffrance, et la femme avec cette qualité était Marie. Cette qualité de supporter la honte, la disgrâce et l'abus est une qualité terrestre qui a été trouvée en Marie. Pensez-vous que c'était seulement Jésus qu'ils abusaient? Comme ils ont abusé de Jésus, ils ont aussi abusé de Marie. Beaucoup l'auraient défiée.\n« Pourquoi avez-vous donné naissance à une personne qui prétend qu'il est Dieu ? Ils l'auraient narguée de bien des façons. Dieu veut des femmes qui sont prêtes à souffrir avec leurs maris de toutes les manières.  **\nPhilippiens 1 verset 29   **\nCar il vous est donné en faveur de Christ, non seulement de croire en lui, mais aussi de souffrir pour lui.  **\n'Une épée transpercera aussi ton âme…' Mais pour toi, la moindre petite chose qui te touche te fait crier. Le moindre petit abus vous fait crier ; vous êtes prêt à le combattre. Ce n'est pas la femme que le Seigneur recherche; ce n'était pas le type de femme qui lui a donné naissance. Ce n'était pas le type de femme qu'il a choisi pour le service divin et le mémorial.  **\nMatthieu 2 verset 13 à 15   **\n13 Et quand ils furent partis, voici, l'ange du Seigneur apparut à Joseph en songe, disant   Lève-toi, prends le petit enfant et sa mère, et fuis en Égypte, et restes-y jusqu'à ce que je t'apporte un mot ; car Hérode cherchera le jeune enfant pour le détruire.\n14 Lorsqu'il se leva, il prit de nuit le petit enfant et sa mère, et partit pour l'Égypte.\n15 Et il y resta jusqu'à la mort d'Hérode ; afin que s'accomplît ce qui avait été dit du Seigneur par le prophète, disant  J'ai appelé mon Fils hors d'Égypte.  **\nElle était la mère d'un enfant persécuté, la mère d'un enfant que le diable cherchait de toutes ses forces. C'est ce qu'était Marie   se lever la nuit et parcourir une grande distance depuis Bethléem jusqu'en Égypte. Elle est allée jusqu'au bout, mais si c'était vous, vous auriez pu vous plaindre. C'est particulièrement pour vous qui vous plaignez de petites choses. Peu de souffrance à la maison, vous vous plaignez. Ce n'est pas le genre de femme que Dieu recherche. C'est une femme qui s'identifiera à Dieu dans sa souffrance.  **\nPhilippiens 3 verset 10   **\nAfin que je puisse le connaître, ainsi que la puissance de sa résurrection et la communion de ses souffrances, étant rendu conforme à sa mort.  **\nMary n'était pas pleine de murmures et de plaintes. Mais de petites choses vous font vous plaindre et murmurer. Un petit manque à la maison vous fatigue votre mari de murmures. Vos plaintes sont comme les gouttes de pluie du matin au soir. Vous rendez la maison insupportable.  **\nPhilippiens 2 verset 14 à 16   **\n14 Faites toutes choses sans murmures ni disputes   15 Afin que vous soyez irréprochables et innocents, les fils de Dieu, sans reproche, au milieu d'une nation perverse et perverse, au milieu de laquelle vous brillez comme des flambeaux dans le monde ;\n16 Proclamant la parole de vie; afin que je me réjouisse au jour de Christ, de n'avoir pas couru en vain, ni travaillé en vain.  **\nLe Seigneur te dit   « Femme , reviens, prends cette gloire. Adoptez cette qualité. C'est la qualité qui vous rendra utile dans la main du Seigneur en cette fin des temps et pour toujours.  **\n1.7 Elle était une mère aimante et attentionnée   **\nIl y avait de l'amour dans son cœur. Ce n'était pas une femme insouciante. Elle avait l'air bien et s'en souciait beaucoup. Si vous rencontriez Mary, alors vous verriez la beauté des soins, de l'amour et de la douceur.  **\nLuc 2 verset 41 à 48   **\n41 Or ses parents allaient chaque année à Jérusalem à la fête de la Pâque .\n42 Et quand il eut douze ans, ils montèrent à Jérusalem selon la coutume de la fête.\n43 Et quand ils eurent accompli les jours, comme ils revenaient, l'enfant Jésus s'attarda à Jérusalem ; et Joseph et sa mère ne le savaient pas.\n44 Mais eux, pensant qu'il était de la compagnie, firent une journée de voyage ; et ils le cherchaient parmi leurs parents et leurs connaissances.\n45 Et ne le trouvant pas, ils retournèrent à Jérusalem, le cherchant.\n46 Et il arriva qu'au bout de trois jours, ils le trouvèrent dans le temple, assis au milieu des docteurs, les écoutant et les interrogeant.\n47 Et tous ceux qui l'entendaient étaient étonnés de son intelligence et de ses réponses.\n48 Et quand ils le virent, ils furent dans l'étonnement, et sa mère lui dit   Mon fils, pourquoi nous as-tu agi ainsi ? Voici, ton père et moi t'avons cherché avec tristesse.  **\nJe veux que vous voyiez cette mère attentionnée   inquiète mais sous contrôle. Elle était attentionnée et compatissante. Elle avait le contrôle de ses émotions et de sa langue. Ils avaient passé une journée à chercher Jésus parmi le peuple. Lorsqu'ils ne l'ont pas trouvé là-bas, ils ont fait un voyage d'une journée pour retourner à Jérusalem et ont passé trois jours à le chercher. Si c'était vous, peut-être auriez-vous oublié toutes les promesses de Dieu sur l'enfant et toutes vos pensées seraient sur la façon de traiter l'enfant quand vous le voyez . Quand l'enfant a été retrouvé, avez-vous vu une femme brûlant de colère ? Non. Je parle des qualités de cette femme que vous appelez Marie, la mère de Jésus. En fait, nous ne nous soucions pas d'elle car c'est Jésus qui nous emmènera au ciel et non elle. Mais il y a quelque chose chez cette femme dont tu as besoin pour que toi aussi tu puisses être choisi par Dieu et utilisé, car il y a encore de grandes choses que tu dois faire pour Lui dans cette vie. Il y a encore de grandes choses que Dieu a désignées pour que les femmes fassent pour lui dans cette vie.  **\n deuxième Timothée 2 verset 19 à 21   **\n19 Néanmoins, le fondement de Dieu demeure assuré, ayant ce sceau   le Seigneur connaît ceux qui sont à lui. Et, Que quiconque nomme le nom de Christ s'éloigne de l'iniquité.\n20 Mais dans une grande maison, il n'y a pas seulement des vases d'or et d'argent, mais aussi de bois et de terre ; et certains à honorer , et certains à déshonorer .\n21 Si donc un homme se purifie de ceux-ci, il sera un vase d' honneur , sanctifié, propre à l'usage du maître, et préparé à toute bonne œuvre.  **\nVoyez le caractère de cette femme; le soin, le souci de chercher son enfant. Elle a passé des jours à chercher et quand l'enfant a été retrouvé, elle a eu le contrôle de ses émotions en parlant avec son enfant. \"Enfant, nous te cherchions. Pourquoi nous as-tu gardés comme ça ? Et la réponse de l'enfant, Jésus était en quelque sorte que si tu étais la mère tu te serais lâchée sur Lui \"Tu me demandes pourquoi je te cherche ?\" Apprenez à être sous contrôle. Apprenez à maîtriser vos émotions, car la blessure que vous causez à vos enfants fait mal à Dieu. Souvent , vous battez ces enfants alors qu'ils ne devraient pas être battus. Vous les battez juste à cause de votre personne ou de la colère dans votre cœur. La façon dont vous traitez ces enfants que Dieu vous a donnés le peine. Beaucoup d'entre eux ont des blessures aux yeux à cause de vous. Beaucoup ont des brûlures sur le corps à cause de vous. Pour certains, vous les avez juste poussés à frapper n'importe quoi. Sur d'autres, vous avez même jeté des charbons ardents du feu sur eux. Sur certains, vous versez de l'eau chaude sur l'enfant. Pouvez-vous voir la disparité entre vous et Mary, une femme passionnée comme vous ? Pouvez-vous voir le grand fossé entre vous et Mary ? Pourquoi cherchez-vous que Dieu vous utilise quand vous êtes comme ça ?  **\n1.8 Elle était une femme de compréhension spirituelle   **\nSon cœur était tourné vers Dieu pour en savoir plus. Elle a acquis une compréhension par la méditation sur la parole et les voies de Dieu, le style de vie et les activités de son Fils Jésus-Christ.  **\n Luc 2 verset 51  **\n51 Et il descendit avec eux, et vint à Nazareth, et leur fut soumis ; mais sa mère garda toutes ces paroles dans son cœur.\nTout ce que Dieu avait dit et tout ce qui était arrivé à son fils étaient gardés dans son cœur.  **\n Psaume 119 verset 11   **\n11 J'ai caché ta parole dans mon coeur, afin de ne pas pécher contre toi. Que Dieu vous donne la compréhension de ses voies et de son travail dans votre vie et à travers votre vie.  **\nColossiens 1 verset 8 à 11   **\n8 Qui nous a aussi déclaré ton amour dans l'Esprit ? 9 C'est pourquoi nous aussi, depuis le jour où nous l'avons entendu, nous ne cessons de prier pour vous et de désirer que vous soyez remplis de la connaissance de sa volonté en toute sagesse et intelligence spirituelle ;\n10 Afin que vous marchiez d'une manière digne du Seigneur et agréables à tous, étant féconds en toute bonne œuvre et croissant dans la connaissance de Dieu ;\n11 Fortifié de toute sa force, selon sa puissance glorieuse, jusqu'à toute patience et longanimité avec joie.  **\n1.9 Elle était une femme d'inspiration   **\nMary était tellement intéressée par son fils. Elle voulait qu'Il fasse quelque chose pour Dieu. Elle était une inspiratrice. Savez-vous que le premier miracle accompli par Jésus est venu par Marie ; le miracle qui a ouvert la porte au ministère surnaturel de Jésus a été causé par Marie. Elle s'intéressait à son fils et allait avec lui au mariage où il était invité.  **\nJohn. 2 verset 1 à 5   **\n1 Et le troisième jour, il y eut des noces à Cana de Galilée ; et la mère de Jésus était là. 2 Et Jésus fut appelé, ainsi que ses disciples, aux noces.\n3 Et comme ils manquaient de vin, la mère de Jésus lui dit   Ils n'ont pas de vin. 4 Jésus lui dit   Femme, qu'ai-je à faire avec toi ? Mon heure n'est pas encore venue.\n5 Sa mère dit aux serviteurs   Tout ce qu'il vous dira, faites-le.  **\nQui a rassemblé les serviteurs devant Jésus ? C'était Marie. Elle a fait confiance et a cru en Jésus. Elle croyait aux pouvoirs qui étaient incrustés en Jésus et était prête à les provoquer à l'action. Aussitôt, elle dit   « Ils n'ont pas de vin », elle alla rapidement rassembler des serviteurs pour leur dire d'obéir à Jésus. Jésus a dû être inculpé et Il a commencé à faire des miracles. C'était une bonne femme, une inspiratrice ; celui qui inspirerait les gens à servir le Seigneur. C'était Marie et c'est la qualité que Dieu voudra dans votre vie.  **\nHébreu 10 verset 24   **\nEt considérons-nous les uns les autres pour provoquer à l'amour et aux bonnes œuvres     **\nMarie a provoqué son fils à de bonnes œuvres à la gloire de Dieu. Faites-le aussi.\n1.10 Marie identifiée aux douleurs de Dieu sur l'humanité   **\nA aucun moment elle ne s'est enfuie ni cachée   elle a suivi. Malgré toutes les persécutions contre son Fils, elle l'a accompagné jusqu'à la crucifixion. Même lorsqu'ils l'ont crucifié et que beaucoup de ses disciples se sont enfuis, elle est restée là. J'espère que c'est parce qu'elle se tenait là que ses amis et d'autres l'ont rejointe, regardant son Fils souffrir. Était-elle en train de rire ? Était-elle en train de discuter ? Elle pleurait plutôt.  **\nJohn. 19 verset 25   **\n25 Or près de la croix de Jésus se tenaient sa mère et la sœur de sa mère, Marie, femme de Cléophas, et Marie de Magdala.  **\n\nCHAPITRE DEUX   **\nMARIE   FORMatrice D'ENFANTS SAGE ET VISIONNAIRE   **\n2.1 Marie a donné naissance à d'autres enfants   **\nVous pourriez dire   « Quel rôle a-t-elle joué dans l'éducation de Jésus, étant Dieu et Créateur, le Parfait ? Quelle partie?\" Eh bien, laissons de côté celle de Jésus. Marie a eu d'autres enfants. Voyons Marie dans d'autres enfants   ce qu'elle a fait pour susciter de grands prédicateurs pour le monde.  **\nProverbes 31 verset 25 à 31   **\n25 La force et l'honneur sont son vêtement; et elle se réjouira dans le temps à venir.\n26 Elle ouvre sa bouche avec sagesse; et dans sa langue est la loi de la bonté. 27 Elle regarde bien les voies de sa maison, et ne mange pas le pain de la paresse.\n28 Ses enfants se lèvent et la disent bienheureuse ; son mari aussi, et il la loue . 29 Beaucoup de filles ont agi vertueusement, mais tu les surpasses toutes.\n30 La faveur est trompeuse, et la beauté est vaine ; mais la femme qui craint l'Éternel sera louée.\n31 Donnez-lui du fruit de ses mains; et que ses propres œuvres la louent dans les portes.  **\nJe veux que vous sachiez que cette femme, Marie, a eu d'autres enfants après Jésus, il aurait dû y avoir au moins six autres enfants après Jésus.  **\nMatthieu. 13 verset 53 à 56   **\n53 Et il arriva que, lorsque Jésus eut achevé ces paraboles, il partit de là.\n54 Et lorsqu'il fut venu dans son pays, il les enseigna dans leur synagogue, au point qu'ils furent étonnés, et dirent   D'où cet homme a-t-il cette sagesse et ces œuvres puissantes ?\n55 N'est-ce pas le fils du charpentier ? Sa mère ne s'appelle-t-elle pas Marie ? Et ses frères, Jacques, et Joses , et Simon, et Judas ?\n56 Et ses sœurs, ne sont-elles pas toutes avec nous ? D'où vient donc cet Homme toutes ces choses ?  **\nDe cette Écriture, nous pouvons voir que Marie avait quatre fils et au moins deux filles. Ces enfants ont eu une naissance naturelle et sont nés dans le péché comme n'importe quel autre enfant dans le monde. Ces enfants sont nés de l'intimité de Marie avec Joseph son mari et dirent comme le Psalmiste « voici, j'ai été aiguisé dans l'iniquité ; et ma mère m'a conçu dans le péché.  **\nRomains 3 verset 23 Car tous ont péché et sont privés de la gloire de Dieu.\nTous dans le monde qui sont nés d'une relation sexuelle entre un homme et une femme sont nés dans le péché.  **\n 2.2 Les enfants de Marie étaient des pécheurs à la naissance comme vous   **\nLa sortie de Jésus du sein de Marie n'a pas lavé ce sein du péché. Son ventre pouvait encore produire des pécheurs. Pourquoi? C'est la loi normale. Le cas de Jésus était que la loi avait été mise de côté pour Lui, étant Dieu qui sortait. Le sang de son mari ne s'est pas mélangé au sien pour produire Jésus. La semence n'a pas été produite par Joseph. Mais tant que les autres enfants devaient être formés par la copulation naturelle du mâle et de la femelle comme l'homme et sa femme, les enfants seront des pécheurs. Par conséquent, tous ces six enfants étaient des pécheurs. Ils ont grandi impies comme les autres enfants. Ils ne croyaient pas en Jésus quand il était sur la terre avec eux. Je suppose que certains d'entre eux auraient été aussi têtus que vos propres enfants, parce qu'ils étaient des pécheurs. Certains auraient eu des traits particuliers comme votre enfant, peut-être, mais Mary a travaillé dessus.  **\nJean 7 verset 3 à 5   **\n3 Ses frères lui dirent donc   Va d'ici, et va en Judée, afin que tes disciples aussi voient les œuvres que tu fais .\n4 Car il n'y a personne qui fasse quelque chose en secret, et lui-même cherche à être connu ouvertement. Si tu fais ces choses, montre-toi au monde.\n5 Car ses frères non plus n'ont pas cru en lui.  **\nTous les autres enfants de Marie étaient des pécheurs, mais ils avaient une mère qui devait les ramener à la justice et les présenter à Dieu. Ils avaient une mère qui travaillait sur eux et faisait sortir d'eux la justice. Plus que cela, elle en ferait des ministres de l'évangile, des ministres qui contribueraient au salut du monde entier. Et le nom de leur mère était Marie.  **\nPremier Timothée 1 verset 5 à 6   **\n5 Or, celle qui est vraiment veuve et désolée, se confie en Dieu, et persévère nuit et jour dans les supplications et les prières.\n6 Mais celle qui vit dans le plaisir est morte tant qu'elle vit .  **\nIl semble également qu'à partir du silence scripturaire sur Joseph vers le début du ministère de Jésus, Joseph aurait pu mourir, laissant Marie seule pour s'occuper des enfants. On pense que c'est le cas parce que la Bible ne dit plus rien sur Joseph, depuis l'âge de 12 ans de Jésus, jusqu'à ce qu'il entre dans le ministère à 30 ans et termine le ministère. Même jusqu'aux Actes des Apôtres, rien n'a été dit au sujet de Joseph. Par conséquent, on suppose qu'il serait mort. Cela signifierait donc que six enfants ou plus étaient sous la garde d'une femme, et qu'elle n'était pas une superfemme. C'était une femme ordinaire comme vous, mais vouée à Dieu. Elle était passionnée par Jésus. C'était une femme comme vous   je ne sais pas si elle était grande, petite, grosse ou mince. Qui sait si elle vous ressemblait ?  **\nTite 2 verset 4 à 5   **\n4 Afin qu'elles apprennent aux jeunes filles à être sobres, à aimer leur mari, à aimer leurs enfants,\n5 Etre prudentes, chastes, gardiennes de la maison, bonnes, obéissantes à leurs propres maris, afin que la parole de Dieu ne soit pas blasphémée.  **\nJacques 5 verset 17 à 18   **\n17 Élie était un homme sujet aux mêmes passions que nous, et il priait avec ferveur pour qu'il ne pleuvît pas ; et il n'a pas plu sur la terre en l'espace de trois ans et six mois.\n18 Et il pria de nouveau, et le ciel donna de la pluie, et la terre produisit son fruit.  **\nDieu peut-il vous aider à former vos enfants pour Lui ?  **\n2.3 Marie a travaillé sur ses enfants incrédules   **\nProverbes 22 verset 6 Instruis un enfant dans la voie qu'il doit suivre ; et quand il sera vieux, il ne s'en écartera pas.  **\nMarie avait une sœur, Marie, la femme de Cléophas. Ainsi, il est clair qu'elle était humaine comme vous et non un ange créé au ciel. Mais cette femme a travaillé sur ses enfants incroyants jusqu'à ce que nous ayons des documents bibliques indiquant que certains sont devenus de grands prédicateurs renommés qui ont écrit une partie de la Bible, comme Jacques et Jude.  **\n2 Jean 1 verset 4   **\nJe me suis beaucoup réjoui d'avoir trouvé vos enfants marchant dans la vérité, comme nous avons reçu un commandement du Père .  **\nDieu n'a pas donné à ses enfants une repentance automatique simplement parce qu'ils sont sortis du même sein que Jésus. Le fait que vous soyez la femme d'un pasteur ne signifie pas que vos enfants doivent automatiquement se repentir. Vous devez les travailler. Mary a travaillé sur ses propres enfants. Le fait que Jésus, le Dieu même, était dans la famille depuis trente-trois ans et demi, ne signifiait pas que les enfants seraient automatiquement convertis. Ils pouvaient voir les miracles, ne savaient-ils pas que Jésus avait des disciples ? Ils se moquaient de lui comme on le voit dans notre texte. Néanmoins, Marie l'a pris avec Dieu et a travaillé sur eux jusqu'à ce qu'ils changent, deviennent justes et pieux. C'était l'œuvre de Marie !  **\nProverbes 11 verset 30 Le fruit du juste est un arbre de vie; et celui qui gagne des âmes est sage.  **\nApprenez de Marie. Ne soyez pas paresseux avec vos enfants. Ne croisez pas vos mains sur vos enfants. Ne les laissez pas aller en enfer. Dieu cherche vos enfants. Présentez-lui un sacrifice vivant. Que l'onction de Dieu tombe sur eux pour faire d'eux de grands prédicateurs qui apporteront le réveil au monde en cette fin des temps. Travaillez aussi bien sur vos enfants garçons que filles, quel que soit leur nombre. Apprenez de Marie.  **\nRomains 15 verset 4 à 5   **\n4 Car tout ce qui a été écrit auparavant l'a été pour notre instruction, afin que nous ayons l'espérance, par la patience et la consolation des Écritures.\n5 Or, que le Dieu de patience et de consolation vous accorde d'avoir les mêmes sentiments les uns envers les autres selon Jésus-Christ.  **\n2.4 Marie Était Disciple Du Christ   **\nMarie a suivi Jésus constamment jusqu'à sa mort. Elle a continué jusqu'à sa mort également.  **\nLoi. 1 verset 12 à 14   **\n12 Puis ils retournèrent à Jérusalem du mont appelé Olivet, qui est de Jérusalem à un jour de sabbat.\n13 Et quand ils furent entrés, ils montèrent dans une chambre haute, où demeuraient Pierre, et Jacques, et Jean, et André, Philippe, et Thomas, Barthélemy, et Matthieu, Jacques, fils d'Alphée, et Simon Zélote , et Judas, frère de Jacques.\n14 Ceux-ci continuaient tous d'un commun accord dans la prière et la supplication, avec les femmes, et Marie, la mère de Jésus, et avec ses frères.  **\nRendez gloire à Dieu ! Les frères de Jésus étaient entrés maintenant. Mary y avait travaillé. Alléluia! Ils avaient cru ! Cette femme les avait travaillés.  **\nPsaume 126 verset 5 à 6   **\n5 Ceux qui sèment dans les larmes moissonneront dans la joie. 6 Celui qui sort et pleure , portant une semence précieuse, reviendra sans aucun doute avec joie, apportant ses gerbes avec lui.  **\nPermettez-moi de vous donner un aperçu de l'une des choses que Marie a faites pour amener les frères de Jésus, ses enfants, en Christ. Elle réunit ses enfants à la campagne de Jésus. Elle voulait leur faire savoir qu'ils ne devaient pas voir le Seigneur comme un frère. Elle voulait qu'ils le voient comme leur Seigneur et Sauveur personnel . C'est ainsi qu'elle les travaillait.  **\nMatthieu 12 verset 46 à 50   **\n46 Pendant qu'il parlait encore au peuple, voici, sa mère et ses frères se tenaient dehors, désirant lui parler.\n47 Alors on lui dit   Voici, ta mère et tes frères se tiennent dehors, désirant te parler. 48 Mais il répondit et dit à celui qui le lui avait dit   Qui est ma mère ? Et qui sont mes frères ?\n49 Et il étendit la main vers ses disciples, et dit   Voici ma mère et mes frères !\n50 Car quiconque fera la volonté de mon Père qui est dans les cieux, celui-là est mon frère, et ma sœur, et ma mère.  **\n2.5 Marie a amené ses enfants à la campagne de Jésus   **\nMarie a amené ses enfants à entendre les vérités amères de la vie. « Allez et écoutez-le ! Si vous vous vantez selon la chair et refusez de vous conformer et de croire, vous serez perdu, damné ! Ne te vante jamais d'être né du même sein que Jésus   Il est le Seigneur, le Dieu de la vie, va et apprends par toi-même.  **\nPhilippiens 3 verset 3 Car nous sommes les circoncis, qui adorons Dieu en esprit, et nous réjouissons en Jésus-Christ, et n'avons aucune confiance dans la chair.  **\nMarie a travaillé sur ces enfants jusqu'à ce qu'après la mort de Jésus ou à n'importe quel moment, les enfants soient tous venus en Christ . Que Dieu accorde à vos enfants, à tous, le salut du Seigneur ? Que le Seigneur crée une place au paradis pour votre famille, afin que vos enfants arrivent tous au ciel au nom de Jésus ! Le Dieu qui l'a fait pour Marie le fera pour vous. Le Dieu qui a changé les enfants de Marie, environ six d'entre eux, changera les vôtres !  **\nÉsaïe 54 verset 13 Et tous tes enfants seront enseignés par l'Éternel; et grande sera la paix de tes enfants.  **\n2.6 Croyez que vos enfants vont changer.  **\nRomains 4 verset 17 à 22.  **\n17 (Comme il est écrit, je t'ai établi père d'une multitude de nations), devant celui en qui il a cru, oui Dieu, qui vivifie les morts et appelle comme si elles étaient ce qui n'est pas.\n18 Celui qui, contre toute espérance, a cru en l'espérance, afin de devenir le père d'une multitude de nations, selon ce qui a été annoncé, telle sera ta postérité.\n19 Et n'étant pas faible dans la foi, il ne considéra pas son propre corps maintenant mort, alors qu'il avait environ cent ans, ni encore la mort du ventre de Sara.\n20 Il n'a pas chancelé à la promesse de Dieu par incrédulité; mais était fort dans la foi, rendant gloire à Dieu; 21 Et étant pleinement persuadé que ce qu'il avait promis, il pouvait aussi l'accomplir.\n22 Et c'est pourquoi cela lui fut imputé à justice.  **\nMarie était une femme de foi. Quel que soit le comportement contraire qu'elle voyait chez ses enfants, cela ne l'a jamais émue. « J'ai déposé votre cas devant le Seigneur, et en ce qui me concerne, ce démon doit s'incliner ! La sorcellerie ne peut jamais fonctionner chez mon enfant, l'occultisme ne peut jamais fonctionner chez mon enfant. Le feu du Saint-Esprit les brûlera ! Mon enfant sera libre ! Votre enfant sera libre !  **\n2 Corinthiens 4 verset 13   **\nNous ayant le même esprit de foi, selon qu'il est écrit, j'ai cru, et c'est pourquoi j'ai parlé ; nous croyons aussi, et donc parlons.  **\nDieu le fera pour vous. Il l'a fait pour Mary, mais elle a travaillé. Lève-toi et travaille ! Deux de ses enfants, Jacques et Jude, sont devenus de grands prédicateurs et apôtres et de grands écrivains de la Bible. Nous verrons la confession de ces enfants quand leurs yeux s'ouvriront. Les yeux de vos enfants s'ouvriront !  **\nJacques 1 verset 1   **\nJacques, serviteur de Dieu et du Seigneur Jésus-Christ, aux douze tribus dispersées, salut.  **\nPouvez-vous recevoir ses salutations ? Recevez les salutations de James. Un des fils de Marie nous salue. J'apporte les salutations d'un des fils de Marie. Mais qu'a-t-il dit ? Il a dit qu'il était un serviteur de Dieu et du Seigneur Jésus-Christ. Il n'était pas digne d'appeler Jésus son frère, jamais ! Ses yeux s'étaient ouverts. Il avait compris que c'était le Seigneur lui-même qui était dans leur maison. Mary le savait bien plus tôt, mais eux non. Elle a travaillé sur eux jusqu'à ce que leurs yeux s'ouvrent pour le savoir aussi.  **\nLuc 24 verset 31. Et leurs yeux s'ouvrirent, et ils le reconnurent ; et Il disparut de devant eux.  **\nRegardons la deuxième personne, Jude, un autre fils de Marie. Il voulait se connecter à Jacques, mais pas à Jésus, car Jésus était son Seigneur et Sauveur . Il ne pouvait pas se connecter à Jésus charnellement simplement parce qu'ils venaient du même ventre.  **\nJude 1 verset 1 à 2.  **\n1 Jude, serviteur de Jésus-Christ, et frère de Jacques, à ceux qui sont sanctifiés par Dieu le Père, et conservés en Jésus-Christ, et appelés  \n2 À vous la miséricorde, et la paix, et l'amour, soyez multipliés.  **\nAlléluia! Applaudissez Marie   quelle merveille qu'elle ait élevé ces enfants pieux ! Elle a travaillé sur eux. Allez travailler sur vos enfants. Si vous n'êtes pas marié, préparez-vous à travailler sur vos enfants comme le Seigneur vous les donne. Enfants enseignants, préparez-vous à travailler sur ces enfants et élevez de grands prédicateurs pour le réveil de la fin des temps .  **\nProverbes 24 verset 30 à 34   **\n30 Je suis passé près du champ du paresseux, et de la vigne de l'homme dépourvu de sens;\n31 Et voici, tout était recouvert d'épines, et les orties en avaient couvert la face, et sa muraille de pierre était renversée.\n32 Alors j'ai vu, et j'ai bien considéré cela; Je l'ai regardé et j'ai reçu des instructions. 33 Encore un peu de sommeil, un peu de sommeil, un peu de jointure des mains pour dormir  \n34 Ainsi viendra ta pauvreté comme un voyageur ; et ton besoin d'homme armé ?  **\n\nCHAPITRE TROIS   **\nAVIS DE RECHERCHE   UNE MÈRE DES REVIVALISTES DE LA FIN DES TEMPS   **\n3.1 Vous pouvez être comme Marie   **\nLe Seigneur te cherche maintenant femme. Il vous a montré Marie à imiter. Vous comprenez maintenant qui elle était. Maintenant, Il vous cherche pour vous utiliser comme portrait d'une sainte femme en ce temps de la fin et pour élever de grands leaders et prédicateurs chrétiens du temps de la fin pour Lui.  **\nPremier Timothée 2 verset 7, 10,  **\n7 pour lequel j'ai été ordonné prédicateur et apôtre, (je dis la vérité en Christ, et je ne mens pas ;) enseignant des Gentils dans la foi et la vérité.\n10 Mais (ce qui convient aux femmes professant la piété) avec de bonnes œuvres.  **\nPremier Timothée 4 verset 12   **\nQue personne ne méprise ta jeunesse ; mais sois un exemple pour les croyants, en parole, en conversation, en charité, en esprit, en foi, en pureté.  **\nLe Seigneur a dit que nous devrions demander, y a-t-il une femme qui veut lui donner des enfants, afin qu'il puisse les utiliser pour récupérer l'église et le monde ? Y a-t-il une femme prête ? Pouvons-nous trouver une femme qui a ces qualités de Marie qui peut produire des enfants pour le réveil de la fin des temps ? Dans l'Ancien Testament, il y a une femme qui ressemblait à Marie. Je vous ai dit que la qualité ne se limite pas à Marie, ce sont toutes des qualités humaines. Regarde cette femme, Hannah.  **\nPremier Samuel 1 verset 9 à 19, 26 à 28   **\n9 Anne se leva donc après qu'ils eurent mangé à Silo et qu'ils eurent bu. Le sacrificateur Éli était assis sur un siège près d'un poteau du temple de l'Éternel.\n10 Et elle était dans l'amertume de l'âme, et priait l'Éternel, et pleurait amèrement.\n11 Et elle fit un vœu, et dit   Ô Éternel des armées, si tu regardes vraiment l'affliction de ta servante, et que tu te souviennes de moi, et que tu n'oublies pas ta servante, mais que tu donnes à ta servante un enfant mâle, alors je donne-le à l'Éternel tous les jours de sa vie, et il n'y aura pas de rasoir sur sa tête.\n12 Et il arriva, comme elle continuait à prier devant l'Éternel, qu'Eli marqua sa bouche.\n13 Or Hannah, elle a parlé dans son coeur; seules ses lèvres remuaient, mais sa voix ne se faisait pas entendre   par conséquent, Eli pensait qu'elle avait été ivre.\n14 Et Éli lui dit   Jusques à quand seras-tu ivre ? Ote ton vin loin de toi.\n15 Et Anne répondit et dit   Non , mon seigneur, je suis une femme d'un esprit triste ; je n'ai bu ni vin ni boisson forte, mais j'ai répandu mon âme devant l'Éternel.\n16 Ne compte pas ta servante pour une fille de Bélial, car c'est de l'abondance de ma plainte et de ma douleur que j'ai parlé jusqu'ici.\n17 Alors Éli répondit et dit   Va en paix, et le Dieu d'Israël t'accorde la requête que tu lui as demandée.\n18 Et elle dit   Que ta servante trouve grâce à tes yeux. La femme s'en alla donc et mangea, et son visage n'était pas plus triste.\n19 Et ils se levèrent de bonne heure le matin, et se prosternèrent devant l'Éternel, et s'en retournèrent, et vinrent dans leur maison à Rama; et Elqana connut Anne sa femme; et le Seigneur se souvint d'elle.\n26 Et elle dit   Ô mon seigneur, aussi ton âme vit , mon seigneur, je suis la femme qui se tenait ici à côté de toi, priant l'Éternel. 27 Pour cet enfant j'ai prié; et l'Éternel m'a donné ma demande que je lui ai demandée \n28 C'est pourquoi aussi je l'ai prêté à l'Éternel; tant qu'il vivra, il sera prêté à l'Éternel. Et là, il adora l'Éternel.  **\n 3.2 Femme, présente cet enfant à Dieu   **\nAs-tu compris, femme ? Cette Ecriture sera-t-elle accomplie dans votre vie ? Femme de foi, vous feriez mieux d'attraper cette écriture. Le Seigneur vous cherche. Pouvez-vous Lui confier votre enfant ? Pouvez-vous travailler sur cet enfant et le présenter au Seigneur ? Si vous n'avez pas d'enfant, pouvez-vous croire Dieu pour un seul afin de donner à Dieu pour le réveil de la fin des temps ? pouvez-vous en former un pour Dieu? Si le monde attend encore 10 ans, vos enfants devraient jouer un rôle d'évangile dans ce monde. Si le monde devait attendre 20 ans voire 30 ans de plus que votre enfant ait la possibilité d'être mûr pour faire des exploits pour Dieu ! La sainteté doit se répandre. La bouche de votre enfant y contribuera. Votre enfant écrira des livres oints. Votre enfant chantera des cantiques de salut. Cela devrait être votre engagement. Vous allez vous engager envers Dieu, ainsi   « Seigneur, mon enfant te servira bien. Pour vous qui n'avez pas d'enfant et qui avez dépassé l'âge de procréer ou qui n'avez même pas de mari, vous direz ainsi à Dieu   « Seigneur, peux-tu par ta miséricorde m'amener un enfant ? C'est peut-être l'enfant de quelqu'un, mais je veux élever l'enfant pour toi. Laissez-moi élever quelqu'un qui contribuera à la renaissance du monde. Amen.  **\nDeuxième Timothée 1 verset 1, 2, 5, 6.  **\n1 Paul, apôtre de Jésus-Christ par la volonté de Dieu, selon la promesse de vie qui est en Jésus-Christ,\n2 À Timothée, mon fils bien-aimé   grâce, miséricorde et paix, de la part de Dieu le Père et de Jésus-Christ notre Seigneur.\n5 Quand j'appellerai au souvenir la foi sincère qui est en toi, qui a d'abord habité ta grand-mère Loïs et ta mère Eunice ; et je suis persuadé qu'en toi aussi.\n6 C'est pourquoi je te rappelle de réveiller le don de Dieu qui est en toi par l'imposition de mes mains.  **\nSi vous pouvez prier, le Seigneur vous surprendra. Apprenez de Marie   ce n'était pas une femme insouciante, c'était une femme zélée, pieuse, sainte, passionnée et compatissante. C'était une femme qui s'est identifiée à Dieu concernant les péchés de cette vie; elle a pleuré avec Dieu. Quand le Seigneur criait sur la croix, elle pleurait aussi à côté de la croix pour le salut du monde. Et cette femme a produit des enfants qui ont travaillé pour le salut du monde. Laissez vos enfants contribuer au salut de l'humanité !\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "CE QUE LES DÉNOMINATIONS ONT FAIT DE MAL  **\nAux premiers temps où la dénomination a commencé dans le christianisme  **\n1. Ils ont sauvé l'Église du catholicisme et de son autocratie\n2. Ils ont sauvé l'Église des hérésies doctrinales perpétrées par de faux enseignants\nPremier Timothée 6 verset 5  **\nDisputes perverses d'hommes aux esprits corrompus et dépourvus de la vérité, supposant que le gain est la piété; de tels retire-toi.  **\n3. Ils ont uni les vrais croyants pour former une assemblée de vrais adorateurs\n Hébreux 10 verset 5  **\nNe pas renoncer à nous assembler, comme c'est la manière de certains ; mais s'exhortant les uns les autres; et d'autant plus que vous voyez le jour approcher.  **\n4.Ils ont préservé la vérité de l'Écriture dans les temps anciens.\nRAISONS POUR LESQUELLES LES DÉNOMINATIONS ONT ÉCHOUÉ DIEU.  **\nMais maintenant, les dénominations ont déçu Dieu pour les raisons énoncées ci-dessous  \n1. Les dénominations rendent l'Église ouverte à quiconque peut en commencer une, qu'il soit appelé par Dieu ou non, qu'il soit né de nouveau ou non.  **\nJérémie. 23 verset 32  **\nVoici, je suis contre ceux qui prophétisent de faux rêves, dit l'Éternel, et les racontent, et font errer mon peuple par leurs mensonges et par leur légèreté; pourtant je ne les ai pas envoyés, ni ne leur ai commandé; c'est pourquoi ils ne profiteront en rien à ce peuple, dit l'Éternel.  **\n2. Les dénominations n'ont pas de freins et contrepoids parce que chaque dénomination est pratiquement indépendante de l'autre. Certains sont même indépendants de Dieu et des Saintes Ecritures.  **\nEsaïe 65 verset 5  **\nQui disent   Tiens-toi tranquille, ne m'approche pas ; car je suis plus saint que toi. Ce sont une fumée dans mon nez, un feu qui brûle toute la journée.  **\n3. Les êtres humains sont à la merci de leurs semblables qui sont les fondateurs d'églises et les dirigeants confessionnels. Chaque dirigeant fait ce qu'il veut de ses membres pour accomplir sa volonté.\nJérémie 2 verset 8  **\n8 Les sacrificateurs n'ont pas dit   Où est le Seigneur ? et ceux qui manient la loi ne m'ont pas connu; les pasteurs aussi ont transgressé contre moi, et les prophètes ont prophétisé par Baal, et ont marché après des choses qui ne profitent pas.  **\n4. La Bible n'est plus considérée comme le livre central pour la doctrine et la pratique de la justice  **\nMarc 7 verset 7 à 9  **\n7 Mais c'est en vain qu'ils m'adorent, enseignant comme doctrines des commandements d'hommes. 8 Car, abandonnant le commandement de Dieu, vous retenez la tradition des hommes, comme le lavage des pots et des coupes, et bien d'autres choses semblables que vous faites.\n9 Et il leur dit   Vous rejetez fort bien le commandement de Dieu, afin de garder votre propre tradition.  **\n5. Chacun est libre d'interpréter la Bible et d'en diriger la pratique. Cela met l'Écriture entre les mains d'enseignants ignorants et corrompus.  **\nMatthieu 15 verset 14  **\nLaissez-les tranquilles, ce sont des aveugles leaders d'aveugles. Et si un aveugle conduit un aveugle, tous deux tomberont dans le fossé.  **\n6. Les dénominations engendrent des arguments parce qu'aucun chef de dénomination ne veut se soumettre à l'autorité scripturaire d'un autre  **\nTroisième Jean 9 à 10  **\n9 J'ai écrit à l'Église, mais Diotrèphe, qui aime avoir la prééminence parmi eux, ne nous reçoit pas.\n10 C'est pourquoi, si je viens, je me souviendrai de ses actions, qu'il commet, en parlant contre nous avec des paroles malveillantes; et non content de cela, il ne reçoit pas non plus lui-même les frères, et interdit à ceux qui le voudraient, et les chasse de l'Église.  **\n7. Les dénominations promeuvent une approche mondaine dans le pastorat et la préservation des membres parce que la croissance, la popularité et la richesse sont leur objectif, pas le ciel.  **\nPhilippiens 3 verset 18 à 20  **\n18 (Car plusieurs marchent, dont je vous ai parlé souvent, et maintenant je vous dis même en pleurant, qu'ils sont les ennemis de la croix de Christ  \n19 Dont la fin est la destruction, dont Dieu est le ventre, et dont la gloire est dans leur honte, qui s'occupent des choses terrestres.) 20 Car notre conversation est dans les cieux ; d'où aussi nous attendons le Sauveur, le Seigneur Jésus-Christ    **\n8. De nombreuses dénominations engendrent une concurrence dans les réalisations parce que les dirigeants des dénominations cherchent à plaire aux hommes pour les attirer dans leur église ; ils ne plaisent pas à Dieu en gardant Sa vérité et Sa justice.\n9. Ils excluent Dieu dans leurs affaires parce que la Vérité, la Droiture et la Sainteté ne peuvent pas être maintenues là où l'avantage humain est le moteur du ministère.\n10. La droiture et la sainteté de la vie ont été remplacées par la recherche d'argent, l'adhésion, la structure de culte et l'excellence mondaine dans la musique et le divertissement.  **\n Premier Timothée 6 verset 6, 9 à 11  **\n6 Mais la piété avec contentement est un grand gain. 9 Mais ceux qui veulent devenir riches tombent dans la tentation et dans un piège, et dans beaucoup de convoitises folles et nuisibles, qui noient les hommes dans la destruction et la perdition. 10 Car l'amour de l'argent est la racine de tout mal, que tandis que certains convoitaient, ils se sont égarés de la foi, et se sont percés de beaucoup de douleurs.\n11 Mais toi, homme de Dieu, fuis ces choses ; et recherchez la justice, la piété, la foi, l'amour, la patience, la douceur.  **\n11. Les dénominations ouvrent la porte à Satan pour venir fournir des pouvoirs démoniaques, des méthodes et des ressources pour le succès ; Satan est rapidement prêt à prendre le contrôle de l'Église des dirigeants impies en introduisant la sorcellerie et l'utilisation des charmes.  **\n2 Corinthiens 11 verset 13 à 15  **\n13 Car tels sont de faux apôtres, des ouvriers trompeurs, se transformant en apôtres de Christ. 14 Et rien d'étonnant; car Satan lui-même se transforme en ange de lumière. 15 C'est pourquoi ce n'est pas grand-chose si ses ministres aussi sont transformés en ministres de justice ; dont la fin sera selon leurs oeuvres.  **\n12. Ils détruisent l'unité et l'unité dans la doctrine, l'évangélisation et la vie sainte biblique, parce que les églises ne sont pas toutes sous un seul Seigneur Jésus et sous le contrôle du Saint-Esprit.\n13. Les membres de l'Église croient et se soumettent à leurs dirigeants, surveillants, évêques et surintendants dénominationnels plus qu'à Dieu. Il n'y a, dans de nombreux cas, aucune différence entre la soumission à leur chef et l'adoration de leur chef, puisqu'ils peuvent enfreindre les Écritures pour plaire à leurs dirigeants d'église.  **\nEFFETS NÉGATIFS DU DÉNOMINATIONALISME SUR L'ÉGLISE  **\n1. Dans une grande mesure, l'église n'est plus sous le contrôle de Dieu\n2. L'église n'est plus unie parce que chaque dirigeant cherche sa propre gloire.  **\nJean 5 verset 41,42,44  **\n41 Je ne reçois pas l'honneur des hommes. 42 Mais je vous connais, que vous n'avez pas l'amour de Dieu en vous. 44 Comment pouvez-vous croire, vous qui recevez l'honneur les uns des autres, et ne cherchez pas l'honneur qui vient de Dieu seul ?  **\n3. L'église est laissée entre les mains de nombreux dirigeants que Dieu n'a pas appelés au ministère\nHébreux 5 verset 4  **\nEt nul ne s'attribue cet honneur, si ce n'est celui qui est appelé de Dieu, comme le fut Aaron.\n4. L'église est nourrie de paille et d'enseignements qui tuent la vraie foi chrétienne   **\n2 Timothée 2 versets 17 à 18  **\n17 Et leur parole dévorera comme un chancre; de qui est Hyménée et Philète ; 18 qui, concernant la vérité, se sont égarés, disant que la résurrection est déjà passée ; et renverser la foi de certains.  **\n5. La propagation de l'église dénominationnelle se fait par la sagesse et la puissance des hommes, non par le Saint-Esprit. Par conséquent, diverses formes de programmes et de substances sont introduites pour supprimer la présence de Dieu   eau bénite, tablier, mouchoir, sable, huile, etc. Ceux-ci sont utilisés contrairement à la parole de Dieu pour polluer les fidèles.\n6. La foi des fidèles repose sur la sagesse et la puissance de leur pasteur, chef, évêque, surveillant, surintendant, et non sur le Seigneur Jésus-Christ qui est mort pour eux.  **\nPremier Timothée 2 verset 4 à 5  **\n4 qui veut que tous les hommes soient sauvés et parviennent à la connaissance de la vérité. 5 Car il y a un seul Dieu, et un seul médiateur entre Dieu et les hommes, l'homme Christ Jésus ;  **\n7. Les églises se rejettent littéralement, se combattent et se font concurrence pour l'adhésion, les gains monétaires et matériels.  **\nGalates. 5 verset 15 Mais si vous vous mordez et vous dévorez les uns les autres, prenez garde de ne pas vous consumer les uns les autres.  **\n8. La direction centrale (CAN, PFN), élevée au-dessus de l'église par le gouvernement ne peut interférer avec l'église que socialement, politiquement, relationnellement et non doctrinalement, spirituellement ou dans la sainteté.  **\n1 Corinthiens 2 verset 14  **\nMais l'homme naturel ne reçoit pas les choses de l'Esprit de Dieu, car elles sont une folie pour lui ; il ne peut pas non plus les connaître, parce qu'ils sont spirituellement discernés.  **\n9. Le message et les exigences de l'Écriture sont facultatifs et par choix, non obligatoires car les règles confessionnelles, les règlements et les décrets des dirigeants sont considérés comme supérieurs à l'Écriture.\n10. La parole du Seigneur souffre de dilution, de résistance et d'attaques dans les églises, à commencer par les dirigeants.  **\nTroisième Jean 9 à 10  **\n9 J'ai écrit à l'église; mais Diotrèphe, qui aime avoir la prééminence parmi eux, ne nous reçoit pas.\n10 C'est pourquoi, si je viens, je me souviendrai de ses actes, qu'il commet, en blaguant contre nous avec des paroles malveillantes ; et non content de cela, il ne reçoit pas non plus lui-même les frères, et interdit à ceux qui le voudraient, et les chasse de l'Église.  **\n11. La parole écrite et prophétique de Dieu n'a aucun pouvoir contraignant sur les ministres et les membres de l'église parce qu'ils n'y croient pas.\n12. Le retour de Jésus-Christ dans l'enlèvement n'est pas connu, ou est contesté ou n'est pas préparé par de nombreuses assemblées.\n13. De nombreuses églises ne sont plus les piliers et le fondement de la vérité dans le monde, mais sont devenues l'habitation des démons.  **\nApocalypse 18 verset 2,4,5  **\n2 Et il cria puissamment d'une voix forte, disant   Babylone la grande est tombée, est tombée, et est devenue l'habitation des démons, et le repaire de tout esprit immonde, et la cage de tout oiseau impur et odieux.\n4 Et j'entendis une autre voix du ciel, disant   Sortez d'elle, mon peuple, afin que vous ne participiez pas à ses péchés, et que vous ne receviez pas de ses fléaux.\n5 Car ses péchés sont montés jusqu'au ciel, et Dieu s'est souvenu de ses iniquités.  **\n14. A cause de la rétrogradation et de l'apostasie, les églises suivent le large chemin vers l'enfer et la damnation éternelle\n15. Très peu d'églises et de ministres suivent le chemin étroit de la justice, de la sainteté et de la vie éternelle.  **\nMatthieu 7 verset 13,14  **\n13 Entrez par la porte étroite ; car large est la porte, et spacieux est le chemin qui mènent à la perdition, et il y en a beaucoup qui entrent par là ; 14 car étroite est la porte, et resserré le chemin qui mènent à la vie, et il y en a peu qui la trouvent.  **\nREMÈDE DU CHRIST POUR SON ÉGLISE DE LA FIN DES TEMPS  **\nLe Seigneur dans sa miséricorde a décidé   1. De retirer l'église des mains des philosophes et des dirigeants trompeurs qui sont inaptes à conduire son peuple vers la vie éternelle.  **\nEzéchiel 34 verset 1 à 3, 9 à 11  **\n1 Et la parole de l'Éternel vint à moi, disant   2 Fils de l'homme, prophétise contre les bergers d'Israël, prophétise, et dis-leur   Ainsi parle l'Éternel, l'Éternel, aux bergers ; Malheur aux bergers d'Israël qui se nourrissent eux-mêmes ! les bergers ne doivent-ils pas nourrir les troupeaux ?\n3 Vous mangez la graisse, et vous vous habillez de laine, vous tuez ceux qui sont nourris, mais vous ne faites pas paître le troupeau. 9 C'est pourquoi, ô bergers, écoutez la parole de l'Éternel;\n10 Ainsi parle le Seigneur, l'Éternel; Voici, je suis contre les bergers; et je leur redemanderai mon troupeau, et je leur ferai cesser de paître le troupeau; les bergers ne se nourriront plus non plus; car je délivrerai mon troupeau de leur bouche, afin qu'ils ne soient plus leur nourriture. 11 Car ainsi parle le Seigneur, l'Éternel ; Voici, moi, moi-même, je vais à la fois fouiller mes brebis et les chercher.  **\n2. Prendre en charge Son église pour les diriger directement par Lui-même.  **\nJean 10 verset 14 à 16, 27, 28  **\n14 Je suis le bon berger, et je connais mes brebis, et je suis connu des miennes. 15 Comme le Père me connaît, moi aussi je connais le Père, et je donne ma vie pour les brebis.\n16 Et les autres brebis que j'ai, qui ne sont pas de cette bergerie, je dois les amener aussi, et elles entendront ma voix; et il y aura un seul troupeau et un seul berger.\n27 Mes brebis entendent ma voix, et je les connais, et elles me suivent   28 Et je leur donne la vie éternelle ; et ils ne périront jamais, et personne ne les ravira de ma main.  **\n3. Pour restaurer l'église à la juste place d'Autorité et de Pouvoir sur terre.\n Matthieu 16 verset 18  **\nEt je te dis aussi que tu es Pierre, et sur ce roc je bâtirai mon Église; et les portes de l'enfer ne prévaudront pas contre lui.  **\n4. Le Seigneur a décidé de récupérer la Place, l'Efficacité, la Puissance et l'Autorité de Sa parole éternelle.  **\n1 Thessaloniciens 2 verset 13  **\nC'est pourquoi aussi nous rendons grâces à Dieu sans cesse, parce que, lorsque vous avez reçu la parole de Dieu que vous avez entendue de nous, vous ne l'avez pas reçue comme la parole des hommes, mais comme elle est en vérité, la parole de Dieu, qui agit efficacement. aussi en vous qui croyez.  **\n5. Promouvoir la place de la parole écrite, parlée et prophétique de Dieu dans l'église.  **\nEsaïe 55 verset 10, 11  **\n10 Car, comme la pluie tombe et la neige du ciel, et n'y retourne pas, mais arrose la terre, et la fait germer et bourgeonner, afin qu'elle donne de la semence au semeur, et du pain à celui qui mange  \n11 Ainsi en sera-t-il de ma parole qui sort de ma bouche, elle ne me reviendra pas sans effet, mais elle accomplira ce que je veux, et elle prospérera dans la chose à laquelle je l'ai envoyée.  **\n6. Pour libérer le pouvoir de conviction de sa parole non diluée sur les pécheurs pour leur vraie foi en Christ et le salut du péché.  **\nActes 2 verset 37 à 39  **\n37 Lorsqu'ils entendirent cela, ils furent piqués au cœur, et dirent à Pierre et au reste des apôtres   Hommes et frères, que ferons-nous ?\n38 Alors Pierre leur dit   Repentez-vous, et que chacun de vous soit baptisé au nom de Jésus-Christ pour la rémission des péchés, et vous recevrez le don du Saint-Esprit.\n39 Car la promesse est pour vous, et pour vos enfants, et pour tous ceux qui sont au loin, en aussi grand nombre que le Seigneur notre Dieu les appellera.  **\n7. Pour orner les Doctrines de la Sainte Ecriture dans Son église.  **\nTite 2 verset 7 à 10  **\n7 En toutes choses, montre-toi un modèle de bonnes œuvres; dans la doctrine montrant l'intégrité, la gravité, la sincérité,\n8 Parole saine, qui ne peut être condamnée; afin que celui qui est du côté contraire ait honte, n'ayant rien à dire de mal de vous.\n9 Exhorte les serviteurs à obéir à leurs propres maîtres et à leur plaire en toutes choses; ne plus répondre ; 10 Ne pas dérober, mais montrer toute bonne fidélité; afin qu'ils ornent en toutes choses la doctrine de Dieu notre Sauveur.  **\n8. Promouvoir la Vérité, la Droiture et la Sainteté par l'action de Son Saint-Esprit parmi les croyants.  **\nPremier Timothée 3 verset 15  **\nMais si j'attends longtemps, que tu saches comment tu dois te conduire dans la maison de Dieu, qui est l'église du Dieu vivant, la colonne et le fondement de la vérité.  **\n9. Pour révéler et détruire les œuvres et les activités de la chair dans l'Église.  **\n1 Jean 3 verset 8 Dans ce but, le Fils de Dieu a été manifesté, afin de détruire les oeuvres du diable.\nPremier Pierre 4 verset 17, 18  **\n17 Car le temps est venu où le jugement doit commencer par la maison de Dieu ; et si cela commence d'abord par nous, quelle sera la fin de ceux qui n'obéissent pas à l'évangile de Dieu ?\n18 Et si le juste est à peine sauvé, où apparaîtront l'impie et le pécheur ?  **\n10. Pour détourner l'église de l'emprise des dénominations vers son autorité et mettre l'église entre les mains d'un leadership non confessionnel qui respecte et honore sa parole et son nom.  **\nActes 20 verset 28 à 30  **\n28 Prenez donc garde à vous-mêmes et à tout le troupeau sur lequel le Saint-Esprit vous a établis surveillants, pour nourrir l'Église de Dieu, qu'il a acquise de son propre sang.\n29 Car je sais ceci, qu'après mon départ, des loups cruels entreront parmi vous, n'épargnant pas le troupeau. 30 Des hommes s'élèveront aussi de vous-mêmes, disant des choses perverses, pour entraîner des disciples après eux.  **\nTite 1 verset 1 à 3  **\n1 Paul, serviteur de Dieu et apôtre de Jésus-Christ, selon la foi des élus de Dieu et la reconnaissance de la vérité qui est selon la piété ; 2 Dans l'espérance de la vie éternelle, que Dieu, qui ne peut mentir, a promise avant que le monde ait commencé ; 3 Mais il a manifesté sa parole en temps voulu par la prédication, qui m'est confiée selon le commandement de Dieu notre Sauveur.  **\n11. Faire des apparitions aux hommes, femmes et enfants, croyants et incroyants, pour authentifier les vérités scripturaires.\n12. Emmener les gens en enfer et au paradis pour confirmer le message des Écritures afin que tous connaissent et croient la vérité qui mène au ciel.  **\nEsaïe 66 verset 24  **\nEt ils sortiront, et verront les cadavres des hommes qui ont transgressé contre moi, car leur ver ne mourra pas, et leur feu ne s'éteindra pas ; et ils seront en horreur pour toute chair.  **\nEzéchiel 40 verset 4  **\nEt l'homme me dit   Fils de l'homme, regarde de tes yeux, et écoute de tes oreilles, et attache ton cœur à tout ce que je te montrerai ; car c'est dans l'intention que je te les montre que tu es amené ici. Raconte tout ce que tu vois à la maison d'Israël.  **\n13. Jésus a décidé d'exposer les vêtements et les parures impies qui damnent les âmes des hommes et des femmes dans le feu de l'enfer.  **\n Apocalypse 22 verset 16  **\nMoi, Jésus, j'ai envoyé mon ange pour vous témoigner ces choses dans les églises (expériences de l'enfer et du paradis). Je suis la racine et la postérité de David, et l'étoile brillante du matin.  **\n14. Pour élever le mouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde non confessionnel pour servir de lumière aux églises sur terre sur la vérité, la justice et la sainteté.\n15. Donner au Mouvement de Réveil de la Sainteté et à son chef désigné par Dieu en cette fin des temps le mandat pour l'unité de l'église dans la doctrine et la vie sainte en préparation de Son prochain retour dans l'enlèvement.  **\nActes 22 verset 14,15  **\n14 Et il dit   Le Dieu de nos pères t'a choisi, afin que tu connaisses sa volonté, et que tu voies ce juste, et que tu entendes la voix de sa bouche. 15 Car tu seras son témoin devant tous les hommes de ce que tu as vu et entendu.  **\n16. Le Seigneur Jésus a décidé de condamner les hommes, les femmes et les enfants par des signes divins à croire, recevoir, promouvoir et publier les messages et les enseignements scripturaires du mouvement de réveil de la sainteté dans le monde parmi les églises et les hommes du monde comme norme requise pour échapper au feu de l'enfer et l'entrée au ciel lors de l'enlèvement ou après la mort sur terre.  **\nColossiens. 1 verset 28, 29  **\n28 Lequel nous prêchons, avertissant chacun et enseignant chacun en toute sagesse; afin que nous présentions tout homme parfait en Jésus-Christ. 29 A quoi je travaille aussi, luttant selon son oeuvre, qui agit puissamment en moi.  **\n17. Libérer l'esprit d'unité et d'unité chrétiennes dans les églises du Christ dans le monde comme le dernier acte de miséricorde pour le salut humain et la vie éternelle.  **\nÉphésiens. 4 versets 3 à 6  **\n3 S'efforçant de garder l'unité de l'Esprit par le lien de la paix. 4 Il y a un seul corps et un seul Esprit, de même que vous êtes appelés à une seule espérance de votre vocation ; 5 Un seul Seigneur, une seule foi, un seul baptême, 6 Un seul Dieu et Père de tous, qui est au-dessus de tous, et parmi tous, et en vous tous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "body": "CE QUE DIT LA BIBLE SUR L'UTILISATION DES BIJOUX  **\n Premier Timothée 2 verset 9 à 10  **\n9 De même aussi, que les femmes se parent d'habits modestes, avec pudeur et sobriété ; pas avec des cheveux tressés , ou de l'or, ou des perles, ou une parure coûteuse;\n10 Mais (ce qui convient aux femmes professant la piété) avec de bonnes œuvres.  **\nLe mot 'Gold' signifie aussi bijoux. C'est un mot composé qui désigne tous les éléments d'ornementation que les hommes, et en particulier les femmes, utilisent pour promouvoir la beauté corporelle pour la louange humaine. L'or ou les bijoux sont détaillés dans cette Écriture.  **\nNombres 31 verset 50 à 51  **\n50 Nous avons donc apporté une offrande pour l'Éternel, ce que chacun a obtenu, de bijoux d'or, de chaînes et de bracelets, d'anneaux, de boucles d'oreilles et de tablettes (collier), pour faire l'expiation pour nos âmes devant l'Éternel.\n51 Et Moïse et Eléazar, le sacrificateur, prirent leur or, tous les bijoux ouvrés. Ici, ils ont été recueillis auprès des païens par les enfants d'Israël qui les ont utilisés après une guerre divinement ordonnée réussie contre eux. Dans le passage ci-dessus, les bijoux incluent ; boucles d'oreilles, bagues (alliances).  **\nNombres 31 verset 1  **\n1 Et l'Éternel parla à Moïse, disant   2 Venge les fils d'Israël des Madianites, après quoi tu seras rassemblé vers ton peuple.  **\nIls ont été apportés comme une offrande d'action de grâce par les guerriers à Dieu pour les avoir tous protégés dans la guerre achevée. Ces objets devaient être transformés en ustensiles dans le tabernacle que Dieu avait ordonné de construire pour lui parmi les enfants d'Israël. Alors que les hommes et les femmes pécheurs recherchent la beauté des bijoux, Dieu donne la beauté du caractère divin.  **\nEsaïe 61 verset 10  **\nje me réjouirai beaucoup dans le Seigneur, mon âme s'égayera en mon Dieu; car il m'a revêtu des vêtements du salut, il m'a couvert de la robe de justice, comme un époux se pare d'ornements, et comme une épouse se pare de ses bijoux.  **\nExode 35 verset 4 à 5, 22  **\n4 Et Moïse parla à toute l'assemblée des enfants d'Israël, disant   C'est ici la chose que l'Éternel a commandée, en disant  \n5 Prenez du milieu de vous une offrande à l'Éternel; quiconque est d'un coeur bien disposé, qu'il l'apporte, une offrande au Seigneur; l'or, l'argent et l'airain,\n22 Et ils vinrent, hommes et femmes, tous ceux qui avaient le cœur bien disposé, et apportèrent des bracelets, et des boucles d'oreilles, et des bagues, et des tablettes, tous des bijoux d'or ; et chaque homme qui offrait offrait une offrande d'or à l'Éternel.  **\nNous devrons peut-être nous rappeler que ces objets ont été collectés auprès des Égyptiens lorsque les enfants d'Israël quittaient l'Égypte par faveur divine , et comme richesse et richesse pour Israël comme Dieu l'avait promis à Abraham.  **\nExode 3 verset 21 à 22  **\n21 Et je donnerai faveur à ce peuple aux yeux des Égyptiens, et il arrivera que, quand vous partirez, vous ne partirez pas à vide ;\n22 Mais chaque femme empruntera à sa voisine et à celle qui séjourne dans sa maison des bijoux d'argent, des bijoux d'or et des vêtements; et vous les mettrez sur vos fils et sur vos filles; et vous pillerez les Égyptiens.  **\nGenèse 15 verset 13 à 14  **\n13 Et il dit à Abram   Sache a coup sûr que ta semence sera étrangère dans un pays qui n'est pas le leur, et qu'elle les servira ; et ils les affligeront quatre cents ans;\n14 Et aussi cette nation qu'ils serviront, je la jugerai; et ensuite ils sortiront avec une grande substance.  **\nL'accent est mis ici sur tous les bijoux forgés, c'est-à-dire l'or ou les bijoux fabriqués par l'homme pour un usage corporel.  **\nNombres 31 verset 51 Et Moïse et Éléazar le sacrificateur prirent leur or, même tous les bijoux ouvrés.  **\nLe Seigneur a empêché Israël de les mettre pour l'ornement ou la beauté du corps physique.\n Exode 33 verset 4 à 6  **\n4 Et quand le peuple entendit ces mauvaises nouvelles, il se lamenta, et personne ne lui remit ses ornements.\n5 Car l'Éternel avait dit à Moïse   Dis aux enfants d'Israël   Vous êtes un peuple au cou raide ; je monterai au milieu de toi en un instant, et je te dévorerai ; C'est pourquoi, maintenant, ôte tes ornements, afin que je sache ce que je dois te faire.\n6 Et les enfants d'Israël se dépouillèrent de leurs ornements près du mont Horeb.  **\nCependant, l'or en tant que substance peut être utilisé par l'homme dans tout autre domaine où il est nécessaire. Les ornements favorisent la satisfaction sensuelle de la beauté corporelle, de la fierté et de la hauteur d'esprit. Ils influencent les femmes à se croire supérieures pour la beauté acquise, les obligeant ainsi à être insoumises à leurs maris. Ils encouragent l'esprit de compétition chez les femmes. Les pauvres d'entre eux ont recours aux boucles d'oreilles et autres bijoux en laiton, argile, bois, etc. Certains utilisent des perles. Le Nouveau Testament révèle que Dieu désire la beauté ou l'ornementation du cœur qui est d'une grande valeur pour Lui. Depuis l'interdiction générale de l'utilisation d'ornements dans\n Exode 33 verset 4 à 6, les saintes femmes qui ont servi le Seigneur depuis cette époque jusqu'à l'époque du Nouveau Testament n'utilisent jamais d'ornements dans leur parure.  **\nPremier pierre 3 versets 4 à 5  **\n4 Mais que ce soit l'homme caché du cœur, dans ce qui n'est pas corruptible, même l'ornement d'un esprit doux et tranquille, qui est de grand prix aux yeux de Dieu.\n5 Car de cette manière dans l'ancien temps aussi les saintes femmes, qui se confiaient en Dieu, se paraient elles-mêmes, étant soumises à leurs propres maris   Cette écriture ci-dessus est d'accord avec\nProverbes 31 verset 30 La faveur est trompeuse, et la beauté est vaine ; mais une femme qui craint le Seigneur, elle sera louée.  **\nLa beauté est vaine mais c'est la femme avec la crainte du Seigneur dans son cœur qui doit être louée. La recherche de la beauté corporelle par l'utilisation d'ornements est une vanité et est condamnée par la parole de Dieu.  **\nPremier Jean 2 verset 15 à 17  **\n15 N'aimez pas le monde, ni les choses qui sont dans le monde. Si quelqu'un aime le monde, l'amour du Père n'est pas en lui.\n16 Car tout ce qui est dans le monde, la convoitise de la chair, et la convoitise des yeux, et l'orgueil de la vie, n'est pas du Père, mais est du monde.\n17 Et le monde s'en va , et sa convoitise ; mais celui qui fait la volonté de Dieu demeure éternellement.  **\nCeux qui les utilisent ne sont pas des saintes femmes, bien qu'elles puissent naître de nouveau. Tous ceux qui sont nés de nouveau ne sont pas de saints enfants de Dieu. L'Écriture suivante montre que vous pouvez naître de nouveau mais ne pas être saint. Il est commandé à tous les enfants de Dieu de se purifier de toute souillure du corps et de l'esprit afin d'être saints.  **\nRomains 12 verset 1 à 2  **\n1 Je vous supplie donc, frères, par la miséricorde de Dieu, d'offrir vos corps en sacrifice vivant, saint, agréable à Dieu, ce qui est votre service raisonnable.\n2 Et ne vous conformez pas à ce monde, mais soyez transformés par le renouvellement de votre esprit, afin que vous puissiez prouver quelle est cette bonne, et acceptable, et parfaite, volonté de Dieu.  **\n2 Corinthiens 7 verset 1  **\nAyant donc ces promesses, bien-aimés, purifions-nous de toute souillure de la chair et de l'esprit, perfectionnant la sainteté dans la crainte de Dieu.  **\nPremier Pierre 1 verset 14 à 16  **\n14 Comme des enfants obéissants, ne vous façonnant pas selon les anciennes convoitises dans votre ignorance ; 15 Mais comme celui qui vous a appelés est saint, de même soyez saints dans toutes sortes de conversations ; 16 Parce qu'il est écrit   Soyez saints ; car je suis saint.  **\nLa sainteté de cœur et de vie est essentielle pour quiconque désire passer l'éternité avec Dieu.\nHébreux 12 verset 14  **\n14 Recherchez la paix avec tous et la sainteté, sans laquelle personne ne verra le Seigneur  \nVous ne pouvez pas vous rendre au paradis avec des bijoux et du maquillage dans votre corps. Ces choses sont des souillures et abominables devant Dieu.  **\nApocalypse 21 verset 27  **\n27 Et il n'y entrera en aucune manière aucune chose qui souille , ni quoi que ce soit qui pratique l'abomination ou qui fasse un mensonge, sauf celles qui sont écrites dans le livre de vie de l'Agneau.  **\nLes pécheurs sont appelés à la repentance et au salut du péché en croyant en Jésus-Christ.  **\n Actes 16 versets 30 à 31 ; 20 à 21  **\nEt les fit sortir, et dit   Messieurs, que dois-je faire pour être sauvé ? 31 Et ils dirent   Crois au Seigneur Jésus-Christ, et tu seras sauvé, ainsi que ta maison.\nActes 20 verset 21 Témoignant tant aux Juifs qu'aux Grecs, la repentance envers Dieu, et la foi envers notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ.  **\n Les croyants sont appelés à la consécration (auto-nettoyage) et à la foi en Jésus-Christ pour la sanctification du cœur et la sainteté de la vie.  **\nMatthieu 5 verset 6 Heureux ceux qui ont faim et soif de la justice, car ils seront rassasiés.  **\nEphésiens 5 verset 25 à 27  **\n25 Maris, aimez vos femmes, comme Christ a aimé l'Église et s'est donné pour elle; 26 afin qu'il la sanctifie et la purifie par le lavage d'eau par la parole,\n27 afin qu'il se la présente comme une église glorieuse, sans tache, ni ride, ni rien de semblable; mais qu'il soit saint et sans défaut.  **\nLa parole de Dieu interdit ce qui suit    **\nJerry curling, permanente, fixation des cheveux, teinture des cheveux, teinture des cheveux, défrisage des cheveux, tissage, coiffure élégante, coupe de cheveux mondaine par les hommes, utilisation de la laine pour agrandir la tresse, utilisation de fil de caoutchouc pour une coiffure brillante, fixation fil normal pour allonger les cheveux, cils artificiels, fard à paupières, sourcils, utilisation de mascara pour foncer et épaissir les cils, utilisation de crayon pour les yeux, utilisation de poudre pour la beauté du visage, blanchiment du corps, utilisation de cortex et de faux ongles, utilisation de rouges à lèvres , utilisation de pantalons par les femmes, utilisation de jupes et de robes courtes, utilisation de robes moulantes, moulantes et décolletées, utilisation de robes sans bras pour révéler les épaules et les aisselles, utilisation de chaussures hautes, utilisation de boucles d'oreilles, bagues, bracelets, collier, chaînes, anneau de nez, utilisation de perles, ongles longs, ongles peints, ongles artificiels, utilisation de pantalons crayon par les hommes, utilisation de robes folles, coupe de cheveux mondaine par les hommes et ainsi de suite.   **\n INSTANCES POUR RÉFÉRENCE  **\n1. La connaissance de la saleté des bijoux dans la parure corporelle et de son attachement à l'idolâtrie n'a pas été révélée à Abraham et à Isaac, mais a été révélée à Jacob et il en a purifié son peuple.  **\nGenèse 35 verset 2 à 4  **\n2 Alors Jacob dit à sa maison et à tous ceux qui étaient avec lui   Otez les dieux étrangers qui sont au milieu de vous, nettoyez-vous et changez vos vêtements.\n3 Et levons-nous, et montons à Béthel ; et j'y ferai un autel à Dieu, qui m'a exaucé au jour de ma détresse, et qui a été avec moi dans le chemin où j'ai marché.\n4 Et ils donnèrent à Jacob tous les dieux étrangers qui étaient entre leurs mains, et toutes leurs boucles d'oreille qui étaient à leurs oreilles ; et Jacob les cacha (enterra) sous le chêne qui était près de Sichem.  **\n2. L'histoire biblique que Jésus a donnée en disant que le père a mis une bague à la main de son fils quand il est rentré à la maison était une histoire laïque et la pratique des hommes laïcs à l'époque de Jésus et de Jésus n'encourageait pas ici l'utilisation de bijoux par le histoire, mais révélait le cœur miséricordieux de Dieu envers les pécheurs repentants.  **\n3. Le portrait de Marie, la mère de Jésus, a été maintenu pendant des siècles sans bijoux parce que c'était l'habillement des saintes femmes à l'époque de la Bible.  **\n4. Les bijoux sont associés aux idoles et portent souvent des pouvoirs démoniaques. En plus d'une fausse beauté, ce sont des atours de prostituée. Ils font partie de la parure des prostituées à l'époque de la Bible.  **\nProverbes 7 verset 10 Et voici, il se rencontra une femme vêtue d'un vêtement de prostituée et d'un cœur subtil .  **\nOsée 2 verset 13  **\n13 Et je visiterai sur elle les jours de Baals , où elle leur brûlait de l'encens, et elle se parait de ses boucles d'oreilles et de ses bijoux, et elle allait après ses amants, et m'a oublié , dit le Seigneur.  **\nPour une compréhension complète de cette doctrine, commandez mon livre   Révélation divine et exposition biblique sur la sainteté des croyants dans les vêtements et les ornements.\n",
