We should wish for the wellbeing of our brothers and sisters (the brethren). Wish for the wellbeing of the members of your Church. Apostle Paul said, I have not shunned to present unto you all that is profitable to you, because I desire your wellbeing. I desire your spiritual welfare. I desire your bodily welfare also, that you may prosper in health. You need it, you should be healthy in the body. If you are not healthy, how will you carry out the work of God? Again he said, I pray God, your spirit, soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord. See how he wished you continue in wellbeing to the end, until the Lord comes for you, either at death or in the rapture. He wishes that you carry your ministry to the end. You need preservation and this prrvation is for your body, spirit and soul. God desires that those who minister to others in the gospel should also minister to themselves, so that they may be first partakers in the benefits of the gospel. The ministers should take care of themselves because God wants full and lasting service. This will happen when we take care of ourselves spiritually and physically.",
